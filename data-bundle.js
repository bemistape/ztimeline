They parked the car about 25 feet inside of the Marshall Ranch property off of the road. They walked the creek towards the pump station. They had the dogs loose and they treed either a cat or a racoon in the area of the Dotta Ranch.

He said it took them about 10 minutes to walk back to the truck. He was at the truck about a total of 5 minutes and a car came in, that has been identified as MRS [redacted]'S, it drove in, turned around and drove back in the opposite direction towards Benicia, again. He states that approximately 5 minutes later they drove in his truck a '59 Chevrolet, red in color, with white wood sideboards, cattle guards, on the sides. They drove this truck back to the Gasser Ranch heading towards Benicia and they passed the car. [redacted] insists that the Rambler was parked on the bank. That would be on the South side. He did not see any person in the car. He estimates he left the area between 11:00 and 11:15PM. He remained at the Gasser's house about an hour and then left out through Highway #21, through the Jamison Canyon and headed home, arriving about 12:30AM.\n\n[redacted] was asked if he had a rifle. He stated that he had a automatic rifle. The RO advised [redacted] of his constitutional rights at this time. Due to the fact that he was in the area and he did have a rifle which he claimed he\nPage 25\nSOLANO COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE FAIRFIELD, CALIFORNIA SUPPLEMENTAL INVESTIGATION REPORT\nCASE NUMBER: V-25564 page 3\nhad with him that night. He was given a receipt for the rifle. The rifle was tested at the S/O by Rangemaster George Parks. On the basis of the findings of George Parks this rifle has been eliminated as a suspected weapon. [redacted] states that FRANK GASSER does own an automatic rifle but that he doesn't have it at the house. He suggested that we call or see a gentleman by the name of HARLAN [redacted] who lives at 106 Marquis Avenue. It is possible that the gun is there, because GASSER does not leave his guns at the ranch because of recent thefts. [redacted]'s car has California license D-26024.\n(Det/Sgt.

The reporting officers while on routine patrol were flagged down on the Lake Herman Road located on East 2nd Street, Benicia, California, north of Interstate 80, by Mrs. Stella Borges who advised that there were two bodies laying alongside the road on Lake Herman Road, just east of the Lake Herman Cottage.\n12-20-68 11:23 P.M. The reporting officers arrived at Gate #10, leading south from Lake Herman Road to the interior near Faraday’s station wagon. This gate is located approximately one and a half miles east of the Lake Herman Cottage. Upon alighting from the patrol unit, the reporting officers discovered a white female lying face down in a pool of blood, which was located on the north (left) side of the road shoulder. A short distance away, near the right rear wheel of the station wagon, was a white male subject lying on the ground. A 1961 Rambler station wagon was found parked on the right shoulder of the road, facing west. The male victim (2) was lying beside the left rear wheel of the Rambler with his head to the west. The victim was unconscious but breathing with a large gunshot wound located on the back of the head and blood oozing from his left ear and mouth. The victim was placed in the patrol unit and rushed to Vallejo Community Hospital, arriving at approximately 11:45 P.M., where he was pronounced dead upon arrival by Dr. J. Byron Sandiford and Dr. J. C. Clark. Victim was identified as David Faraday, 17 years of age, residing at 1939 Sereno Drive, Vallejo, California. The female victim was identified as Betty Lou Jensen, 16 years of age, residing at 123 Ridgewood Court, Vallejo, California.\nThe female victim was lying 28 feet north from the rear of the Rambler, lying on her right side with her head to the west. Examination of the victim revealed five (5) small caliber gunshot wounds in her back. These wounds appeared to have been inflicted by a small caliber pistol, as no exit wounds were apparent.\nThe male victim was found beside the right front door of the Rambler. Examination revealed a gunshot wound located behind the left ear. The bullet was not visible. Examination of the Rambler revealed that the right front door was open.\nA check of the area was made in regards to a weapon, which proved negative.\n(Cont’d – Page #2)\nThe interior of the above vehicle was such that the right front door was standing open and the other three doors closed and locked. The front seat back had been let down into a reclining position. The right rear window had a hole which appeared to have been made by a bullet, with the entire glass shattered, and there was found a hole to the rear of the left rear wheel housing, which appeared to have been made by a bullet.\nThe scene was then photographed, the entire scene and all evidence found by the reporting officers, along with the photos, was turned over to Solano County Coroner Horn and Sergeant Lunblad, Solano County Sheriff’s Office, for proper disposition.\nThere was no disturbance of the crime scene except the removal of Victim #2, and prior to his removal a chalk outline of his body was made by Officer Warner.\nSigned:\n Daniel Pitts, Captain\n William T.

LESLIE LUNDBLAD \nDATE: 1-3-69 \nTIME: 10:15 AM \n\nThe following exhibits were submitted:\n1. Bullet from Faraday's body. \n2. \n3. Two bullets from Jensen's body. \n4. \n5. Bullet found in panties of Jensen. \n6. \n7. Five Super X .22 cartridge cases found at scene by coroner. \n8. \n9. Four Super X .22 cartridge cases found at scene by Sgt. Silva. \n10. \n11. One bullet found on top of 1961 Rambler, Lic DTL 962. \n12. \n13. One bullet found in floor mat, left side storage area of 1961 Rambler, Lic DTL 962. \n14. \n15. One bullet found on ground near Jensen's body. \n16. \n17. Purple dress of Jensen. \n18. \nFINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS:\nExaminations have been conducted of all bullets and cartridge cases present in Items 1 thru 8. Various markings on those exhibits were extensively examined, evaluated and checked against records maintained by this laboratory and our rather large test bullet and cartridge file. As a result of these studies we find that the exhibits correspond only with tests fired in J. C. Higgins, Model 80, .22 automatic rifles. It should not be assumed that the exhibits must have been fired in such a weapon but this is the only type presently in our files which corresponds, therefore, it appears somewhat probable that the responsible weapon was of this type. \n\nIn addition to subjecting to further tests any J. C. Higgins, Model 80 automatic recovered, further tests should be made on any weapons having the following characteristics: \n\na. Cartridge cases: Semi-circular firing pin impression at 12 o'clock position, small extractor markings at 3 o'clock position. Very faint ejector marking at 8 o'clock position (latter may not always be detectable). \n\nb. Weapon barrel or test bullets: Six right hand grooves, land and groove ratio 1:1+. Bullet groove width approximately .056 inch. Bullet land width approximately .060 inch. \n\nIntercomparison of the cartridge cases in Items 4 and 5 indicates that all were probably fired in the same weapon and all are the same make and type of ammunition. Due to lack of sufficient unique structure it appears that considerable difficulty will be encountered in positively identifying the responsible weapon if it should be recovered. \n\nAll bullets submitted were Western copper coated .22 Long Rifle bullets. Although some were damaged it was possible to determine that all but Item 1 contained the same (6 RH) class characteristics. The best bullets were those in Items 2, 3 and 8. Each of these was microscopically compared with the others but in no case was an absolutely positive identification possible. This is apparently due to the condition of the rifle barrel, which does not leave course structure on bullets fired therein, as well as the effect of the copper coating on the bullet. From our examination it appears that a conclusive identification of the responsible weapon will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, even though it should be recovered. \n\nExamination of the dress (Item 9) revealed one hole in the front near the center and five holes on the upper right side of the back. No smoke or gunpowder residue was found in the vicinity of any of these holes except the topmost hole on the back. Near the latter one single grain of gunpowder was found. From these examinations, it therefore appears that the weapon was held at least several feet from the victim at the time of the shooting. The minimum distance it could have been held cannot be established without testing of the responsible weapon when it is recovered. The one single granule of gunpowder found near the topmost hole on the back of the dress may have been transferred by the bullet itself. If not, it would appear that when this hole was produced the weapon was somewhat closer to the victim than in the case of the other holes. \n\nDISPOSITION OF THE EVIDENCE:\nThe exhibits submitted will be retained at the laboratory pending receipt of further instructions. \n\nJanuary 9, 1969\nDAVID Q.

This attack, occurring around 11:15 PM, would later be recognized as the first confirmed murders committed by the unidentified serial killer known as the Zodiac.\\n\\n## The Attack\\n\\nThe young couple was on their first date. After visiting the Jensen home around 8:00 PM, they had planned to attend a Christmas concert at Hogan High School followed by a party. Instead, they drove to the remote Lake Herman Road turnout, a known lovers' lane.\\n\\nAccording to police reports, the killer apparently pulled up either beside or behind the couple's 1961 Rambler station wagon. David Faraday was shot once at close range behind his left ear while still inside or just exiting the vehicle. Betty Lou Jensen attempted to flee, making it approximately 28 feet from the car before being shot five times in the back in a tight pattern. The murder weapon was determined to be a .22 caliber semi-automatic pistol or rifle.\\n\\n## Investigation Details\\n\\nSeveral witnesses reported seeing the victims' car and possibly another vehicle at the turnout that night. Stella Medeiros discovered the bodies around 11:15 PM and flagged down Benicia Police Captain Daniel Pitta and Officer William Warner. Despite finding nine .22 caliber shell casings at the scene, investigators were unable to locate the murder weapon.\\n\\nBallistics analysis by the California Department of Justice indicated the murder weapon was likely a J.C. Higgins Model 80 .22 caliber semi-automatic rifle or similar firearm with six right-hand grooves. The lack of gunpowder residue on Jensen's clothing (except for a single grain) suggested the shooter fired from at least several feet away.\\n\\n## Significance in the Zodiac Case\\n\\nWhile initially investigated as an isolated incident, these murders would later be claimed by the Zodiac Killer in his July 31, 1969 letters to Bay Area newspapers.

SLOVER\nPage 5: SUPPLEMENT - Vallejo Police Department\n- CASE NO. 243-146\n- CRIME CLASSIFICATION: Murder\n- 1:15am 7-5-69 Off. Hoffman\nApprox. 12:10am 7-5-69 writter copied a radio message from KMA 818 regarding two teenagers being shot at in the area of Blue Rock Springs. R.O. had just checked this area approx. 15 min. prior to this transmission, and found the parking lot of Blue Rock Springs clear of people or motor vehicles.\nProceeding to the above area, driving V.P.D. unit 130, and following unit 119. Observed unit 119 make a U-turn on Columbus Parkway just south of the Blue Rock Springs Golf Course. At this time the Police Unit stopped a late model Grey Cad. that was proceeding towards Vallejo on Columbus Parkway. As the driver got out of this Cad. he was reconized by writter as Andy [redacted] Jr. WMA 19yrs. residing at 22 [redacted] Ct. Vlo.\nR.O. then proceeded to Blue Rock Springs parking lot, thus being the first Police vehicle to arrive at this location. It was observed being parked in the southern portion of the parking lot, east of Columbus Parkway. The vehicle described in the Police broadcast as a Brown Corvair, belonging to the victims of the shooting.\nThe first subject observed by this writter was a WMA laying on his back on the ground, at the right rear of the car. This subject was later I.D. as MICHAEL RENAULT MAGEAU WMA 19yrs. DOB 10-29-49 residing at 864 Beechwood, Vlo. This person advised he had been shot but could afford no further info. to this Off. at this time. It was evident this subject in severe pain and suffering from multiple gun shot wounds. Blood was running freely from his mouth, with another wound visible in his lower left leg.\nThe second subject observed by R.O. was a WFA in a sitting position behind the steering wheel of the afore mentioned auto. She was sitting with her head resting on the inside of the left door, at the window level. The observation of this girl was made from the open window of the right door. It was noted that her body bore three bullet holes, veiwing it from this position. There were two gunshot wounds in her upper right arm, and one bullet entry visible in her right side a few inches below the arm pit. R.O. at this point went to the left side of the auto and viewed this girl thru the open left door window. Writter did not observe another bullet wound from this position. But did view a substantial amount of blood splatered about the car. This subject was later I.D. as Darlene ELIZABETH FERRIN WFA 22yrs. DOB 3-17-47 residing at 930 Montery, Vlo.\nAt this point Sgt. Conway arrived at the scene and was informed by R.O. that in fact this was a shooting. Also requested of Sgt. Conway by writter, was to proceed back the area where Police unit 119 was. And in fact detain Andy [redacted] Jr. for further investigation as to the responsibility of this crime.\nOff. D. Clark arrived at the scene next and he plus R.O. attempted to render aid to victims untill the ambulance arrived.\nPage 6: SUPPLEMENT - Vallejo Police Department\n- CASE NO. 243-146.\n- CRIME CLASSIFICATION: Murder\n- 5:15am 7-5-69 Off. Hoffman\nPrior to the arrival of the ambulance, R.O. searched the area of the parking lot in which the victims vehicle was standing. This search discovered what appeared to be seven(7) empty shell caseings. These caseings bore the caliber on the base of the shell, that being a 9mm. These caseings belived to have been ejected from an automatic pistol. The seven (7) empty shells were found a few feet away from the victims auto on the right side. All of these shell cases have been taged into evidence under this case number.\nSolano ambulance arrived and transported the victims to Kaiser Hosp. Writter rode with the victims enroute to the hosp. Neither of these subjects spoke while in the ambulance.\nApprox. 12:38am 7-5-69\nArrived Kaiser Hosp. subject DARLENE FERRIN was attended by Dr. Borc and pronouned Dead On Arrival. Her body was transfered to Twin Chapel at 2:45am 7-5-69.\nSubject MICHAEL MAGEAU was attended by Dr. Jantzen for multiple gun shot wounds and transfered to I.C.U. in critical condition. This subject was wearing an assortment of clothing consisting of three (3) pairs of trousers, one (1) T-shirt, three (3) sweaters and one long sleeved button shirt. These items of clothing were received by R.O. and placed into evidence under this case number.\nDuring the time MAGEAU was being treated for his wounds he remained conscious. He was in severe pain and could'nt tell a continuing story. Through different questions, he gave the following story in segments.\n\"\"A white man drove up in a car, got out, walked up to car, shined flashlite inside and started shooting. Man was older than me, window was down. After stop shooting I got out of car, I tryed to get the people to come over but they drove off. After finally ten minutes the Policeman came.\"\"\nAt the time this subject was taken to I.C.U. this Off. left Kaiser returning to V.P.D. (Hoffman)\nPage 7: SUPPLEMENT - Vallejo Police Department\n- CASE NO. 243 146\n- 7-5-69 6AM - report written\n7-5-69 12:10AM - Rcvd call via KMA 818 that someone had been shot at in the vicinity of Blue Rock Springs & that the compl. would be waiting there. Operator gave detail to Off's Meyring & Lindemann in unit 119. RO also responded from the East side of town & upon arriving on Columbus Parkway in vicinity of golf course, observed detailed officers on a car stop. Off. Meyring advised they stopped the veh because it was in the area & that they were making P.I. reports. RO then proceeded to the parking lot on the E side of street at the park & noted that off. Hoffman was at the scene & a wht male subj. lying on the ground to the rt rear of a 1963 brn Chev. Corvair, 2dr, CRV 209. This subj. with blood all over his face & later identified as Michael R. Mageau, WM, 19 of 864 Beechwood. Prior to getting out of the unit Off. Hoffman requested I return to car stop of Off. Meyring & Lindemann & have them hold the subj's they had stopped. RO proceeded back to carstop & instructed officers to arrest the two subj's, a WM & WF for investigation of felony, & make a search of their veh. RO then returned to Off. Hoffman.\nOn initial arrival, RO requested by radio an ambulance & an investigator at the scene & upon returning to Off. Hoffman RO went to assistance of subj. on ground, as Off. Hoffman was with a subj that was sitting on left front seat behind wheel that was also injured. This subj. later identified as Darlene E. Ferrin, WF, 19, of 864 Beechwood.\nOn prelimanary examination of Mageau, it was apparent that he had been shot a number of times, he had blood all over his face & blood coming from his mouth as well as his left leg with blood. RO felt it was necessary to question subj. inspight of the fact the subj. was in great pain. Subj. was coherent & RO asked him, \"\"do you know who shot you?\"\" & he replied \"\"no\"\". RO then asked Mageau to give me some type of description & he replied that he can't. RO then asked a series of question & was told by Mageau that the resp. was a wht male, young, & heavy set by himself & that he was in a brown veh. RO then asked if the resp. said anything & Mageau replied, \"\"no, he just started shooting & kept shooting.\"\" Questioning continued until arrival of ambulance at which time both veh. was placed in ambulance & removed from the scene. By this time Sgt's Rust, Lynch & Odiorne had arrived at the scene & RO gave them the information obtained from the victim & gave a description over the air to all units. It was at this time it was determined that Sgt's Lynch & Rust would be the investigating officers & the investigation was then turned over to them.\nRO then left the scene upon being advised by radio that the possible resp. had called the station from a pay phone at the corner of Tuolumne & Springs Rd. RO proceeded to that location to cover the detailed unit 122, Off's Agenbroad & Pegg. Upon arriving at that location it was determined resp. was not at that location & the detailed off's were instructed to stand by until an I.D. technician could get there to check for prints. (Conway)\nPage 8: SUPPLEMENT - Vallejo Police Department\n- CASE NO. 243146\n- CRIME CLASSIFICATION: Murder\n- 7-6-69 3:00 PM\n- Location: Intensive Care Unit, Kaiser Hospital\nRO went to location and contacted shooting victim, Michael Mageau. Was advised by Dr. Scott that RO could talk to him for a short time, however he was under medication at this time and would possibly be going to sleep shortly. RO contacted Michael who still was in very bad condition and was very strained to talk as he had had a wound in his mouth. RO asked him if he could as best as possible relate the facts as he knew them as to the occurrences of Friday night when he and D. FERRIN were shot. Michael states that he would do his best to give a statement and gave it as following.\nStates that at approximately 4:00p.m. Friday afternoon, that D. Ferrin called him up, and in their conversation stated they agreed that they would go to a movie in San Francisco that night and she would be at the house at approximately 7:30 p.m. Michael states he next heard from her at approximately 8:00p.m. when she again called and stated that she had to go with her sister, Christine, to the Miss Firecracker contest, that she would call him as soon as she could, as soon as she was clear from this. Michael states that he stayed home and at approx. 10:30 he received another call from Dea stating she would be over shortly. He stated that Dea came over at approximately 11:30 or shortly thereafter and picked him up in her car. They were both hungry as they had not had supper and were going to go get something to eat. Stated that she was driving her vehicle, the Corvair they were found in. Stated they drove west on Springs Road and as they were driving down Springs Road to go get something to eat, Dea stated to him that she wanted to talk to him about something. Michael stated that approximately at the location of Mr. Ed's on Springs Road they turned around and headed east at his suggestion to go to Blue Rock Springs Park where they could talk. They went directly out to this location, pulled the car in the parking lot where it was found by the police. Dea turned the lights and the motor off and had the radio playing. States they were there just a very short time, a few minutes, and three cars pulled in to the parking lot where they were. They were apparently young kids, and they heard some laughing and carrying on and a few firecrackers were set off, then the three vehicles left within a short time. This was just a very short space of time, a few minutes. Shortly after this and about five minutes before the shooting occurred, Michael states a vehicle pulled into the lot, coming from the direction of Springs Road and Vallejo. The driver turned the lights off on the car and pulled around to the left or east side of their car, approximately six or eight feet away and sat there for a minute. Michael states he asked Ded if she knew who it was and she stated, \"\"Oh, never mind.\"\" Michael stated at this time he is always kidding Dea about knowing so many people and does not know whether she meant this as she knew the fellow or not. Michael states as best as he can recall, he could not see the car too clearly, however the shape of the car looked similar to the car that Dea owns, a Corvair. He could not see the color or anything as it was very dark out there.\nEd Rust\nPage 9: SUPPLEMENT - Vallejo Police Department\n- CASE NO. 243146\n- CRIME CLASSIFICATION: Murder\nStates as far as he could tell this car had one male subject in it. The car then drove off and headed in the direction of Vallejo & Springs Road at a fairly fast rate of speed. He stated approximately five minutes later, the vehicle pulled up, coming from the direction of Vallejo & Springs Road. This vehicle pulled up approximately ten feet behind and to the right side of Dea's car, which would be the side that Michael was sitting. The vehicle's lights were left on and the subject got out and walked toward the car. He had a large high-powered flashlight, the kind you carry with a handle. This subject walked up to the car and Michael stated that both he and Dea believed that it was a policeman and that he wanted to check their I.D. or something. Stated subject stepped up to Michael's side of the car, which is the right side, shining the flashlight on them. Subject did not say anything to them, nor did they say anything to him. Michael stated he started to reach for his wallet as he felt it was a policeman who wanted to see his I.D. States as he did so, he heard a muffled sound and felt a pain in his back and his neck area. He states he heard some more muffled sounds, sounding like a gun with a silencer on it, and felt pains in his body, his back and around his neck. States he tried to climb over the back seat to get away from the shooting and subject kept shooting him again and again. States finally the subject quit shooting him and apparently turned the gun on Dea and started shooting her again and again. States subject then turned around and started to walk back to his vehicle which still had the headlights on. Michael stated he could not tell if he meant to yell at the subject or if he just yelled from pain, but he let out some type of yell. At this time, the subject apparently hearing him, came back to the car and shot Michael two more times, once in the back and once in the left leg. States the subject then turned the gun on Dea and shot her twice more. Michael states that all the shots that he heard were muffled, sounding similar to a gun with the silencer on. It was not loud. States the subject then turned around and casually walked back to his vehicle and got in. Michael at this time stated that he had to reach outside the car door to open it as the handle inside was broken. Stated he reached outside and opened the car door and fell outside on the ground. As he fell out onto the ground the vehicle the subject was in backed up in a turning movement and then took off toward Springs Road in Vallejo at a very high rate of speed. Michael states as the vehicle drove off he only saw the rear portion of it, this rear part appearing to be a vehicle similar to or the same type as Dea's car, a Corvair. Also a very similar color, possibly a little bit lighter brown. It had a California license, however he could not tell what the numbers were. Stated the subject continued on Blue Rock Springs Road at a very high rate of speed towards Springs Road in Vallejo.\nMichael states that in what seemed to be eight to ten minutes after this a car came by with three young hippy types in it. He can recall two boys and one girl. States he waved and yelled to the occupants of this vehicle to come over and help him. Stated they came close to him\nEd Rust\nPage 10: SUPPLEMENT - Vallejo Police Department\n- CASE NO. 243146\n- CRIME CLASSIFICATION: Murder\nand he asked them to get a doctor quick. Stated the girl told him to lie still and they would get a doctor. States approximately five to ten minutes later the police arrived in a vehicle that was not a black and white police car and other policemen arrived, and he was then taken to the hospital.\nRO asked Michael if he could give a description of the responsible subject, and he stated as best as he could recall the description is as follows. Subject appeared to be short, possibly 5'8\"\", was real heavy set, beefy build. States subject was not blubbery fat, but real beefy, possibly 195 to 200, or maybe even larger. Stated he had short curly hair, light brown, almost blond. He was wearing a short-sleeved shirt, blue in color. Cannot remember if it was light or dark blue. States he just saw subject's face from the profile, side view, and does not recall seeing a front view. States there was nothing unusual about his face, other than it appeared to be large. Michael stated the subject did not have a mustache, nor was he wearing glasses or anything. He could not recall anything unusual except that he had a large face. Michael reemphasized that he really did not get a good look at subject other than his profile. Also, it was dark out and it was hard to see the subject.\nMichael states that he could possibly recognize responsible if he had a profile view, as this is the best view he had of the subject. Stated subject was a white male, approximately 26-30 years. Was unable to judge real well what his age was. States he feels sure the subject wanted to make sure that they were dead. This due to the fact that he returned and shot each one of them twice again after the first shooting.\nWhen questioned about Dea's vehicle having the headlights on when the police arrived, Michael was unable to explain fully, however states he recalls something about possibly flashing the lights on and off to attract attention of passing vehicles. States he cannot remember if he did this or possibly Dea did it. States while still in the car he called to Dea, does not recall what he said, but recalls the only thing that she was able to do was make a small moaning sound. She was unable to say anything.\nRO questioned Michael as to a possible motive, if he had had any argument or trouble, etc. with anyone recently, or if there was any reason at all that anyone would want to harm him. He stated he could not recall anything at all, having any arguments or anything to give anyone reason to do anything like this. Also st1ated that Darlene did not say anything about any trouble that she has had. States they have always been very truthful with each other and confided very closely in each other's problems and he is sure if she had known about someone after her or had a hate for her enough to do something like this, she would have said something about it.

She could offer very little background information on Phillips and was not in fact around him for any great period of time. Mother stated Darlene had left the family home on Nov. 25, 1965. This happened after a family dispute. The family did not hear from her again until Oct. 1966 when she returned home with her husband, James D. Phillips. Mother has marriage license which shows couple was married in Reno, Nevada, Jan. 1, 1966. When they came to her home Darlene told them she and her husband had just returned from the Virgin Islands where they had spent five months. Phillips told Mrs. Suennen that he \"\"owned\"\" a newspaper in the Virgin Islands and that he was formerly in the U. S. Army as an undercover agent. Subject had no money, no income, no job, and lived off his wife's earnings as a waitress. Couple lived with wife's family. After approximately three weeks Phillips was told to either obtain employment and support his wife or move out.

Mrs. Suennen stated he worked in this capacity for approximately three weeks. (Phillips in fact worked five days and did not show up for work again.) Shortly after leaving the paper both Darlene and Phillips left Vallejo and went to Pennsylvania. They spent several months in Pennsylvania and returned to Vallejo. Their marriage was going poorly and Darlene decided to go to Reno and get a divorce. James apparently did not want a divorce but did not contest same. Records show final decree obtained in Reno on June 2, 1967. Shortly afterwards Darlene remarried and Phillips moved to San Francisco. As far as family knows no further contact between Darlene and Phillips except she contacted him in San Francisco to have him sign some papers pertaining to their divorce. Family had no further contact with Phillips until he attended the funeral of Darlene and was seen by two members of the family sitting in the back row during funeral services. He was with an unknown WFA who was pregnant at the time. There was no conversation between Phillips and family.\nMr. DeLouise had indicated to RO that Mrs. Suennen had told him that Phillips was at one time committed to a mental hospital. RO asked her if this was a fact and Mrs. Suennen stated she had \"\"heard\"\" this but did not know it to be a fact. She was also questioned concerning any particular interest Phillips might have had in astrology or cryptograms. Stated she had on one occasion seen him draw up some type of \"\"code\"\".\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Sgt.

It was a very short duration of time as the responsible had shined a flashlight into his face and almost immediately began shooting him. He then switched the flashlight over to the area where the other person in the vehicle with him, Darlene FERRIN, was seated, and began shooting her. MAGEAU indicated that it was during this span of time that he was able to see the individual who had shot him.\n\n\n\nPAGE 2 OF 5\n\nI advised MAGEAU that I had a group of photographs which I wished to show him, and that the responsible who shot him on July 4, 1969 may or may not be amongst these photographs, and merely because I was showing him pictures, he did not have to identify anyone. MAGEAU indicated he understood this.\n\nI showed MAGEAU a photographic lineup containing six photographs. The fourth photograph to the right in this lineup is that of Arthur Leigh ALLEN. MAGEAU viewed this lineup for approximately 15 or 20 seconds. He then placed his finger on the photograph of Arthur Leigh ALLEN stating, “That’s him.” I asked MAGEAU how sure he was, and he indicated he was pretty sure; that the responsible had a round face like that, and then he pointed to the picture on the right of another individual. The picture he was now pointing to was that of a person whom I could only read the first [redacted]. The lineup is made up primarily of soundex driver’s licenses which have been stapled together, and I do not want to further remove the staples from this lineup at this time to more positively identify this individual.\n\nI asked MAGEAU if he was also identifying this photograph. He emphatically stated “No,” just that the picture also had a round face like that of the picture that he had identified of ALLEN. I asked MAGEAU on a scale of 1–10 how sure he was of his identification of the photograph of ALLEN. MAGEAU stated, “It’s at least an 8. I’m very sure that this is the individual who shot me on July 4, 1969.”\n\n\n\nPAGE 3 OF 5\n\nI then asked MAGEAU if he was shown any other photographs during the investigation of this case. MAGEAU indicated that shortly after the shooting, he was shown a number of photographs which he was unable to identify. He indicates that today is the first time he was shown a photograph wherein he was able to identify a responsible.\n\nMAGEAU also indicated that 8–10 years ago when he was living in the City of Oxnard he was shown some photographs by the Oxnard Police Department and was unable to make an identification at that time. It should be noted that I was responsible for having Oxnard Police Department show a group of photographs to MAGEAU of a suspect that had been developed by the Department of Justice.\n\nMAGEAU was asked if he had heard any of the recent publicity regarding the Zodiac Case. MAGEAU indicated that he had read in a newspaper that a suspect who was a disabled school teacher had been identified as a possible responsible in the Zodiac killings. MAGEAU indicated there was no picture with this article, and he has seen no TV coverage regarding the Zodiac Case recently.\n\nMAGEAU indicates he has never seen the face of the individual he had identified today with the exception on July 4, 1969.\n\n\n\nPAGE 4 OF 5\n\nMAGEAU was then asked if he had ever attended in 1969, a painting party at Darlene FERRIN’S residence. MAGEAU indicated that he had not, but he had heard about this party. He was asked if he knew the name of Ron ALLEN. MAGEAU indicated that name sounded familiar, but he can’t remember for sure. He was then asked if he knew the name of Leigh ALLEN. MAGEAU responded, “I don’t think so.”\n\nMAGEAU was then asked about a lengthy rap sheet which I had obtained from the Department of Justice on him; wherein, he had used approximately 33 aliases. MAGEAU viewed this listed aliases and indicated that he had, in fact, used most of those names. MAGEAU indicated that he had previously been in quite a bit of trouble; that he was now a Born Again Christian and that he attended the First Assembly of God Church as well as the First Baptist Church. And, in fact, the woman with him and her husband were both church members in both of these churches, and they all attended. He was presently residing with this woman and her husband and doing handyman work for them. My impression of MAGEAU at this time that he is sincere in his religious beliefs and has put his lawless past behind him.\n\n\n\nPAGE 5 OF 5\n\nMAGEAU indicated that he would cooperate with this investigation in any way possible. I indicated to MAGEAU that it may be necessary to fly him up to Northern California for a more in-depth interview. He indicated that he would have no objection to doing this. An appointment will be made with MAGEAU for a more in-depth interview.\n\n\nREPORTING OFFICER: G.

There is nothing to worry about - all I want is your money.\nB: O.K. - whatever you say. I want you to know now that I will cooperate so you don't have to worry - whatever you say we'll do. Do you want us to come up with our hands up or down?\nA: Just don't make any fast moves - come up slowly.\nB: But we don't have any money - all I have is 75¢.\nA: That doesn't matter - every little bit helps (pause) - I'm on my way to Mexico - I escaped from Deer Lodge Prison in Montana, Deer Lodge. I need some money to get there.\nB: You're welcome to the money I have, but isn't there something else I can do for you? Give you a check or get some more?\nA: No.\nB: I can give you my phone number and you can call me.\nA: (No reply)\nB: I want to get in contact with you. I am a sociology major and maybe I can even offer you more help than you think you need.\nA: No.\nB: Well, is there any other thing you need?\nA: Yes. One more thing - I want your car keys. My car is hot.\nB: (Reaching into pockets, then patting first front then back pockets) I guess in all the excitement I don't remember where I put them. Let's see. Are they in my shirt, in the ignition, on the blanket.... Say! Would you answer a question for me? I've always wondered. On T.V. movies and in an article in the Readers Digest they say that thieves really keep their guns loaded. Is yours?\nA: (excited slightly) Yes, it is! (then calm and matter-of-fact) I killed a couple of men before.\nB: What? I didn't hear you...\nA: I killed a couple of guards getting out of prison. And I'm not afraid to kill again.\nC: Bryan - do what he says!\nA: Now I want the girl to tie you up.\nC: (reaches for rope that he pulls from back pocket)\nB: This is really strange.

BYRD advised that MISS JUDY was a student at the college and had left the college earlier in the afternoon, driving a yellow Datsun. At 2135 hours Reporting Officers put out an All Points Bulletin around the City and County of Napa for this above described vehicle. At 2137 hours Officers received permission to interview the victim BRYAN HARTNELL who was taken to the X-Ray Room for x-rays. Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Lonergan attempted to interview BRYAN HARTNELL while in the presence of DONALD JUDAH and hospital attendant CLIFFORD MEAGHER. Sgt. Narlow was called away to answer a phone before the interview got under way. HARTNELL appeared to be in extreme pain and also appeared to be in shock. Reporting Officer Lonergan introduced himself to HARTNELL and asked him to give us any information he had on his assailant. HARTNELL stated that the assailant was wearing a black ceremonial type hood, square on top, and appeared to be heavy-set, between 200 and 250 pounds. He also stated his assailant had approached both him and MISS SHEPARD with a gun but had stabbed them with a long knife. HARTNELL further stated the gun was in a black holster and the knife was in a sheath. He stated that the attacker was wearing dark clothing, dark jacket and dark pants. HARTNELL further stated that the gun was an automatic pistol and the knife had a black handle and appeared to be homemade.\nIt should be noted that HARTNELL was very groggy and he was very difficult to interview at that time. Subject was re-interviewed the next day by Det/Sgt. Robertson and gave more complete details. (The report of Sgt. Robertson's interview is attached.)\nAt 2215 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan left the Queen of the Valley Hospital after advising Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and William Munk to take charge of the clothing of the victims and any other evidence from the victims when it was released from the hospital. Munk and Brambrink were also advised to stand by at the hospital as a security measure until other arrangements could be made.\nAs Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan were arriving at the Napa County Sheriff's Office, they were advised by the Napa Police Department that they had located MISS JUDY in the downtown Napa area and were bringing her to the Napa County Sheriff's Office. MISS [JUDY] was interviewed by Lonergan and Narlow at the Napa County Sheriff's Office. She was further identified as MISS JUDITH, a student at Pacific Union College, with a permanent residence address of Sun Valley, California. MISS [JUDITH] advised that she was with BRYAN\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

She stated that they all left Pacific Union College together at approximately 1:00 P.M. and went to a rummage sale in the City of St. Helena. She stated that BRYAN had bought a T.V. set at the rummage sale and had to transport it back to his room at Pacific Union College. She stated he left CECELIA at the rummage sale as there was not enough room in his car. MISS [JUDITH] stated BRYAN returned to the St. Helena area and picked up CECELIA at approximately 2:00 P.M. MISS [JUDITH] stated as far as she knew, both BRYAN and CECELIA were planning to go to San Francisco when they left her in St. Helena. MISS [JUDITH] stated she had no knowledge of any plans that BRYAN and CECELIA were making to go to the Lake Berryessa area. MISS [JUDITH] stated the last time she saw BRYAN and CECELIA was approximately 2:00 P.M. in the afternoon.\nThe interview with MISS [JUDITH] was terminated at that point.\nDet/Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow then proceeded to Lake Berryessa and arrived at the scene of the crime, which was approximately a mile and a half north of Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters, at 2354 hours. The scene was being preserved by uniformed officers and under the direct control of Deputy Sheriffs David Collins and Ray Land. The investigating officers were briefed by Officers Collins and Land as to what had taken place prior to our arrival. Officers observed a 1956 white Kharman Ghia with a black vinyl top, Oregon license plate 4 U 2040. Investigating officers were shown footprints in dirt area and tire tracks, both believed to have been left by responsible. Investigating officers awaited the arrival of Sgt. Tom Butler who had been called to take photographs of the crime scene area and Sgt. Hal Snook, criminalist for collection and preservation of physical evidence. R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were advised by Park Ranger Dennis Land who had also arrived at the scene that it was possible to get to the beach area by vehicle from a locked gate approximately one-half mile south of the victim's vehicle. Officers proceeded to the area and arrived at the footpath approximately halfway between the scene of the crime at the beach and the victim's vehicle on the road. At that point, after a brief examination of the footpath area, officers discovered a similar footprint on the footpath to that found at the scene of the victim's vehicle. At that point, due to the lateness and darkness of the hour, Reporting Officers decided to completely secure the area and make a thorough search of the scene at first light. Officers then exited the crime scene area in the same manner and locked the aforementioned gate leading to this vicinity. Investigating officers along with Park Ranger Dennis Land went to the Berryessa Park Headquarters.\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

These items consisted of a blanket, a pair of man's shoes, a wallet belonging to BRYAN HARTNELL, eyeglasses, and playing cards. Among the various aforementioned items believed to belong to the victims, were numerous strands of white plastic line cut into various assorted lengths, some of which had what appeared to be bloodstains. These items were subsequently turned over to Det/Sgt. Hal Snook for preservation.\nAssigned investigators then proceeded back to the scene where the victim's car was parked and assisted Sgt. Snook in the making of the plaster casts. At approximately 0245 hours Sgt. Lonergan, having previously obtained the keys to the vehicle from BRYAN HARTNELL's property at Queen of the Valley Hospital, drove the white Kharman Ghia to the maintenance shop at Berryessa Park Headquarters. The vehicle was parked inside of the maintenance shop building and the building was secured for the evening by investigating officers with the assistance of Park Ranger Dennis Land. Assigned Investigators then returned back to the scene where the victim's vehicle had been previously parked and awaited the arrival of Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and Mel Fechter who were assigned to security duty in the crime scene area. At approximately 0300 hours officers assumed their duties at the crime scene area and the security was placed under the direction of Deputy Allen Brambrink. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then returned to their respective residences with plans to continue the investigation at daybreak.\n9/28/69 0700 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene at Lake Berryessa area, accompanied by Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Capt. Donald Townsend, and Sgt. James Munk. Officers then assisted Det/Sgt. Snook in tracking the footprints from the vehicle to the scene of the crime by the beach area. (The location and preservation of aforementioned footprints will be detailed in a supplementary evidence report by Sgt. Snook.)\nAt 0800 hours Reporting Officers Lonergan and Narlow received information via Park Headquarters that a DR. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his son would like to talk to them at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop regarding a possible suspect in this crime. At 0912 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan contacted DR. R. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his 16-yr. old son DAVID LEE RAYFIELD at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop. DR. RAYFIELD gave a home address of Los Gatos, California. DR. RAYFIELD stated that about 6:30 P.M. the previous evening he and his son had parked their car north of Park Headquarters in the general area of the\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts.

They stated they went down towards the beach area when DAVID RAYFIELD noticed a white male adult subject walking in the area, described as about 5'10\"\", heavy build, wearing dark trousers, a dark shirt with red in it, long sleeves. He stated this subject was carrying nothing in his hands and was apparently just walking alongside the hill area about halfway between the road and the lake. DAVID further stated that when the subject observed him he turned around and walked up the hill in a southerly direction. DR. RAYFIELD and his son stated that they did not notice a vehicle in the area of their vehicle and only this subject at a distance of about 100 yards. They also advised there was a man with two young boys in the area shooting B-B guns, but they did not know if this man saw the subject or not. This location was approximately 8/10ths of a mile from the scene of the victim's vehicle. In the opinion of R/Os, it is unlikely, unless this male subject had a vehicle in the immediate area, he could have traversed the area to the scene of the crime on foot. There are four coves of water between the scene of the crime and the area where the doctor saw the subject. The interview with DR. RAYFIELD and his son was terminated at that point.\nAt 1000 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene of the crime and further assisted Sgt. Snook in the collecting and locating of evidence.\nAt 1320 hours 9/28/69, R/Os interviewed Ranger Sgt. William White at Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters. White was interviewed as to his activities before and during his part in locating the victims the night before. White stated at approximately 1855 hours 9/27/69 he was on routine patrol around the Lake Berryessa area when he received a call from Park Headquarters to proceed to the Rancho Monticello Resort where a person was reporting a possible stabbing. \nWhite stated he proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort where he was contacted by ARCHIE E. WHITE, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG. RONALD FONG advised him that he had seen a male and a female victim on the beach area south of Rancho Monticello Resort, hollering that they had been stabbed. Ranger Sgt.

According to White, the male victim said that a male subject approached them, wearing a hood, dressed in dark clothing. The subject was carrying what appeared to be an automatic pistol and stated that he wanted their money and car keys. According to White, the male victim related to him that the subject advised him he was an ex-con out of Colorado and was en route to Mexico. Suspect stated he had to tie them up, and after they were tied the responsible stated, \"\"I'm going to have to stab you.\"\" White further related that the male victim advised the responsible, \"\"Stab me first, I can't stand to see her stabbed first.\"\" The male victim then advised that the responsible stabbed him numerous times in the back and then stabbed the girl.\nThe female victim advised White that she could not see the responsible's face as a hood was covering all of his head. She also advised White that the suspect had what appeared to be clip-on sunglasses to cover his eyes. Ranger Sgt. White stated that this is the most he could get out of either victim as they were both in great shock and pain. White stated that he noticed a lot of blood near the girl's groin area. The interview with Ranger Sgt. White was terminated at that point.\n9/28/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort and interviewed MR. ARCHIE E. WHITE. (It should be noted that ARCHIE E. WHITE and ELIZABETH WHITE are no relation to Ranger Sgt. White.) ARCHIE E. WHITE is the owner of the Boat Repair Shop at Rancho Monticello Resort.

WHITE further advised that the female victim told her that the responsible was wearing glasses, with dark clip-on sunglasses over the hood. She told her that the responsible had a black pistol. MR. ARCHIE WHITE stated he overheard the male victim advise someone that the responsible was wearing gloves. MR. and MRS. WHITE further advised that this is the only information either victim gave them on the responsible, and that they spent the balance of the time attempting to make the victim more comfortable until the arrival of the ambulance.\nAfter the interview with MR. and MRS. WHITE, Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan returned to the Napa County Sheriff's Office.\nAt 1620 hours R/O Det/Sgt. Narlow was contacted by a DEAN of the Pacific Union College in Angwin. DEAN advised that three young ladies, students at the college, might possibly have information as to a suspect in the attack at Lake Berryessa. The young ladies were identified as MISS JOANNE, MISS LINDA, and MISS LINDA. DEAN advised that these girls had been in the Lake Berryessa area from about 3:00 P.M. to 4:30 P.M. the previous Saturday afternoon. They had observed a male subject in a late model, silver blue Chevrolet, two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. DEAN advised that the girls had told him they were observed out of the car by this subject while they were sunbathing on the beach. They described the subject as approximately 40 years old, [blank] feet tall, dressed in dark clothing. Sgt. Narlow dispatched Deputy Sheriff Raymond Land to interview these three girls that evening. (The report of Land's interview is attached.)\nReporting Officers spent the balance of the day and evening going through their investigative notes and issuing a statewide All Points Bulletin.\nMonday, 9/29/69 Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan spent the majority of the morning interviewing numerous citizens and officers from other departments regarding this crime and similar crimes. (A general list of possible suspects was begun and they are noted on separate incident reports as to origin of information and description of suspects, attached.)\nReporting Officers were advised by Deputy Sheriff Ray Land who interviewed the three college girls, MISS [JOANNE], MISS [LINDA], and MISS [LINDA] that the information appeared to have some merit and advised that the three young ladies would be in the office in the afternoon for further interview.\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgt.

Donald Townsend.\nLonergan interviewed a MISS JOANNE MARIE, who, [age] years of age, DOB [blank], her address at the college is 114 Dauphine, Pacific Union College, home address South East 12th, College Place, Washington. MISS [JOANNE] advised R/O that on 9/27/69 at approximately 5:30 P.M. she and her two girlfriends parked their vehicle at a location two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. When they left their car they noticed a subject driving a late model silver blue Chevrolet, 2-door sedan, pull up behind them. What appeared to be a white male adult was sitting in the vehicle. They did not observe this subject leave the vehicle. The girls proceeded to the beach area and were sunbathing in their bikinis. After approximately one-half hour had passed, they observed what appeared to be the same subject standing within 40 or 50 feet of them, apparently observing them. This subject was described as 6' tall, weighing 200/210 lbs., muscular build, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing dark pants and a dark pullover shirt. The subject would stare at the three girls but when they looked up at him he would look away. The subject hung around the area for approximately 45 minutes and then the girls observed him walk up the hill. MISS [JOANNE] stated it was very doubtful that from his vantage point in the vehicle the subject could observe the three girls on the beach. She believes he waited in his vehicle and then followed them down after they were on the beach. MISS [JOANNE] further described the car as appearing very conservative. She stated the car did not appear to belong to any young person such as a teenager. She did state the car had California license plates but did not notice the number.\nThe other two young ladies, MISS [LINDA] and MISS [LINDA] were interviewed by Sgt. Snook and Capt.

After about 30 minutes the subject came down by the beach and passed within 20 feet of witness as he walked from south to north. Subject was described by MISS [LINDA] as approximately 28 years of age, 6' to 6'2\"\" tall, 200/225 lbs., black hair possibly styled, with a part on left, rounded eyes, thin lips, medium nose, straight eyebrows, small ears, well built, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing a black short-sleeved sweater shirt, bunched up in front, and a white tee shirt hanging out in back, and dark trousers. The three girls left the area about 4:30 P.M. and the subject's vehicle was gone. Witnesses did not observe the subject either leave or get back into his vehicle.\nMISS LINDA LEE was interviewed by R/O Capt. Donald Townsend. MISS [LINDA LEE] is a WFA, DOB [blank], address Howell Mountain Road, Angwin. MISS [LINDA LEE] is employed as a secretary of the college press. MISS [LINDA LEE] observed the same vehicle which was described as a late model Chevrolet, sky blue in color. The rear tail lights appeared to be long rather than round. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated they parked their vehicle at approximately 2:55 P.M. and observed the subject in his vehicle at that location. The girls proceeded to the beach and she, MISS [LINDA LEE], again noticed the subject about 30 to 45 minutes after they were at the beach. She noticed him standing on the bank approximately 45 yards from her location. She described the subject as 6 feet tall, stocky build, about 200 lbs., black short-sleeved sweater shirt, dark blue slacks, and straight dark hair neatly combed. She guessed his age at approximately 30 years. Subject had medium color skin and was not wearing glasses. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated she thought she saw a white belt around his back but it possibly was a tee shirt hanging out. She further stated that the man was fairly nice-looking, with a round face. She did not observe the subject leave the area in his vehicle.\n9/29/69 - 1600 hours Reporting Officers Sgt. Narlow and Sgt. Lonergan were advised by Capt.

DE PETRIS would complete the autopsy.\nAt 1945 hours 9/29/69, R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were contacted by Probation Officer H. B. Schotte. Mr. Schotte had observed the footprint design that R/Os had taken at the scene and stated he had knowledge of a possible similar shoe sole design. Mr. Schotte brought into the office a MR.

He described these boots as being Government issue, issued to all Air Force personnel at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. They are primarily designed as a wing-walker shoe, however according to MR. [BASSEL] most Air Force personnel and many of the civilian personnel employed at Air Force bases had this type of shoe. The sole design of this shoe exactly matched the plaster cast design that Sgt. Snook had taken at the scene of the crime. It should be noted that Det/Sgt John Robertson had attempted to find a similar shoe design at the local shoe stores in the Napa area with negative results. (Refer Sgt. Robertson's supplementary report.) MR. [BASSEL] was asked if we could keep his shoes for identification purposes and he agreed. R/Os was also advised that this information regarding the type of footprint had not been released to the press or general public. MR.

She stated shortly after they parked the vehicle they observed the victims who were known to them, BRYAN HARTNELL and CECELIA SHEPARD, driving south on Knoxville Road in BRYAN's white Kharman Ghia. She stated as the HARTNELL vehicle drove by, BRYAN waved out the window and said, \"\"Hi, John!\"\", referring to MR. [JOHN]. MISS [MARILYN] stated that they did not see the HARTNELL vehicle any other time that day.\n9/30/69, 0900 hours R/Os Det/Sgt. Narlow and Det/Sgt. Richard Lonergan, accompanied by Sgt.

Kenneth Narlow contacted CAPT. at Travis Air Force Base and arranged for an interview with COL. and SGT. to take place on Wednesday morning, October 1st, 1969, at 9:00 A.M. R/Os wanted to talk to someone at Travis regarding the shoeprints that were found on the scene. The remainder of the day and evening was spent in answering phone calls from people who had possible knowledge of the crime.\nWednesday, 10/1/69 - 0900 hours Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow went to Travis Air Force Base and were present at an interview in Col. office, who is Commanding Officer in charge of base security. Also present at this meeting besides the aforementioned officers was LT. COL. of the Office of Special Investigation. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan advised the Air Force personnel present of the portion of the evidence we had discovered at the crime scene and asked them for assistance in locating where this type of shoe was sold or issued. LT. COL. advised that his office would assist assigned investigators in attempting to locate the source of the shoe.\nOfficers were directed to the Base Supply with the assistance of Special Agent DONALD of O.S.I., at which time it was determined through Base Supply that this shoe in question was of Government issue and that it was not kept in stock at Base Supply, however it was believed that the Sales Store had such an item. It was then explained that if a military person or civilian employee was determined to be in need of such an item, he first reported to the Base Supply, at which time he was issued a purchase requisition which he in turn took to the Sales Store and the type of shoe was issued to the individual and they in turn required the individual to sign the purchase requisition showing that he did receive the item. This purchase requisition states the type of shoe that the individual was to receive, however makes no reference as to size.\nAssigned investigators, accompanied by Special Agent proceeded to the Sales Store located on Travis Air Force Base. After a short period of time R/Os located in stock a shoe fitting the identical description of the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast which officers had in their possession. The identical shoe with identical tread was found and a shoe bearing the closest measurements in the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast was measured and found to be a size 10 1/2 in military styling or a 10 1/2 D in civilian equivalent. It was determined through Air Force records that they were unable to furnish officers with the\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

Air Force records indicate this type shoe is manufactured by the International Shoe Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, then shipped to Air Force Depot, Ogden, Utah, and from there shipped to the various military installations upon requisition orders.\n10/1/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then proceeded to the Vallejo Police Department and met with Sgt. Jack Mullanax and Sgt. Duane Nilsson. Officers exchanged information regarding Vallejo's crime of 7/4/69 and our particular incident. Suspect information was exchanged and is listed in the separate suspect file.\nInvestigating Officers checked to determine the validity of the decoded message and as to how far the original cyphers had been decoded. It was then learned that the message had been decoded by at least two different sources, one being by MR. and MRS. HARDIN of Salinas and the other by the FBI in Washington. It was noted that these cyphers were broken independent of one another and the FBI confirmed the validity of the original decoded message. It was also learned that there was a small portion on the very end of the coded message that had not been decoded for reasons unknown.\nThe balance of the afternoon and evening Reporting Officers and other investigating officers met to exchange information and further discuss the evidence at hand.\nThursday, October 2nd, 1969, 0845 hours Reporting Officer Lonergan received a telephone call from Special Agent, OSI, Travis Air Force Base.

Agent further related he has the names of all the subjects who have purchased this item through surplus and will keep these names available to officers upon request.\nThe balance of the morning was spent searching fingerprint evidence and answering phone calls from possible witnesses.\nThursday, 10/2/69, 1400 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan attended the funeral services for victim CECELIA SHEPARD.

Richard Lonergan contacted JAMES, Napa State Hospital, advised him to set up an interview with a patient who is a possible suspect in our case. The patient is identified as GRIFFIN RAYMOND FRANKLIN, WMA, 20 yrs. of age, DOB [blank], 6'2\"\", 223 lbs. [JAMES] had previously reported that this subject had left the hospital on a pass Friday evening, 9/26/69, and returned to the hospital Monday afternoon, 9/29/69. This subject also had spent time in the Air Force and was discharged from the Air Force in January 1969 for psychiatric problems. According to the doctors at the hospital, this subject was capable of committing this type of a crime. R/O in the presence of JAMES and Security Officer PHIL RYAN interviewed subject FRANKLIN. FRANKLIN was very cooperative and talkative to R/O and went over his activities the prior weekend. Briefly stated, MR. FRANKLIN, whose parents live in Vallejo, never left the Vallejo area that weekend and stayed around home talking with his mother, stepfather, and three brothers. After interviewing subject, it was the opinion of R/O Sgt. Lonergan that this subject was not the responsible. He had a definite very fast manner of speaking which was completely opposed to the victim's statement concerning the suspect's voice. R/O also contacted the mother of the suspect, a MRS. OPAL at Hollywood Avenue, Vallejo. MRS. OPAL stated more or less the exact same thing that her son had stated as to his whereabouts that weekend. It appears that this subject has a reliable alibi as to his activities and had no access to a vehicle that weekend.

Victim SHEPARD had surgery performed on her earlier in the morning (9/28/69) and was unable to be questioned by the Reporting Officer, however Dr. Ludwig gave permission for victim HARTNELL to be interviewed.\nAlthough victim HARTNELL was heavily sedated, he was able to give R/O a verbal statement. (Note: R/O taped electrically the interview with victim HARTNELL.) Victim HARTNELL related the following.\nHe had known CECELIA SHEPARD for some time, they were good friends, and she had come to the Napa County area to spend the weekend. She and a female companion, DALORA LEE, Aspen, Loma Linda, San Bernardino County, Calif. (phone Ext. 2155) had driven from Southern California and were to drive back Sunday, 9/28/69. Victim stated he and MISS SHEPARD drove to Lake Berryessa, picked a large tree near the shore line where they decided to lie down and enjoy the scenery. While lying on the ground, victim HARTNELL stated he heard a noise and asked MISS SHEPARD if she could hear anything or see anything behind a tree not far from where the couple were lying. MISS SHEPARD told victim HARTNELL she could see a man behind the tree. HARTNELL asked her what he was doing. MISS SHEPARD stated she couldn't tell. HARTNELL stated he (suspect) then came from behind the tree. MISS SHEPARD said, \"\"Oh my God, he has a gun!\"\"\nVictim HARTNELL stated the man approached the couple, aiming a black steel automatic pistol. The suspect stated he needed a car and money. Suspect stated his car was \"\"hot\"\" and he wanted victim HARTNELL's car keys. Victim HARTNELL stated he began talking with the suspect, telling the suspect he had no money, only a small amount of change, also that if the suspect was really in need of assistance HARTNELL would attempt to help him.

Victim stated he could also see hair through the mask's eyelets and observed the hair to be dark brown.\nVictim stated suspect was wearing a light-weight windbreaker, dark blue or black, pleated slacks (old-fashioned type). Victim could not remember what type of shoes or anything about suspect's hands, could not remember if suspect was wearing gloves.\nVictim thought suspect was possibly 20 to 30 years of age by voice concept. Victim stated suspect was 5'8\"\" to 6', 225-250 lbs., dark brown hair, eyes unknown, sloppy dresser, stomach hanging over trousers. Suspect spoke with some\nPage 17\n(2)\ntype of drawl, but victim stated it was not a Southern drawl, did not really know what type of drawl, but thought the man was not well educated, but did not feel he was illiterate either. Victim said suspect's voice was moderate in sound, that is, not high or low pitched.\nSuspect told victim he was sent to (?) Lodge State Prison (possibly Deer Lodge State Prison), Montana, for a killing. While there (in prison) he killed a guard while escaping. Suspect also told victims he was heading for Mexico, told victim he was flat broke.\nVictim observed cut-up rope in suspect's rear pocket (trouser's), also stated he was wearing a knife in a case (on belt) on his right side, near front of trousers. Knife description: Appeared to be a long bread knife, 12\"\" long blade, 3/4\"\" wide, hardwood handle, 2 brass rivets holding handle in place, cotton surgical tape wrapped approximately 1\"\" around handle of knife. Knife case possibly made of wood.\nVictim asked suspect if suspect's gun was loaded. Suspect removed magazine from handle of pistol and showed victim a bullet removed from gun, bullet described as a possible .45 caliber. Victim did not know what caliber the pistol was.\nSuspect had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him, suspect then tied victim SHEPARD's hands, then re-tied HARTNELL's hands, then tied both victims' ankles together, had victims lie on their stomachs. HARTNELL stated suspect said, \"\"I'm getting nervous.\"\" This was when suspect was tying MISS SHEPARD'S hands, in fact HARTNELL stated suspect got real shaky when he was tying MISS SHEPARD's hands.\nVictim HARTNELL then stated that without warning the suspect plunged his knife into the back of HARTNELL. Suspect did this repeatedly, HARTNELL stated he thinks six times. HARTNELL stated he pretended to be dead and the suspect went over to MISS SHEPARD and stabbed MISS SHEPARD repeatedly in the back, and when MISS SHEPARD turned her body over (on back), suspect stabbed her in the lower abdomen. Victim stated suspect stabbed MISS SHEPARD much worse than him. Suspect went into some sort of frenzy when stabbing MISS SHEPARD.\nVictim HARTNELL stated suspect left the area after the stabbing. Victim HARTNELL hailed a boat (off shore) and told the man in the boat the couple needed help badly. Victim stated the boat left the area and he (victim) attempted to get help by crawling and walking to the road. (Victim believed he had walked to the road, however had not gone too far from his wounded companion.)\nVictim stated he thought suspect had been with the couple for approximately fifteen (15) minutes from time of observing suspect until suspect departed. Victim stated suspect did not take his wallet, although when MISS SHEPARD was tying victim HARTNELL's hands, she reached in his pocket and threw his wallet to suspect. Suspect did not take the wallet or victim's car keys.\nVictim stated a man in a pickup truck found him on the road and called an ambulance. Victim stated he estimated one hour in time was involved between the time he and MISS SHEPARD were stabbed until help arrived.\nMISS SHEPARD is listed in critical condition.\n\n-------\n\nTranscript\nPage 1\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-321-F9-5861\nSgt. ROBERTSON stated that Mr. HARTNELL was heavily sedated but was able to give a verbal statement pertaining to the attack at Lake Berrysessa. The interview was taped and reads as follows:\n\"\"INTERVIEW OF JOHN ROBERTSON, DET/SGT., NAPA COUNTY SHERIFF's DEPARTMENT, WITH BRYAN CALVIN HARTNELL (NSO CASE #105907) AT QUEEN OF THE VALLEY HOSPITAL ON SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1969 (TRANSCRIBED FROM TAPE RECORDING BY M. FEURLE):\n\"\"J.R. Can you give me this fellow's description and tell me what happened?\n\"\"B.H. So many people have been asking me... I hope...\n\"\"J.R. Well sometimes when we're repetitious, I know it happens to me, I tell the same thing over and over and over, and sometimes I might vary a little, and if you do...\n\"\"B.H. Shall I just start out and tell you what happened?\n\"\"J.R. I don't want to tire you out.\n\"\"B.H. I just don't want this to happen again to anybody... Of course he might have his reasons, I don't know...\n\"\"J.R. Okay. Go right ahead. Start right from the beginning. What happened?\n\"\"B.H. Okay. This girl came out from school, I used to go with her two years ago, and she's now going to another school, and she came up to visit some friends and we were having dinner at the school cafeteria, and I said, 'Well, are you doing anything special this afternoon?' and she said, 'Why?', and I said, 'I don't know. We could go out and either go for a walk, go to San Francisco, or, you know, just...', 'cause we used to be good friends. We used to have a good friendship. And so it got too late by the time we got around to what we were going to do. We had to stop in St. Helena for a couple items and then we had to cart a couple kids home and stuff, and by the time we finally got around to it, it was getting late, and I thought going to San Francisco 'd rush you, you know, because by the time we got back for worship... And so we went out to Berryessa, and there was this one place I used to go out... we used to all the time, you know... and I couldn't find it. And so I figured Ah, forget it, and this looks like as good a place as any. So I parked the car, there were no other cars there. I had a Kharman Ghia, '56, white, with a black vinyl top, and it's in pretty\nPage 2\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n... \"\"good-looking shape. But we parked there on the road's edge and we talked Oh it must be about a quarter of a mile to down to the place where we went. We had... (unintelligible) peninsula, it's an an island I guess during the wetter season, You can see where it was levee... And so that looked like a lot... there was a big spreading tree up there. There were two of them, really, one was a little bigger than the other. We took the one that was out on the point.\n\"\"It was really beautiful out there. We were sitting on top... I lay down on my back and she lay down on her stomach beside me, you know, kind of resting her head on my shoulder, and we were talking, you know, kind of reminiscing about old times, and stuff. And I heard these rustling leaves, and I said, 'You have your specs on. Why don't you see what the deal is over there?' And she says, 'Oh, it's some man.' And I said, 'Is he alone?' and she said, 'Yeah... (unintelligible)...' and she says, 'Well he just stepped behind the tree.' And I said, 'What's the idea of that? To take a leak?' You know, 'cause that's the only thing I could think of, just step behind a tree. And so I says, 'Well, keep looking and tell me what happens,' and she says, 'Oh my God, he's got a gun!' and squeezed my arm and\n\"\"And so he came out, and of course still actually I wasn't... There's some things you really wouldn't mind having happen, just for the experience of it. You know I thought, Well I only got fifty cents on me. It's worth all of that having it happen. I didn't think about another angle. So I talked to him, you know. I said, 'Well listen, Mac, (you know I'm in the sociologist field, you know, I'm pre-law, with history and psych.) You know I've read about the criminal mind and everything, you know. I thought well maybe the guy really does need help, you know. I says, 'There's no strings attached.' I says, 'I don't have any money right now but if you need help that badly I can help you out in another way maybe.' And he says, 'Nah.. time's running short,' he says, ''cause I just got out of... some prison in Montana, I don't know what the name of it is. Feathers? Do you know what the name of it is? I'll see if it sounds familiar. Fern or Feathers? It's some double name, like Fern Lock or something...\n\"\"J.R. It's Lodge..\nPage 3\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. Oh yeah, yeah, Lodge. At least we know we're together on that.\n\"\"J.R. Mountain Lodge Prison, or something of that nature...\n\"\"B.H. Yeah. You know he said he broke out and had to kill a guard getting out. And I said, 'Well, man, I mean actually I don't mean to call your bluff or anything, but wouldn't you rather be stuck on a stealing charge than a threat of homicide?' you know? And he says, 'Well just don't start playing hero on me.' You know, 'Don't try to grab the gun,' 'cause I didn't really figure the gun was loaded. I always thought it would be empty. I've heard a lot of times that this is what they do just as a bluff, but I decided not to call his bluff after he really, you know... I told him, 'You know you're really wasting your time with me. I've got a billfold and this much change and that's it.' And he said, he told the girl, 'Go tie him up. I'd feel much better if you were tied up.' And she tied a couple of loose knots on me, so I made it look kind of tight... (unintelligible)... you know, just for a second, and he said 'Go ahead.' And I whispered to her, 'You know I think I can get that gun.' And I said, 'Do you mind?' and she got kind of fearful about it, so I figured since there's two lives involved, not just mine, I won't do it.\n\"\"So I let her tie me up on the wrists again, and he tied her up, - terribly tight, you know, real... (unintelligible) ... put his gun away, and we were talking and all, bantering, you know, basically. I was thinking, anything I can do to help, by the way just to keep the conversation going... Suddenly he was taking it all seriously, you know... So I was starting out and finally he said, 'Okay, lay down. I've got her tied up', you know... He strung a rope between our ankles in the rear, so we were like this, you know, on our stomachs, tied...\n\"\"J.R. You both facing the ground...\n\"\"B.H. Right. And, oh, this was before. I got sort of ahead. So anyway, he said, 'Get down,' and I said, 'Oh come on! We could freeze to death!' I said that a couple, three times, and he said, 'GET DOWN! RIGHT NOW!' He got a little pushed off at me. So I got down and then he finished tying her up and clonked her down, - and then he goes... Sswhooosh (a sound with his mouth)... (unintelligible)\nPage 4\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"And so I said, 'Do you have bullets in there?' And so he pulled out the clip and showed me that he did. The bullets were about this long, I can remember, and about this fat, and they had the regular red cap on it, about this long. Maybe that doesn't give you any better description of the gun or not. I don't know. And it came out of the heel, the grip, you know. It slipped out from the bottom.\n\"\"And now, to backtrack a bit. I was really trying to see what he looked like, you know. He had on pleated pants, these old type of suit pants, you know, and they were either black or dark blue, I can't remember now. And I can't remember what he was wearing for shoes. But he had on this cotton coat, You've seen the kind, that you just turn the collar up once, there's a zipper down the front, you know. They're real light, super-thin, you know...\n\"\"J.R. Kind of a windbreaker...\n\"\"B.H. Yeah, like a windbreaker. And it's got this blue, this little collar, sometimes the guys wear them standing up, you know.\n\"\"J.R. What color was that?\n\"\"B.H. That was dark blue. And I don't know. Maybe he had something in his pouch. I just took it as being a... as being a... you know, he was stout 'cause he looked kind of heavy. I think he was weighing two and a quarter, two fifty, somewhere in there. And I got kind of a look at his hair. His voice... I can remember... almost like I'd heard it before. You know there's some drawls that a lot of people have similar. And... almost as if I'd heard it before... couldn't think where.\n\"\"I gave that one up, I just gave it up on that angle. I looked through his hair. I kind of looked like it was combed, you know, like this.. it was a brownish, you know, dark brown hair.\n\"\"And this mask he had on. It was ingeniously devised. It was... he had four corners at the top, like the top of a paper sack... black. It came down, came down, with the front panel about to here, and a kind of a thing that came over the shoulders, you know, and then the same thing down the back, straight down. And in the front he had a circle with a symmetrical cross in the middle. You know what I mean by a symmetrical cross?\nPage 5\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. Um hum (affirmative).\n\"\"B.H. The ends of the cross hung out about this far on each of the... you know, where it came out. The circle was this much... like this... and then it was like this, you see... hung out on the end, over the edge of the circle.\n\"\"And he had clip-on sunglasses... it was hard to tell. You know, the sunglasses you clip on when you're wearing glasses, eyeglasses, He had those clipped on. I'm pretty sure... I don't think he had glasses, though. I think he just had these clipped on to his suit... you know, that little mask.\n\"\"And I don't know how tall he was. Maybe 5-8 or maybe 5-10, 6 feet, somewhere in there. I'm a very poor judge of height because of my height. I have no meaning, you know. It's always down, you know. It can never be up...\n\"\"And so I saw him put away his gun, and I was turning to say something to Celia, and all of a sudden I felt my back... just... no, I think I saw him pull it out.. I don't remember... I think I saw him whip out his knife and just start stabbing me in the back... CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP! I was just (makes a gutteral sound)... you know that kind of a sound... and Celia turned to see why I was (repeats gutteral sound), you know, and she just about fainted. She went hysterical... (unintelligible) ... and when he finally stopped... I mean he went over and... The doctor says there's six in the back, six wounds on my back. You ought to confirm that. One I've got went clear through the lung. I've got it draining. I did drain a couple pints of blood out as soon as I got here. I lost an awful lot of blood, I guess.\n\"\"We were down... I mean it was absolutely no question in my mind... when a person gets stabbed as many times as we did... we were going to die. I mean there'd be no reason to question it. But somehow I, you know, started (unintelligible)... I just knew there was too much I had to live for. I mean really it does happen... about getting depressed and everything... when you're young you always think about these things... you know you think about it... and when you've got someone forcing your hand, oh well, there was a lot of things I had to do. And what really kept me going... you know my parents are pretty Christian. I haven't been too much of a Christian myself... but if you believe in the principle you ask God to help you. Another thing, What was my only strength was knowing two things. One, that I did not want to die, and two, that I felt that whatever was\nPage 6\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n\"\"going to be was going to be, but I was going to try my damnedest to stay alive. And so, like I say, - before I left her I kissed her, and I said, 'Well,' I says, 'I'm gonna try to get help.'\n\"\"There was a boat kept circling around out there in the lake and we started yelling at it and finally it came within about 100 yards of the shore and turned off its motor and stayed there watching us for about fifteen minutes, and we were just screaming hysterically, trying to get their attention, you know, to come over here. Oh, I don't know, I guess they were afraid that the guy might be there in the bushes and they were liable to get choked or something. So finally he came up a little closer. I didn't have my glasses on... I was just swaying, you know... and I had gotten one of her hands free before they came, and so I kept trying to get her to untie me, and she couldn't, she was too weak, she said.\n\"\"So finally I just kept hollering and hollering, and she said, 'Turn around and let's see if I can do it again.' She finally got it. My hands and my feet were just pure numbness... they're still numb but I'm sure that will go 'way. But I finally got... (unintelligible)... untie her so she could kind of relax out. 'Cause it was a terrible position, you know, upon our stomachs... (unintelligible)...\n\"\"And so I started to go for help. I finally got myself fairly reconciled. I wasn't too worried about dying, if that was what was going to happen, but I knew I had to keep pushing on. I had to force myself into staying alive because it was... I could just see myself... you know, all sort of waves would come over... I just (coughing sound)... (unintelligible)... 'Well, you're not gonna give up this easy', you know. And, like I say, I just kept believing that God would do everything the best, if the thing was gonna happen, but I couldn't see any reason why my dying would be the best good. So I just played along with that.\n\"\"I just started to walk toward the road... everything blacked out on me... my visual... my mind was never blacked out, but my visual was. So I lay down... My eyes started to come open... I just saw a haze of trees, you know. In a little while I got up and went another twenty feet, and then the same thing happened... (unintelligible)... and sat down. Next thing I went clear... (unintelligible)... the road, and by that time I just fell... I just... I was trying so hard to go far I just went too far. Finally I heard this pickup\nPage 7\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"coming... I was just laying alongside the road, and that's where this guy picked me up.\n\"\"They weren't in any hurry at all, it didn't seem like, you know, but they finally called an ambulance. About fifteen minutes later it came... (unintelligible)... but I still believe... I've got feeling... starting to get a little pain to come through. But from the minute that knife blade went in, it was nothing but pure shock from there on. I just did not expect it. I didn't expect that he would do that. That was a variable I had completely left out. And I guess he just took off running after we started running. I don't know. I never saw him before and hope not to see him again... at least outside of a courtroom.\n\"\"It's hard for me to explain much more. I mean I'm trying to give you a kind of example of his technique. He had some rope cut up in his back pocket. And he had a ... well, I thought it was a police automatic because it was in one of these black leather cases, you know...\n\"\"J.R. Was it in a smooth case, or did it have a basket weave like..\n\"\"B.H. Can I have my glasses? Oh, they're not here. It was a smooth one, though.\n\"\"J.R. Did he have this hood down to about the middle of his chest?\n\"\"B.H. No, about like... well, I'll show you... Here... his stomach.. You know I could see his... (voice fades away)\n\"\"J.R. Okay. You said his hair looked dark brown. How could you see his hair?\n\"\"B.H. 'Cause I saw it from where those goggles fit. I looked so closely to find out. And when he turned you know they kind of flittered... I could see his hair. It looked kind of greasy.\n\"\"J.R. Now was he as heavy as I am?\n\"\"B.H. Well I can't say 'cause he wasn't wearing those type of clothes. They were sloppy clothes, you know. And he just had on this old pair of pleated pants. I don't know... How tall are you?\n\"\"J.R. I'm about five eleven.\nPage 8\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. Well, like I say, he was dressed kind of sloppily, you know. His pants real tight up here and his stomach kind of pouched a bit, you know. I don't know... it's hard to say 'cause I can't judge you with being in a suit and all, you know, and him not being professional-looking at all. He could be about the same. It's hard to say. He was so sloppily dressed.\n\"\"J.R. Bryan, you also mentioned a drawl. Well not a drawl, an accent.\n\"\"B.H. It was just something... I guess his way of talking. It was something I couldn't repeat. It's like a song. Sometimes you know what you're going to say but you just can't sing the melody worth a darn.\n\"\"J.R. Did he have a throaty voice or a high pitched?\n\"\"B.H. In between. But it was just a unique way of talking.\n\"\"J.R. Did he sound like an educated man?\n\"\"B.H. Heck no! I don't think so.\n\"\"J.R. Did he sound illiterate?\n\"\"B.H. No. He didn't sound that way either. He just impressed me as being rather low class. The reason was because of his clothes, you know.\n\"\"J.R. Did you lose consciousness when he stabbed you at any time? Did you observe him stab Cecelia?\n\"\"B.H. Yeah...\n\"\"J.R. What did he say after...\n\"\"B.H. He stabbed her a bunch of times in the back. After she turned around, he got her once in the groin and one in the arm I think. He kind of went a little more hog-wild with her than with me. I faked dead... like that... I didn't want him to come back and give me some more.\n\"\"J.R. So you were pretty sure he thought you were dead when he finished working on you?\nPage 9\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. I think he kind of thought that. Of course I don't know because we started talking right after he left. It's hard to say... (unintelligible)... I don't think she fainted either.\n\"\"J.R. Was she in a lot of pain, did she tell you?\n\"\"B.H. Oh yeah. She was more weak at the time... (unintelligible).. from the religious angle. I told her I sure as heck wasn't going to have any deathbed conversion. 'No,' she says... (unintelligible)... I mean it was just like you were gonna die and had a few things to say. But I felt more and more I wasn't losing strength as much... (unintelligible)... that I thought I could cope with...\n\"\"J.R. What you did was a courageous thing. It was a terrible thing to have happen to anyone.\n\"\"B.H. Well there was nothing we could do. We were kind of at the mercy of him. I mean I wanted to get that gun... (unintelligible)... There was a time I think I could have gotten it...\n\"\"J.R. Did it appear to be a .45 to you? An automatic?\n\"\"B.H. It was about this long... along the stock... and had a wood edge on it, you know.. on either side...\n\"\"J.R. Handles.\n\"\"B.H. Yeah...yeah...\n\"\"J.R. Did the bullet look anything like that?\n\"\"B.H. No. It was kind of like this, only it was gold, and this part here came out along with this and then round the gold, round the blunt end. Not quite that blunt-ended, though.\n\"\"J.R. Was it fat? Fatter than this?\n\"\"B.H. Yeah, I think it was a little fatter. But it was gold, you know. And I didn't see any of this here. There was a part where it crimped... Well, almost like that 22, short, only a lot bigger. It was about like this length, maybe more stubby.\nPage 10\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n\"\"J.R. Well I'll get a .45 a little later and we can bring it up and let you observe it.\n\"\"B.H. \"\"Let's take the suspect. His hands... I don't remember if they had gloves on or not. I can't remember now. I keep thinking that he had gloves on. I can't figure how he tied us... Let's ask Celia, she probably knows about that.\n\"\"J.R. Did he swear? Did he use any profane language or obscenity?\n\"\"B.H. I don't think so. If he did it was no more than I was using at the time. I don't think he used any obscenity. He might have used a swear word or something, you know. That wasn't striking to me...\n\"\"J.R. Do you have any idea what his motive might have been? Money?\n\"\"B.H. Money. He said he was going to go to Mexico and he was flat broke.\n\"\"J.R. Did he search you after he...\n\"\"B.H. Heck no! Very unprofessional. He didn't even end up taking that loose change and didn't even take my billfold.\n\"\"J.R. Why did he stab you when you weren't fighting him off or anything?\n\"\"B.H. I couldn't. Even if I'd have wanted to. I was laying on my stomach...\n\"\"J.R. So what would have been the purpose of him to stab you, do you think?\n\"\"B.H. Well I (unintelligible)...but I think he got rattled... (unintelligible)... very, very nervous. His hands were shaking... (unintelligible)... Are you nervous?\n\"\"J.R. I'm just curious. If you could write me that symbol you were telling me about. Do you think you could draw me a picture of that even without your glasses?\n\"\"B.H. Um hum (affirmative). (Draws)... kind of like that. I can't see very well...\nPage 11\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. Yes, I see. Okay...\n\"\"B.H. ... (unintelligible)... that I could really die...\n\"\"J.R. Does this ring a bell?\n\"\"B.H. This one here. This is more like it, but I'm not sure. It was distinctly that design. It was thick. More thick marks.\n\"\"J.R. Okay. What color was this? Do you recall?\n\"\"B.H. Black. And that was white.\n\"\"J.R. This was black.\n\"\"B.H. No, that was white. It was about this tall.\n\"\"J.R. Two and a half, three inches?\n\"\"B.H. About four by four... three by three...\n\"\"J.R. How do you feel? Am I tiring you out too much?\n\"\"B.H. No. I've had a couple shots. It's not hurting me at all.\n\"\"J.R. Do you think Cecelia could tell me any more than you have already told me? Add anything?\n\"\"B.H. (unintelligible)\n\"\"J.R. Did he slap you around? Slap her?\n\"\"B.H. (unintelligible)... No.\n\"\"J.R. He was a much smaller man than you?\n\"\"B.H. Not much. About your height I guess. I don't know.\n\"\"J.R. Well you're getting kind of sleepy. I'll ease up on you.\n\"\"B.H. Have you gotten any clues at all?\n\"\"J.R. Yes, we've got some good clues. Before we get this guy it's going to take a lot of work.\n\"\"B.H. Remember he said he was headed for Mexico,\nPage 12\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. He's headed for Mexico?\n\"\"B.H. That's what he said.\n\"\"J.R. I'll leave you my card. It's right up here. I'm going to go down and talk to your mom and dad.\n\"\"B.H. Have the news heard about this at all?\n\"\"J.R. Yes.\n\"\"B.H. Was there anything in the paper today?\n\"\"J.R. No, it wasn't in...\n\"\"B.H. The Napa paper?\n\"\"J.R. Well there's no Napa paper on Sundays. It's been on the news media...\n\"\"B.H. Names? Did they name my name?\n\"\"J.R. I don't know, to tell you the truth.\n\"\"B.H. The reason I asked is my girl friend lives in Portland and I've got to talk to her before it gets to her...\n\"\"J.R.

received by stand-in dispatcher Dave Slaight who heard Zodiac speak the words \"\"I want to report a murder, no, a double murder. They are two miles north of Park Headquarters. They were in a white Volkswagen Karmann Ghia. I'm the one that did it.\"\" After completing his message the Zodiac Killer, probably learning from his experience at Blue Rock Springs, failed to hang up the phone. Dave Slaight contacted the Sheriff's Office to inform them of the call, and at approximately 7:45 pm the Napa County Sheriff's Office, unable to trace the call, asked for assistance - and a news director at KVON radio by the name of Pat Stanley sprang into action after hearing about the brutal attack on his police scanner.\n\nHe stated \"\"The receiver on the phone the Zodiac used was put down, but not hung up. Technology then was not like it is today. The phone company could only report that the call came from a pay telephone somewhere between Lake Berryessa and Napa. The Napa County Sheriff's Department wanted to find the phone, and fast, so virtually any official with a radio was asked to help. This reporter jumped into action. After a brief stop at the Sheriff's Department, I drove north on Main Street. Driving past a car wash and the historic Sam Key Laundry Building, I spotted a pay phone, but thought the call must have come from closer to the lake, nearly 30 miles away. At the last second, though, I swerved my car toward the phone booth and was shocked to find the receiver off the hook. I used my own two-way radio back to KVON where I instructed the on-duty deejay to call police. They, in turn, told me not to move until officers arrived.\"\"\n\",3,1,1,1969-09-27,1969-09-27,\"Zodiac, David Slaight, Napa Police\",Napa PD Pay Phone Call,Fact,https://www.zodiacciphers.com/zodiac-news/the-payphone-call-at-main-street,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"errorType\"\": \"\"emptyDependency\"\", \"\"isStale\"\": false, \"\"state\"\": \"\"error\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2026-02-15T17:19:09.000Z,true,\"Pay Phone at Main and Clinton Streets, Napa, CA\",napa-pd-confession-call,9,recQuYLdGf36hNmut,,Immediate Aftermath,,\nrecuOuUGfQpwjuGqq,Death of Cecelia Shepard,1969-09-29,56700,recGa0aCpwMM0jQkt,\"Shepard died two days after the attack at Queen of the Valley Hospital;

The suspect appeared to be searching the victim’s pockets. (Witnesses never heard a gunshot.)\nThe suspect was observed wiping [fingerprints] on the interior of the cab, leaning over the victim toward the driver’s side. He then exited the cab from the right-hand passenger door, walked around to the driver’s side, and wiped the exterior and interior surfaces near the driver’s door and dashboard.\nThe suspect then walked north on Cherry St. toward Jackson St. The witnesses immediately notified the police.\nResponding officers checked the interior of the cab and found the victim slumped over the front seat, head in the passenger area, blood flowing from a wound to the right rear of the head. Fire Department Rescue responded; victim pronounced dead at 10:10 p.m.\nInspector Krake and Inspector Toschi notified. The crime lab was called to the scene. Photos taken; body removed to the morgue.\nThe meter of the cab was still running, reading $6.25 at 10:46 p.m., indicating the victim may have picked up the fare at approximately 9:40 p.m.\nYellow Cab #912 towed to Hall of Justice for fingerprint work.\nNarrative (page 2)\nInspector Armstrong and Inspector Toschi responded and took charge. Captain Kidwell also responded. The Homicide Detail established headquarters at the scene.\nThe coroner, Deputy Schultz, arrived and removed the body. Coroner’s report attached.\nCrime lab photographed the scene; Dagitz and Kirkland technicians present. All physical evidence retained by the lab.\nThe Yellow Cab, California Lic. #17 1413, was impounded. Broadcasts describing the suspect were sent citywide.\nThe victim was devoid of any U.S. currency and did not have his wallet; ignition keys for the cab were missing.\nSuspect Description\nWhite male, early 40s, 5′8″, heavy build, reddish-blond crew-cut hair, wearing glasses, dark (navy blue or black) “parka” jacket, dark trousers, dark shoes.\n Suspect likely had bloodstains on clothing and possibly carried the victim’s wallet and cab keys.\n Last seen walking north on Cherry St. from Washington St.\nProperty / Evidence\n• Loss to be determined.\n • Victim’s property in possession of the coroner.\n • Yellow Cab #912 towed to Hall of Justice for homicide prints.\n • Crime-lab findings indicated the weapon was small-caliber and fired from close range.\nReporting Officers:\n Frank Peda #212 | Armond Pelissetti #1879\n Inspector: Paul Kiel\n Division: Homicide / Robbery – Taxi Detail\n Filed: 10-12-69, 12:30 a.m.\n,Title: The Stine Letter\n\nDate: 1969-10-13T00:00:00.000Z\n\nAuthor / Source: Zodiac\n\nOrigin / Postmark: San Francisco\n\nEvents: The Stine Letter w/ Shirt Piece, The Murder of Paul Stine in Presidio Heights, \"\"Stine Letter is published, Zodiac linked\"\"\n\nRelated People / Groups: San Francisco Chronicle, Zodiac, Paul Lee Stine\n\nTags: Paul Stine's Taxi Murder, Zodiac Letters\n\nLocations: Site of Paul Stine's Murder\n\nSource: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Zodiac_Killer_letter,_October_13th_1969\n\nText: Mailed: Oct. 13, 1969\nPostmarked: San Francisco, Calif.\nSent to: San Francisco Chronicle\n\nThis is the Zodiac speaking.\nI am the murderer of the taxi driver over by Washington St & Maple St last night, to prove this here is a blood stained piece of his shirt.

This subject was not stopped as the description received from communications that a negro male. When the right description was broadcast reporting officer informed communications that a possible suspect had been going north on Maple Street into the Presidio. The area of Julius Kahn playground and a search was started which had negative results.\n\nThe suspect that was observed by officer Fouke was a WMA 35-45 yrs, about 5’10”, 180-200 lbs, medium heavy build – barrel chested – medium complexion – light colored hair possibly graying in rear (may have been lighting that caused this effect) crew cut – wearing glasses.

This attack marked a significant shift in the Zodiac's pattern, as it was his only confirmed killing in San Francisco and his only known use of a handgun in an urban setting.\\n\\n## The Crime\\n\\nAt approximately 9:55 PM, Stine, driving Yellow Cab #912, picked up a passenger at the intersection of Mason and Geary Streets in downtown San Francisco. The passenger requested to be taken to Washington and Maple Streets in the affluent Presidio Heights neighborhood. However, for unknown reasons, the cab stopped at Washington and Cherry Streets, one block beyond the requested destination.\\n\\nThere, the passenger shot Stine once in the head with a 9mm semiautomatic pistol at close range. Three teenagers witnessed the crime from their home across the street and observed the killer searching through Stine's pockets and wiping down areas of the cab, presumably to remove fingerprints. The witnesses called police as the killer calmly walked north on Cherry Street toward the Presidio military base.\\n\\n## Police Response\\n\\nOfficers Frank Peda and Armand Pelissetti responded to the scene. Due to a dispatcher error, responding officers were initially told to look for a Black male suspect. This miscommunication may have contributed to a critical missed opportunity when SFPD officers Don Fouke and Eric Zelms reportedly passed a white male matching the Zodiac's description walking east on Jackson Street, but did not stop him because they were looking for a Black suspect.\\n\\nWhen police arrived at the scene, they found Stine's body slumped over in the front seat with a fatal gunshot wound to the right side of his head. The cab's meter was still running, showing $6.25 at 10:46 PM. Stine's wallet and the cab keys were missing. The victim was pronounced dead at 10:10 PM.\\n\\n## Zodiac's Claim\\n\\nTwo days later, on October 13, the San Francisco Chronicle received a letter beginning with \\\"\"This is the Zodiac speaking.\\\"\" The letter claimed responsibility for killing \\\"\"the taxi driver over by Washington St & Maple St last night\\\"\" and included a blood-stained piece of Stine's shirt as proof. This physical evidence definitively linked the letter writer to the crime.\\n\\nIn the letter, the Zodiac criticized police for failing to catch him, writing: \\\"\"The S.F. Police could have caught me last night if they had searched the park properly instead of holding road races with their motorcicles seeing who could make the most noise.\\\"\" He then made his most chilling threat yet: \\\"\"School children make nice targets, I think I shall wipe out a school bus some morning. Just shoot out the front tire & then pick off the kiddies as they come bouncing out.\\\"\"\\n\\n## Investigation\\n\\nBased on descriptions from the teenage witnesses, police created a composite sketch of the suspect: a white male in his early 40s, approximately 5'8\\\"\" with a heavy build, reddish-blond crew-cut hair, wearing glasses and a navy blue or black jacket. The crime scene yielded what investigators believed were the killer's fingerprints, though the Zodiac later claimed in correspondence that he had used glue on his fingertips to avoid leaving prints.\\n\\nThe murder of Paul Stine is significant because it represents a departure from the Zodiac's previous pattern of attacking couples in secluded areas. This urban killing of a lone male victim demonstrated the killer's boldness and adaptability. The threat against schoolchildren that followed led to heightened security measures, with police cars and aircraft following school buses and armed officers riding onboard for protection.\\n\\nPaul Stine was cremated following a funeral service at the First Unitarian Church in San Francisco on October 14, 1969. He was survived by his wife Claudia, and was remembered as a graduate student at San Francisco State and a life insurance agent for Northern Life Insurance Company.\\n\\nDespite extensive investigation, including the examination of numerous suspects over the decades, the Zodiac Killer was never identified or apprehended, and the murder of Paul Stine remains officially unsolved.\"\"}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2026-02-15T17:19:09.000Z,true,Site of Paul Stine's Murder,the-murder-of-paul-stine-in-presidio-heights,11,rec7ir3vRKETmXfrI,,Crime Night,,\nrecATdf0n9etcTyEl,The Stine Letter w/ Shirt Piece,1969-10-13,,recXWIp8s3P3TAYiu,\"Letter beginning “This is the Zodiac speaking” claimed the Stine murder and enclosed a blood-stained piece of his shirt. \n\",,\"recGZwp9mtC6qB9Hd,recIi4fFkzHRAIpD0\",https://zodiackillerfacts.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=5,\"image.png (data/media/attR8KiwYtTpE8oLL_image.png),Stine_Envelope.PNG (data/media/att81lyfQr4TTbS9w_Stine_Envelope.PNG),10.13.69Inside.PNG (data/media/attP5Kw72aYxDls9h_10.13.69Inside.PNG)\",reczWfmvvVX3Hr9oM,rec9jKpROct4rZkrc,\"recqHvlmSyXK7UYJo,recNDQiiKZS8J0t9h\",1969,October,Monday,rec7ir3vRKETmXfrI,Z Communication,1969-10-13T00:00:00.000Z,10/13/1969,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=The%20Stine%20Letter%20w%2F%20Shirt%20Piece&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=The%20Stine%20Letter%20w%2F%20Shirt%20Piece&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2025-09-03T00:02:19.000Z,,,1969-10-13T00:00:00.000Z,\"image.png (data/media/attgRBlfQ1XAZU3Rl_image.png),image.png (data/media/attNFORujpuGRNVhE_image.png)\",\"Title: The Stine Letter\n\nDate: 1969-10-13T00:00:00.000Z\n\nAuthor / Source: Zodiac\n\nOrigin / Postmark: San Francisco\n\nEvents: The Stine Letter w/ Shirt Piece, The Murder of Paul Stine in Presidio Heights, \"\"Stine Letter is published, Zodiac linked\"\"\n\nRelated People / Groups: San Francisco Chronicle, Zodiac, Paul Lee Stine\n\nTags: Paul Stine's Taxi Murder, Zodiac Letters\n\nLocations: Site of Paul Stine's Murder\n\nSource: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Zodiac_Killer_letter,_October_13th_1969\n\nText: Mailed: Oct. 13, 1969\nPostmarked: San Francisco, Calif.\nSent to: San Francisco Chronicle\n\nThis is the Zodiac speaking.\nI am the murderer of the taxi driver over by Washington St & Maple St last night, to prove this here is a blood stained piece of his shirt.

I have grown rather angry with the police for their telling lies about me. So I shall change the way the collecting of slaves. I shall no longer announce to anyone. When I comitt my murders, they shall look like routine robberies, killings of anger, & a few fake accidents, etc.\nThe police shall never catch me, because I have been too clever for them.\n1. I look like the description passed out only when I do my thing, the rest of the time I look entirle different. I shall not tell you what my descise consists of when I kill\n2. As of yet I have left no fingerprints behind me contrary to what the police say in my killings I wear transparent finger tip guards. All it is is 2 coats of airplane cement coated on my finger tips—quite unnoticible & very efective.\n3. my killing tools have been boughten through the mail order outfits before the ban went into efect. Except one & it was bought out of the state.\nSo as you can see the police don't have much to work on. If you wonder why I was wipeing the cab down I was leaving fake clews for the police to run all over town with, as one might say, I gave the cops som bussy work to do to keep them happy. I enjoy needling the blue pigs. Hey blue pig I was in the park—you were useing fire trucks to mask the sound of your cruzeing prowl cars. The dogs never came with in 2 blocks of me & they were to the west & there was only 2 groups of parking about 10 min apart then the motor cicles went by about 150 ft away going from south to north west.\nMust print in paper [bolded areas below]\nps. 2 cops pulled a goof abot 3 min after I left the cab. I was walking down the hill to the park when this cop car pulled up & one of them called me over & asked if I saw anyone acting suspicious or strange in the last 5 to 10 min & I said yes there was this man who was runnig by waveing a gun & the cops peeled rubber & went around the corner as I directed them & I disappeared into the park a block & a half away never to be seen again.\nHey pig doesnt it rile you up to have your noze rubed in your booboos?\nIf you cops think I'm going to take on a bus the way I stated I was, you deserve to have holes in your heads.\nTake one bag of ammonium nitrate fertilizer & 1 gal of stove oil & dump a few bags of gravel on top & then set the shit off & will positivily ventalate any thing that should be in the way of the blast.\nThe death machine is all ready made. I would have sent you pictures but you would be nasty enough to trace them back to developer & then to me, so I shall describe my masterpiece to you. The nice part of it is all the parts can be bought on the open market with no questions asked.\n- 1 bat. pow clock—will run for aprox 1 year\n- 1 photoelectric switch\n- 2 copper leaf springs\n- 2 6V car bat\n- 1 flash light bulb & reflector\n- 1 mirror\n- 2 18\"\" cardboard tubes black with shoe polish in side & oute\nthe system checks out from one end to the other in my tests. What you do not know is whether the death machine is at the sight or whether it is being stored in my basement for future use. I think you do not have the manpower to stop this one by continually searching the road sides looking for this thing. & it wont do to re roat & re schedule the busses because the bomb can be adapted to new conditions.\nHave fun!!

RO to contact above-mentioned officers who will return to Vallejo if and when suspect contacted.\n\nOfficer's Name: Sgt. Mulanax Badge: 255 Division: Invest. Date of this report: 7-28-71 Time: 9 AM\nPage 3\nVALLEJO POLICE DEPARTMENT OFFICER'S REPORT concerning Zodiac Case No. 243 146\nIn past week RO has conducted a discreet background investigation on suspect Arthur Leigh Allen. Allen has an excellent reputation with neighbors living in the same block in which he resides. Mostly older people living in this neighborhood and most have known Allen since he was a small boy. No indication given to those persons contacted as to our reason for wishing information on suspect. It was ascertained Allen is presently employed by Union Oil of Calif. at their Pinole refinery. This is a summer job and it is his intention to return to school at the Fall semester at Sonoma State. He lives with his mother who is a widow. Father was a much decorated Commander, USN, retired. Father died approximately six months ago. Allen occupies basement apartment in his mother's home. Contrary to prior reports, neighbors state Allen is very devoted to his mother and she to him.\n\n11:30 AM Writer phoned Union Oil (799-4411) and spoke with Mr. McNamara, Personnel Department. Mr. McNamara confirmed the fact Allen was employed as a junior chemist in their lab. He works 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. He will be made available for interview by officers at any time during working hours. Private office will be provided for this purpose.

Mr. McNamara phoned the lab and requested Arthur Allen to come to his office. On Allen's arrival McNamara left. Prior to interviewing Allen it was decided the initial questioning of suspect would be conducted by Inspector Armstrong.\n\nAfter identifying ourselves as police officers, Allen was notified by Armstrong that we were investigating the Zodiac murders. He was further advised that it had been brought to our attention by an unnamed informant that Allen was alleged to have made certain statements approximately 11 months prior to the first Zodiac murder, which, if true, were of an incriminating nature. Allen was then informed by Armstrong of the conversation Allen had with Donald Cheney in January, 1968, but Allen was not told who this conversation was supposed to have been with. Allen was asked if he recalled having had such a conversation with anyone and replied that he did not recall such a conversation. He was asked if he had read or heard of the Zodiac and he replied he had read about Zodiac when it first appeared in the newspapers. He stated after the initial reading he did not follow it any longer as he thought it was \"\"too morbid\"\". Allen later made other statements which were in direct conflict with this prior statement.\n\nHe volunteered the information that he had been questioned as a suspect by a Vallejo police sergeant after the Berryessa murder in Napa County. He stated on this particular weekend he had gone to a place called Salt Point Ranch near Fort Ross skin diving.\n\nOfficer's Name: Sgt. Mulanax Badge: 255 Division: Invest.

He did not recall this person's name but had it written down somewhere at home. He returned to Vallejo at approximately 4:00 p.m. and recalls talking to a neighbor shortly after he drove into his driveway. Allen stated he had neglected to inform the Vallejo officer who had talked to him about being seen by this neighbor at the time he was questioned. This neighbor, named White, died approximately a week after he was questioned so he never bothered to recontact the police.\n\nWithout any questioning regarding a knife, Allen made the following statement: \"\"The two knives I had in my car with blood on them, the blood came from a chicken I had killed\"\". He evidently of the opinion we had some information regarding a knife that we did not possess.\n\nWriter researched VPD files and unable to locate any report where Allen had previously been questioned regarding being Zodiac suspect. Also contacted Sgt. Lynch and he does not recall having questioned Allen.\n\nAt a later point in interview Allen stated he had been in southern California at the approximate time as the Riverside murder in which Zodiac is a suspect. The information volunteered by Allen without prompting. He admitted to being interested in guns but claimed only hand guns he owned were 22 caliber.\n\nDuring interview it was noted Allen was wearing an unusual looking watch. The watch was shown officers by Allen and the brand name of watch was \"\"Zodiac\"\". Above the brand name was the circle and cross\nOfficer's Name: Sgt. Mulanax Badge: 255 Division: Invest.

Allen stated watch was given to him as a present from his mother approximately two years ago.\nAllen expressed his willingness to assist investigators in any manner possible. Stated he wished the time would come when police officers were no longer referred to as \"\"Pigs\"\". Prior to terminating interview writer asked Allen if he could recall anyone whom he might have had a conversation with regarding Zodiac. He stated he might have had a conversation with Mr. Kidder or Mr. Tucker of the Vallejo Recreation Department while he was employed there, but he was not positive.\n\nAllen also related having read a book in high school which made a lasting impression on him. He stated the title of the book was \"\"The Most Dangerous Game\"\". This book was made into a movie and concerns a man shipwrecked on an island and being hunted by another man \"\"like an animal\"\". In conversation with Cheney, Allen is alleged to have disuussed this story.\n\nAfter interview with Allen, it was opinion of all three investigators that further investigation should be conducted.\n\nOfficer's Name: Sgt.

Mr. Kidder was asked if he knew Arthur Allen and if he recalled ever having discussed the Zodiac case with him. Kidder stated to his knowledge he had never talked about the Zodiac with Allen. Allen was formerly employed by the Recreation District as a life guard and trampoline instructor. His employment had been terminated approximately five years ago because of Allen's association with small children. Mr. Kidder had received numerous complaints from concerned parents of various acts towards their children by Allen. No formal complaint was ever made to the police re-Allen's acts. Kidder further remarked that as recently as three weeks ago he had a discussion with Philip Tucker, General Supervisor, Recreation District, concerning Allen as being a suspect in Zodiac murders. This discussion came about primarily because of Allen's suspected possibility of being a sexual deviate towards children and physical description. Both parties considered him a \"\"loner\"\" type.\n\nPhilip Tucker was called to Mr. Kidder's office and questioned about any conversations he might have had with Allen concerning Zodiac. He recalled casual type conversations and on one such occasion Allen told him that he had been questioned by police as a suspect. Tucker remembered Allen having discussed a special light attached to a gun barrel so that a person could shoot accurately at night. On another occasion he and his wife had visited Allen in his home. Allen had\n\nOfficer's Name: Sgt. Mulanax Badge: 255 Division: Invest.

He then took from a grey metal box, located in his bedroom, a paper. This paper was hand printed and pertained to a person who had been committed to Atascadero State Hospital for molesting a child. It rambled on and on about this person having been betrayed by his attorney, using language of a legal nature or terminology. Also in this script were various symbols similar to those used by Zodiac in his coded messages. Symbols and code very neatly done. Tucker expressed a polite interest in paper but his wife showed genuine interest. She asked Allen if she might borrow the paper to study it but Allen refused to allow her to take the paper. He did promise to have a copy made to give her. This he never did.\n\nTucker was asked if, to his knowledge, Allen had an interest in guns. He stated that he did have and owned two hand guns, one a revolver and the other some type of automatic. He did not know the calibers and admitted he did not have abundant knowledge of guns himself. When Allen was questioned he did not admit owning or having owned an automatic weapon.\n\nAlso when Allen was questioned RO asked him if he had ever owned a 1965-66 brown Corvair. He replied in the negative. This the type of car described by survivor of Blue Rock Springs murder as being driven by responsible on night of Ferrin murder July 4, 1969. Tucker was asked if he had any knowledge of Allen ever having owned such a car.\n\nOfficer's Name: Sgt. Mulanax Badge: 255 Division: Invest. Date of this report: 8-10-71 Time: 4 PM\nPage 9\nVALLEJO POLICE DEPARTMENT OFFICER'S REPORT concerning Zodiac Case No. 243 146\nHe stated that to his knowledge he had not, but that he, Tucker, had owned a brown 1964 Corvair. When asked if he had ever loaned this vehicle to Allen, Tucker stated he had not. At the time he had two cars, the Corvair and a Pontiac, Allen had used his Pontiac on occasion. At this particular time Tucker was living in Berkeley. In the summer of 1969 he had left the Corvair parked at the Richfield Service station at Nebraska and Broadway for a period of approximately two weeks in an attempt to sell it. Keys were left at the station. At this time Arthur Allen was employed at this service station as an attendant. The exact time car was left could not be recalled by Mr. Tucker other than it was mid-summer of 1969.\n\nTucker further stated that approximately three weeks prior he had been contacted by Karen Allen, sister-in-law of suspect, and requested to contact Allen re-seeking some type of psychiatric treatment. This was because of some recent involvement with a child that the family had received a complaint about. He stated he did talk to Allen in his home but apparently could not get through to him he needed help. Conversation ended by Tucker requesting Allen not to come around his home in the future and that their association had come to an end.\n\nOfficers unable to contact Mrs. Tucker re-what she might have recalled about the script she had seen at Allen's home on prior mentioned occasion as she works graveyard shift in an Oakland hospital. She will be contacted at a later date.\n\nOfficer's Name: Sgt. Mulanax Badge: 255 Division: Invest.

On arrival she was advised as to the reasons we wished to talk to her and seemed surprised that Arthur Allen was suspected as possibly being the Zodiac. Mrs. Allen promised her assistance in any manner possible. She stated she and her husband were aware that Allen had some type of hangup regarding children but that she could not believe he could be Zodiac. Mrs. Allen stated Arthur hated women, had never had a serious relationship with a woman his own age. He resented her and had made threats against her as he thought she had come between him and her husband. According to Karen, Arthur was spoiled and pampered by his mother. Mother did his cooking, washed his clothes, cleaned up after him and gave him money. Mother paid for two automobiles and two boats. She further stated Arthur hated his mother and had often expressed this hatred in her presence.\n\nKaren was shown various notes written by Zodiac to the newspapers. She could not recognize printing as being similar to suspect's but did relate that certain phrases were of the context that he would use. As an example, she stated he would use the phrase \"\"trigger mach\"\" instead of trigger mechanism. When she saw the Christmas card addressed to Melvin Belli spelled \"\"Mery Xmass\"\" Karen stated she definitely recalled having received a card at Christmas from Arthur in which Merry Xmas was spelled exactly the same way.\n\nKaren stated Allen was left-handed, but when he was in school his teachers had attempted to convert him to right hand. He learned to write right-handed but soon reverted back to using his left hand.\n\nOfficer's Name: Sgt. Mulanax Badge: 255 Division: Invest.

Her husband, Ronald, is WMA, 32, landscape engineer. Appointment made to come to her home at 8:00 p.m. this date & discuss matter with her husband.\n\n8:15 PM Inspectors Armstrong and Toschi and RO to 216 Aragon Street. Ron Allen promised all assistance possible in investigation but could not believe his brother could be a serious suspect in this case. Ron apparently had a sincere desire to assist but could offer little to either confirm or clear matter under investigation. He did say that he was well acquainted with our sources of information who had originally given statements to police indicating Arthur Leigh Allen was a prime suspect. Ron Allen stated they were responsible people who would not have made such statements if they were not true. He further stated that he had received a complaint from Cheney that his brother had made improper advances toward one of his children. This might be a motive why Cheney would make such an accusation against Arthur Allen. This is RO's observation and not Ronald Allen's.\n\n\nRonald had no knowledge of any notes possessed by his brother such as described by Tucker. He did have knowledge of a grey metal box in his brother's bedroom. Stated as far as he knew his brother owned two guns, both 22 caliber revolvers. Also of the opinion brother drank to excess and had a definite problem as far as children were concerned. Ronald stated if he could develop anything which might assist in investigation he would contact RO.\n\nOfficer's Name: Sgt. Mulanax Badge: 255 Division: Invest.

Mr. Luce was informed we were conducting an investigation on a former employee but not informed as to what. He stated Allen had been employed by him on a part-time basis for approximately six months. He was undependable and had a drinking problem. Again the subject of children came up. He seemed to be too interested in small girls. After several warnings regarding Allen coming to work under the influence of intoxicants or of not showing up as scheduled, Luce terminated his employment. Work records show he was discharged in April 1969. Luce recalls Tucker having his car at his service station, but he does not think it was for a two-week period. In any event, this would seem to negate the possibility Allen could have used this particular car on July 4, 1969 as he was no longer employed by Luce and no one can recall the exact date vehicle was left at station.\n\nOfficer's Name: Sgt.

Mrs. Tucker was questioned regarding the papers shown her by Allen which contained some type of code. She related substantially the same story as her husband had given. At the time she was shown the writings she was preparing for an examination in college in psychology and admitted that she was very interested in contents of letters. Allen had explained he had received these papers from a patient at Atascadero and Mrs. Tucker's interest was primarily directed towards the working of this person's mind. The exactness and neatness of the printing and of the symbols used made an impression on her. She was shown photostatic copies of some of the codes sent by Zodiac. She identified numerous symbols used in Zodiac code as being the same as she saw in the papers shown her by Allen. It was her recollection these papers were drawn with a felt-point pen.\n\n5:30 PM Mr. Tucker arrived home from work. He was also shown the Zodiac codes and also stated they appeared the same as those shown him by Allen. Mr. Tucker was questioned further regarding when he left his 1964 Corvair at the service station, 640 Broadway, where Allen was employed. He could not recall the date. He did state that after this time when the car was not sold he had left it parked in front of his father-in-law's home for a considerable period of time. It is possible that Allen could have driven car during this period but\n\nOfficer's Name: Sgt. Mulanax Badge: 255 Division: Invest.

In-laws are in Europe at present time and on return he will ask them if they have any knowledge of Allen using the car during this period. In-laws knew Allen as a friend of Tucker's.\n\nTucker stated Allen was, in his opinion, a schizophrenic personality. He is an avid reader of science fiction literature and at times seems to live what he has read. He can tell a lie and actually believe what he is telling. Tucker again related Allen's apparent and expressed hatred for women.\n\n\nOfficer's Name: Sgt. Mulanax Badge: 255 Division: Invest.

Date of this report: 7-28-71 Time: 9 AM\nPage 3\nVALLEJO POLICE DEPARTMENT OFFICER'S REPORT concerning Zodiac Case No. 243 146\nIn past week RO has conducted a discreet background investigation on suspect Arthur Leigh Allen. Allen has an excellent reputation with neighbors living in the same block in which he resides. Mostly older people living in this neighborhood and most have known Allen since he was a small boy. No indication given to those persons contacted as to our reason for wishing information on suspect. It was ascertained Allen is presently employed by Union Oil of Calif. at their Pinole refinery. This is a summer job and it is his intention to return to school at the Fall semester at Sonoma State. He lives with his mother who is a widow. Father was a much decorated Commander, USN, retired.

Mr. McNamara phoned the lab and requested Arthur Allen to come to his office. On Allen's arrival McNamara left. Prior to interviewing Allen it was decided the initial questioning of suspect would be conducted by Inspector Armstrong.\n\nAfter identifying ourselves as police officers, Allen was notified by Armstrong that we were investigating the Zodiac murders. He was further advised that it had been brought to our attention by an unnamed informant that Allen was alleged to have made certain statements approximately 11 months prior to the first Zodiac murder, which, if true, were of an incriminating nature. Allen was then informed by Armstrong of the conversation Allen had with Donald Cheney in January, 1968, but Allen was not told who this conversation was supposed to have been with. Allen was asked if he recalled having had such a conversation with anyone and replied that he did not recall such a conversation. He was asked if he had read or heard of the Zodiac and he replied he had read about Zodiac when it first appeared in the newspapers. He stated after the initial reading he did not follow it any longer as he thought it was \"\"too morbid\"\". Allen later made other statements which were in direct conflict with this prior statement.\n\nHe volunteered the information that he had been questioned as a suspect by a Vallejo police sergeant after the Berryessa murder in Napa County. He stated on this particular weekend he had gone to a place called Salt Point Ranch near Fort Ross skin diving.\n\nOfficer's Name: Sgt. Mulanax Badge: 255 Division: Invest.

He did not recall this person's name but had it written down somewhere at home. He returned to Vallejo at approximately 4:00 p.m. and recalls talking to a neighbor shortly after he drove into his driveway. Allen stated he had neglected to inform the Vallejo officer who had talked to him about being seen by this neighbor at the time he was questioned. This neighbor, named White, died approximately a week after he was questioned so he never bothered to recontact the police.\n\nWithout any questioning regarding a knife, Allen made the following statement: \"\"The two knives I had in my car with blood on them, the blood came from a chicken I had killed\"\". He evidently of the opinion we had some information regarding a knife that we did not possess.\n\nWriter researched VPD files and unable to locate any report where Allen had previously been questioned regarding being Zodiac suspect. Also contacted Sgt. Lynch and he does not recall having questioned Allen.\n\nAt a later point in interview Allen stated he had been in southern California at the approximate time as the Riverside murder in which Zodiac is a suspect.

He admitted to being interested in guns but claimed only hand guns he owned were 22 caliber.\n\nDuring interview it was noted Allen was wearing an unusual looking watch. The watch was shown officers by Allen and the brand name of watch was \"\"Zodiac\"\". Above the brand name was the circle and cross\nOfficer's Name: Sgt. Mulanax Badge: 255 Division: Invest.

Allen stated watch was given to him as a present from his mother approximately two years ago.\nAllen expressed his willingness to assist investigators in any manner possible. Stated he wished the time would come when police officers were no longer referred to as \"\"Pigs\"\". Prior to terminating interview writer asked Allen if he could recall anyone whom he might have had a conversation with regarding Zodiac. He stated he might have had a conversation with Mr. Kidder or Mr. Tucker of the Vallejo Recreation Department while he was employed there, but he was not positive.\n\nAllen also related having read a book in high school which made a lasting impression on him. He stated the title of the book was \"\"The Most Dangerous Game\"\". This book was made into a movie and concerns a man shipwrecked on an island and being hunted by another man \"\"like an animal\"\". In conversation with Cheney, Allen is alleged to have disuussed this story.\n\nAfter interview with Allen, it was opinion of all three investigators that further investigation should be conducted.\n\nOfficer's Name: Sgt.

Mr. Kidder was asked if he knew Arthur Allen and if he recalled ever having discussed the Zodiac case with him. Kidder stated to his knowledge he had never talked about the Zodiac with Allen. Allen was formerly employed by the Recreation District as a life guard and trampoline instructor. His employment had been terminated approximately five years ago because of Allen's association with small children. Mr. Kidder had received numerous complaints from concerned parents of various acts towards their children by Allen. No formal complaint was ever made to the police re-Allen's acts. Kidder further remarked that as recently as three weeks ago he had a discussion with Philip Tucker, General Supervisor, Recreation District, concerning Allen as being a suspect in Zodiac murders. This discussion came about primarily because of Allen's suspected possibility of being a sexual deviate towards children and physical description. Both parties considered him a \"\"loner\"\" type.\n\nPhilip Tucker was called to Mr. Kidder's office and questioned about any conversations he might have had with Allen concerning Zodiac. He recalled casual type conversations and on one such occasion Allen told him that he had been questioned by police as a suspect.

He then took from a grey metal box, located in his bedroom, a paper. This paper was hand printed and pertained to a person who had been committed to Atascadero State Hospital for molesting a child. It rambled on and on about this person having been betrayed by his attorney, using language of a legal nature or terminology. Also in this script were various symbols similar to those used by Zodiac in his coded messages. Symbols and code very neatly done. Tucker expressed a polite interest in paper but his wife showed genuine interest. She asked Allen if she might borrow the paper to study it but Allen refused to allow her to take the paper. He did promise to have a copy made to give her. This he never did.\n\nTucker was asked if, to his knowledge, Allen had an interest in guns. He stated that he did have and owned two hand guns, one a revolver and the other some type of automatic. He did not know the calibers and admitted he did not have abundant knowledge of guns himself. When Allen was questioned he did not admit owning or having owned an automatic weapon.\n\nAlso when Allen was questioned RO asked him if he had ever owned a 1965-66 brown Corvair. He replied in the negative. This the type of car described by survivor of Blue Rock Springs murder as being driven by responsible on night of Ferrin murder July 4, 1969.

When asked if he had ever loaned this vehicle to Allen, Tucker stated he had not. At the time he had two cars, the Corvair and a Pontiac, Allen had used his Pontiac on occasion. At this particular time Tucker was living in Berkeley. In the summer of 1969 he had left the Corvair parked at the Richfield Service station at Nebraska and Broadway for a period of approximately two weeks in an attempt to sell it. Keys were left at the station. At this time Arthur Allen was employed at this service station as an attendant. The exact time car was left could not be recalled by Mr. Tucker other than it was mid-summer of 1969.\n\nTucker further stated that approximately three weeks prior he had been contacted by Karen Allen, sister-in-law of suspect, and requested to contact Allen re-seeking some type of psychiatric treatment. This was because of some recent involvement with a child that the family had received a complaint about. He stated he did talk to Allen in his home but apparently could not get through to him he needed help. Conversation ended by Tucker requesting Allen not to come around his home in the future and that their association had come to an end.\n\nOfficers unable to contact Mrs. Tucker re-what she might have recalled about the script she had seen at Allen's home on prior mentioned occasion as she works graveyard shift in an Oakland hospital.

On arrival she was advised as to the reasons we wished to talk to her and seemed surprised that Arthur Allen was suspected as possibly being the Zodiac. Mrs. Allen promised her assistance in any manner possible. She stated she and her husband were aware that Allen had some type of hangup regarding children but that she could not believe he could be Zodiac. Mrs. Allen stated Arthur hated women, had never had a serious relationship with a woman his own age. He resented her and had made threats against her as he thought she had come between him and her husband. According to Karen, Arthur was spoiled and pampered by his mother. Mother did his cooking, washed his clothes, cleaned up after him and gave him money. Mother paid for two automobiles and two boats. She further stated Arthur hated his mother and had often expressed this hatred in her presence.\n\nKaren was shown various notes written by Zodiac to the newspapers. She could not recognize printing as being similar to suspect's but did relate that certain phrases were of the context that he would use. As an example, she stated he would use the phrase \"\"trigger mach\"\" instead of trigger mechanism. When she saw the Christmas card addressed to Melvin Belli spelled \"\"Mery Xmass\"\" Karen stated she definitely recalled having received a card at Christmas from Arthur in which Merry Xmas was spelled exactly the same way.\n\nKaren stated Allen was left-handed, but when he was in school his teachers had attempted to convert him to right hand. He learned to write right-handed but soon reverted back to using his left hand.\n\nOfficer's Name: Sgt. Mulanax Badge: 255 Division: Invest. Date of this report: 8-11-71 Time: 10 AM\nPage 11\nVALLEJO POLICE DEPARTMENT OFFICER'S REPORT concerning Zodiac Case No. 243 146\nKaren Allen is a WFA, 26, formerly taught school. Her husband, Ronald, is WMA, 32, landscape engineer. Appointment made to come to her home at 8:00 p.m. this date & discuss matter with her husband.\n\n8:15 PM Inspectors Armstrong and Toschi and RO to 216 Aragon Street. Ron Allen promised all assistance possible in investigation but could not believe his brother could be a serious suspect in this case. Ron apparently had a sincere desire to assist but could offer little to either confirm or clear matter under investigation. He did say that he was well acquainted with our sources of information who had originally given statements to police indicating Arthur Leigh Allen was a prime suspect. Ron Allen stated they were responsible people who would not have made such statements if they were not true. He further stated that he had received a complaint from Cheney that his brother had made improper advances toward one of his children. This might be a motive why Cheney would make such an accusation against Arthur Allen. This is RO's observation and not Ronald Allen's.\n\n\nRonald had no knowledge of any notes possessed by his brother such as described by Tucker. He did have knowledge of a grey metal box in his brother's bedroom. Stated as far as he knew his brother owned two guns, both 22 caliber revolvers. Also of the opinion brother drank to excess and had a definite problem as far as children were concerned. Ronald stated if he could develop anything which might assist in investigation he would contact RO.\n\nOfficer's Name: Sgt. Mulanax Badge: 255 Division: Invest. Date of this report: 8-11-71 Time: 10 AM\nPage 12\nVALLEJO POLICE DEPARTMENT OFFICER'S REPORT concerning Zodiac Case No. 243 146\n8-11-71 11:00 AM RO contacted Bob Luce, owner-operator of the Arco Service Station, 640 Broadway. Mr. Luce was informed we were conducting an investigation on a former employee but not informed as to what. He stated Allen had been employed by him on a part-time basis for approximately six months. He was undependable and had a drinking problem. Again the subject of children came up. He seemed to be too interested in small girls. After several warnings regarding Allen coming to work under the influence of intoxicants or of not showing up as scheduled, Luce terminated his employment. Work records show he was discharged in April 1969. Luce recalls Tucker having his car at his service station, but he does not think it was for a two-week period. In any event, this would seem to negate the possibility Allen could have used this particular car on July 4, 1969 as he was no longer employed by Luce and no one can recall the exact date vehicle was left at station.\n\nOfficer's Name: Sgt.

Mrs. Tucker was questioned regarding the papers shown her by Allen which contained some type of code. She related substantially the same story as her husband had given. At the time she was shown the writings she was preparing for an examination in college in psychology and admitted that she was very interested in contents of letters. Allen had explained he had received these papers from a patient at Atascadero and Mrs. Tucker's interest was primarily directed towards the working of this person's mind. The exactness and neatness of the printing and of the symbols used made an impression on her. She was shown photostatic copies of some of the codes sent by Zodiac. She identified numerous symbols used in Zodiac code as being the same as she saw in the papers shown her by Allen. It was her recollection these papers were drawn with a felt-point pen.\n\n5:30 PM Mr. Tucker arrived home from work. He was also shown the Zodiac codes and also stated they appeared the same as those shown him by Allen. Mr. Tucker was questioned further regarding when he left his 1964 Corvair at the service station, 640 Broadway, where Allen was employed. He could not recall the date. He did state that after this time when the car was not sold he had left it parked in front of his father-in-law's home for a considerable period of time. It is possible that Allen could have driven car during this period but\n\nOfficer's Name: Sgt. Mulanax Badge: 255 Division: Invest. Date of this report: 8-12-71 Time: 9 AM\nPage 14\nVALLEJO POLICE DEPARTMENT OFFICER'S REPORT concerning Zodiac Case No. 243 146\nhe has no knowledge that he in fact did. In-laws are in Europe at present time and on return he will ask them if they have any knowledge of Allen using the car during this period. In-laws knew Allen as a friend of Tucker's.\n\nTucker stated Allen was, in his opinion, a schizophrenic personality. He is an avid reader of science fiction literature and at times seems to live what he has read. He can tell a lie and actually believe what he is telling. Tucker again related Allen's apparent and expressed hatred for women.\n\n\nOfficer's Name: Sgt. Mulanax Badge: 255 Division: Invest.

Charles J. McNatt, P.D.\n Suspect: See body of report\nCOMPLETE DETAILS OF CRIME AND DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY\nThis investigation is being conducted by Sergeant Charles J. McNatt, Patterson Police Department. In an attempt to evaluate the circumstances surrounding the alleged kidnapping of Mrs. Kathleen Johns, 617 Campus Way, San Bernardino, California, and her 10-month-old daughter Jennifer, on Interstate 5, north of Patterson at about 2315 hours, 3/22/70.\nOn the morning of 23 March 1970, at about 0230 hours, Mrs. Kathleen Johns was brought to the Patterson Police Department in a hysterical condition. When Mrs. Johns was quieted it was learned from her that a car had followed her from Modesto on Highway 132, and began blinking the lights in an attempt to get her to stop which she refused to do. Mrs. Johns states that after she had entered Interstate 5 that the vehicle then passed her, and at this time she stopped to check her car and was flagged to the wrong side of the road by a male subject who had been following her, had stopped, and had backed up the freeway. The man got out and advised her that the wheel on her car was wobbling and that he would fix it for her, that he began to take off a tire wrench and appeared to be tightening the lug bolts on her left rear wheel. The man then got into his own car and drove off without saying anything. Mrs. Johns then got into her own car and as she started driving off the wheel came off her car, whereupon the subject came back and said he would drive her to a service station. Mrs. Johns then got her infant into the car with the subject and he drove her around for what seemed to be an hour and a half or more, driving on back roads and stopping and turning around several times. She said he kept mumbling about killing people and throwing their bodies out of cars, and that he told her he was going to kill her and throw her baby out after he did so.\nShe said nothing during the ride and that at one point she attempted to get away, and he said if she did he would kill her. After driving around for some time the suspect’s car stopped at an intersection and Mrs. Johns grabbed her baby and ran across a field, hiding in a ditch until she saw the suspect drive off. She then walked or hitchhiked approximately two miles to the nearest road where she was picked up by a passing motorist and brought to the Patterson Police Department.\nMrs. Johns described the suspect as a white male, approximately 30 years old, 5'9\"\" in height, 160 lbs., dark hair, dark complexion, wearing a dark windbreaker jacket and black slacks. She stated she could identify him if seen again.\nMrs. Johns described the suspect’s car as a late-model tan or light brown sedan, possibly a 1957 or 1958 Chevrolet, with a spotlight on the left front fender. She stated there were no license plates on the front or rear of the vehicle.\nInvestigation revealed that Mrs. Johns’ vehicle, a brown 1957 Chevrolet station wagon, had been located burned approximately two miles west of Interstate 5 and one mile north of Highway 132. The vehicle was completely destroyed by fire, with the lug bolts on the left rear wheel missing. Deputy Lovett of the San Joaquin County Sheriff’s Office stated that a preliminary investigation showed the fire to be of incendiary origin.\nMrs. Johns and her infant daughter were taken to the San Joaquin General Hospital for observation and later released.\nInspector Tyrell of the San Joaquin County Sheriff’s Office and the San Francisco Police Department were contacted regarding the possibility of this case being connected with the so-called “Zodiac” suspect who has been operating in Northern California. Inspector Tyrell asked that a full report be sent to his office.\nDEPARTMENT OF POLICE — CITY OF PATTERSON\n P.O. Box 667 — Patterson, Ca. 95363\n Alex X. Kosch — Chief of Police\n Phone (209) 892-2031\nBy this department it was found that this was the first time the initial report from Mrs. Johns and that the report was to be sent to the Homicide Division, attention Inspector Armstrong and Inspector Toschi.\nWhen this office made contact with Inspector Tyrell no names were mentioned, only the bulletin number and SFPD case number was used.\nBurned vehicle was towed to Tracy on authority of the San Joaquin authorities who state that arson and kidnapping charges will be filed if and when the person is arrested.\nCharles J.

This incident occurred on Highway 132 near Interstate 5 outside Patterson, California, approximately 72 miles east-southeast of Vallejo.\n## The Abduction\nAccording to Johns' report to the Patterson Police Department, she was driving from San Bernardino to Petaluma to visit her sick mother when a vehicle began following her, flashing its lights. After she pulled over, a man approached her car claiming her wheel was wobbling. He offered to tighten the lug bolts on her left rear wheel. After appearing to fix the problem, Johns attempted to drive away but discovered the wheel immediately fell off, secured by only one bolt.\nThe man then offered to drive Johns and her infant daughter to a service station. Once they entered his vehicle, however, he drove them around on back roads for approximately 1.5 hours. During this time, according to Johns' statement, the man mumbled about \"\"killing people and throwing their bodies out of cars\"\" and threatened to kill her and throw her baby out afterward.\n## The Escape\nWhen the vehicle stopped at an intersection, Johns seized the opportunity to escape. She grabbed her daughter and fled across a field, hiding in a ditch until she saw the suspect drive away. She then walked or hitchhiked approximately two miles to the nearest road where a passing motorist picked her up and brought her to the Patterson Police Department at around 2:30 AM.\n## Police Investigation\nSergeant Charles J. McNatt of the Patterson Police Department documented Johns' arrival in a \"\"hysterical condition.\"\" Johns described her abductor as a white male, approximately 30 years old, 5'9\"\" tall, 160 pounds, with dark hair and complexion, wearing a dark windbreaker jacket and black slacks. She stated she could identify him if seen again.\nJohns' vehicle, a brown 1957 Chevrolet station wagon, was later found completely destroyed by fire approximately two miles west of Interstate 5 and one mile north of Highway 132. Investigation revealed the lug bolts on the left rear wheel were missing, and the fire appeared to be of incendiary origin.\n## Connection to the Zodiac Killer\nWhile at the police station, Johns reportedly noticed a wanted poster with a composite sketch of the Zodiac Killer and identified him as her abductor. The San Francisco Police Department was contacted regarding the possible connection to the Zodiac case.\nOn July 24, 1970, the Zodiac Killer sent a letter to the San Francisco Chronicle in which he claimed responsibility for the incident, writing that he had \"\"a little list\"\" of victims which included \"\"the woman + her baby that I gave a rather interesting ride for a coupple howers one evening a few months back that ended in my burning her car where I found them.\"\"\n## Perspectives on the Case\nThe connection between Johns' abduction and the Zodiac Killer remains debated among investigators:\n- **Supporting evidence**: The Zodiac's own claim of responsibility in his July 24 letter; Johns' identification of the composite sketch; the proximity to other Zodiac activity; and the threatening behavior consistent with the Zodiac's pattern.\n- **Skeptical view**: Some investigators question the reliability of Johns' identification and note inconsistencies in her account. The location was also farther east than the Zodiac's confirmed attacks, which were concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nThe Kathleen Johns incident remains one of the most significant potential Zodiac encounters where the victim survived to provide a detailed account. Johns died of a heart attack in 2002, and the case continues to be studied as part of the broader Zodiac investigation.\n\",,\"recqcpvWj2OVS3S1w,recGZwp9mtC6qB9Hd\",https://zodiackillerfacts.com/kathleen-johns/police-reports/,\"Patterson_Police_Dept_1.jpg (data/media/atto4ooSjaej5tyh1_Patterson_Police_Dept_1.jpg),Patterson_Police_Dept_2.jpg (data/media/attlXe9QGUe6QIio2_Patterson_Police_Dept_2.jpg),Stanislaus_Sheriff_s_Dept_1.jpg (data/media/att6tsG3W4pK3CCc2_Stanislaus_Sheriff_s_Dept_1.jpg),San_Joaquin_Sheriff_Report_1.jpg (data/media/attqj1Q5fc9lddW6z_San_Joaquin_Sheriff_Report_1.jpg),San_Joaquin_Sheriff_Report_6.jpg (data/media/attMbrRlEbTzS16cr_San_Joaquin_Sheriff_Report_6.jpg),San_Joaquin_Sheriff_Report_5.jpg (data/media/attmumkmeIFN802dS_San_Joaquin_Sheriff_Report_5.jpg),San_Joaquin_Sheriff_Report_4.jpg (data/media/attRW4AwOlzdy3RhT_San_Joaquin_Sheriff_Report_4.jpg),San_Joaquin_Sheriff_Report_3.jpg (data/media/attDZZisBJ1ijtjsj_San_Joaquin_Sheriff_Report_3.jpg),San_Joaquin_Sheriff_Report_2.jpg (data/media/attbqmVmHA87fv8jR_San_Joaquin_Sheriff_Report_2.jpg)\",recBM8GSgFG8sgfDe,\"recoGGiZHd07WTfpM,recOWlJ4skc4bB7Aw,recS5nE6f2S4s6GGH\",,1970,March,Sunday,,Disputed Z Crime,1970-03-22T23:15:00.000Z,3/22/1970 11:15PM,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=The%20Kathleen%20Johns%20incident&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=The%20Kathleen%20Johns%20incident&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,\"reczqLUi2H586yt4a,recdJsGIoKWHvgjq5\",2025-09-05T22:16:41.000Z,11:15 PM,,1970-03-22T23:15:00.000Z,,\"Title: Patterson Police Department on Kathleen Johns Incident\n\nDate: 1970-03-23T00:00:00.000Z\n\nAuthor / Source: Kathleen Johns\n\nOrigin / Postmark: \"\"Patterson, CA\"\"\n\nEvents: The Kathleen Johns incident, The Johns Letter, Kathleen Johns reports incident to Patterson Police Dept.\n\nRelated People / Groups: Kathleen Johns\n\nTags: \n\nLocations: \n\nSource: zodiackillerfacts.com\n\nText: PATTERSON POLICE\n PATTERSON, CALIF.\nPatterson Police Department — Reporting Dept.\n Code: 207 PC (Assist other agency)\n Classification of Crime: Kidnapping\n F.F.D.

McNatt, Patterson Police Department. In an attempt to evaluate the circumstances surrounding the alleged kidnapping of Mrs. Kathleen Johns, 617 Campus Way, San Bernardino, California, and her 10-month-old daughter Jennifer, on Interstate 5, north of Patterson at about 2315 hours, 3/22/70.\nOn the morning of 23 March 1970, at about 0230 hours, Mrs. Kathleen Johns was brought to the Patterson Police Department in a hysterical condition. When Mrs. Johns was quieted it was learned from her that a car had followed her from Modesto on Highway 132, and began blinking the lights in an attempt to get her to stop which she refused to do. Mrs. Johns states that after she had entered Interstate 5 that the vehicle then passed her, and at this time she stopped to check her car and was flagged to the wrong side of the road by a male subject who had been following her, had stopped, and had backed up the freeway. The man got out and advised her that the wheel on her car was wobbling and that he would fix it for her, that he began to take off a tire wrench and appeared to be tightening the lug bolts on her left rear wheel. The man then got into his own car and drove off without saying anything. Mrs. Johns then got into her own car and as she started driving off the wheel came off her car, whereupon the subject came back and said he would drive her to a service station. Mrs. Johns then got her infant into the car with the subject and he drove her around for what seemed to be an hour and a half or more, driving on back roads and stopping and turning around several times. She said he kept mumbling about killing people and throwing their bodies out of cars, and that he told her he was going to kill her and throw her baby out after he did so.\nShe said nothing during the ride and that at one point she attempted to get away, and he said if she did he would kill her. After driving around for some time the suspect’s car stopped at an intersection and Mrs. Johns grabbed her baby and ran across a field, hiding in a ditch until she saw the suspect drive off. She then walked or hitchhiked approximately two miles to the nearest road where she was picked up by a passing motorist and brought to the Patterson Police Department.\nMrs. Johns described the suspect as a white male, approximately 30 years old, 5'9\"\" in height, 160 lbs., dark hair, dark complexion, wearing a dark windbreaker jacket and black slacks. She stated she could identify him if seen again.\nMrs. Johns described the suspect’s car as a late-model tan or light brown sedan, possibly a 1957 or 1958 Chevrolet, with a spotlight on the left front fender. She stated there were no license plates on the front or rear of the vehicle.\nInvestigation revealed that Mrs. Johns’ vehicle, a brown 1957 Chevrolet station wagon, had been located burned approximately two miles west of Interstate 5 and one mile north of Highway 132. The vehicle was completely destroyed by fire, with the lug bolts on the left rear wheel missing. Deputy Lovett of the San Joaquin County Sheriff’s Office stated that a preliminary investigation showed the fire to be of incendiary origin.\nMrs. Johns and her infant daughter were taken to the San Joaquin General Hospital for observation and later released.\nInspector Tyrell of the San Joaquin County Sheriff’s Office and the San Francisco Police Department were contacted regarding the possibility of this case being connected with the so-called “Zodiac” suspect who has been operating in Northern California. Inspector Tyrell asked that a full report be sent to his office.\nDEPARTMENT OF POLICE — CITY OF PATTERSON\n P.O. Box 667 — Patterson, Ca. 95363\n Alex X. Kosch — Chief of Police\n Phone (209) 892-2031\nBy this department it was found that this was the first time the initial report from Mrs. Johns and that the report was to be sent to the Homicide Division, attention Inspector Armstrong and Inspector Toschi.\nWhen this office made contact with Inspector Tyrell no names were mentioned, only the bulletin number and SFPD case number was used.\nBurned vehicle was towed to Tracy on authority of the San Joaquin authorities who state that arson and kidnapping charges will be filed if and when the person is arrested.\nCharles J.

Arrived at the Patterson PD at 2:50 AM.\nContacted the complainant who stated at approx. 11:15 PM, 3-22-70 she had been driving on Hwy. 132 near Interstate 5 when she observed a late model vehicle, light tan in color, no other description, following her and blinking its lights as if the operator of the vehicle desired the complainant to stop. Complainant stated she stopped her vehicle, a 1957 Chevrolet S/W bearing Calif. Lic. HOU 518, somewhere in the area of Hwy. 132 and Interstate 5. She advised that the exact area is unfamiliar to her and that she was not sure where the vehicle had been stopped.\nComplainant stated that a WMA, approx. 30 yrs., 5’9”, 160 lbs., dark hair, wearing blk. rimmed plastic glasses, wearing a dark jacket and dark trousers, blue bell-bottomed pants, approached her vehicle and advised her that her left rear wheel of her vehicle was wobbling and that he would repair the malfunction. Complainant stated she stayed in her vehicle and observed the suspect tighten the lug nuts of the rear tire of her vehicle and upon completion then advised her the wheel was okay at this time and that she could proceed. The complainant then observed the suspect pull away from the roadway and across the area.\nComplainant stated she started her vehicle and was attempting to pull away from the curb when the vehicle came to a lurching stop at which time she exited the vehicle in an attempt to ascertain what the problem was. She discovered that the left rear wheel had fallen off the vehicle and it had only been secured by one lug bolt. She stated at that time she observed the suspect return in his vehicle and he advised her he would transport her to a service station in order to have the vehicle repaired. The complainant entered the suspect’s vehicle carrying her small daughter, approx. 10 mos., and left the area under the pretense that the suspect was attempting to locate a service station.\nComplainant stated the suspect drove around in the County area, possibly near Tracy, for approx. one and a half hours and would not allow her to leave his vehicle. She stated at one time he said, “I’m going to kill you and throw your baby out after you.” Complainant stated that beyond that, the suspect made no sexual advances toward her and merely eluded the question of stating anything further.\nShe was quite frightened, feeling that possibly the suspect intended to do some physical injury to her and that when the suspect stopped at a stop sign, she grabbed her daughter and ran away from the car into the fields and hid until she saw a passing motorist, who transported her to the Patterson Police Department.\nComplainant stated the suspect’s vehicle was light tan in color, possibly a 1957 or 1958 Chevrolet, with one spotlight on the left front fender, and there were no license plates on the vehicle.\nThe person transporting the complainant were not present upon this writer’s arrival, therefore their names remain unknown at this time.\nComplainant advised that she was not injured during the incident, nor her daughter had not been harmed.\nInvestigating Officer: Lovett #160\n Supervisor: Odelance #22\n Follow-up Officer: FRED WOODS\n Date: MAR 23 1970\n,Title: San Joaquin Sheriff's Department report on Kathleen Johns incident\n\nDate: 1970-03-23T00:00:00.000Z\n\nAuthor / Source: Kathleen Johns\n\nOrigin / Postmark: \n\nEvents: The Kathleen Johns incident\n\nRelated People / Groups: \n\nTags: \n\nLocations: \n\nSource: \n\nText: OFFICE OF SHERIFF–CORONER\n County of San Joaquin – 3900\n Courthouse, Stockton, California\n Case No. 70-7475\n Standard Crime Report – Arson Vehicle (Tracy Patrol)\n558 B – FIRE\n Date and Time Occurred: 3-23-70 at 0300 Monday\n Date and Time Reported: 3-23-70 at 0340\n Location of Occurrence: Highway 132, approx. ¼ mile W. of Delta.\n Victim’s Name: JOHNS, Kathleen\n Address: 617 Campus Way, San Bernardino\n Phone: AC 714-886-1151\n Sex: Female\n Race: White\n Age: 23\n DOB: 5-30-47\n Occupation: Housewife\n Employer: Unknown\n Reporting Officer: LOVETT, Jim Ray, Badge No. 160\n Assisting Officer: Deputy, Stanislaus Co.\n Vehicle: 1957 Chevrolet Station Wagon, brown.\n License: HOU 518, California.\nDescription and Circumstances\nVehicle burned inside rural area.

The driver got out and attempted to flag them down. This incident took place near Highways 33 and 132.\nNeither of these subjects could provide a description of the driver of this white 1959 Buick.\nAccording to Sergeant Hall of Stanislaus County Sheriff’s Office, witnesses Horton and Beaman had read an article in the paper regarding the kidnap of victim Kathleen Johns, and after reading it decided to report this incident to the Sheriff’s Office, since it apparently took place in the same general area as the Johns case.\nThe Stanislaus County Sheriff’s Office did not make a separate report; this information was obtained from Sgt. Hall.\nThe undersigned, along with Detective McKay of the Stanislaus County Sheriff’s Office, made contact at witness Frederick Beaman’s residence, 300 Kerr Street, Modesto. His mother, Mrs. Teresa Watson, advised that her son had been gone from the residence since Sunday evening, March 22, 1970, and she had not heard from him since.\nShe stated her son was supposed to be staying with a friend, Bill Horton, but she had no additional information about his whereabouts. A business card was left with Mrs. Watson, who said she would have her son contact this office or report to Stockton personally.\nSigned: Dep. Ambrose\nSUPPLEMENTAL REPORT 1\nCase No. 70-7475 – Page 3\nOfficers attempted to make contact with witness William Horton but received no response at his residence.\nThey then proceeded to Reed and Son Tow Service in Tracy to search for the victim’s vehicle, a 1957 Chevrolet, California license HOU 518, in an attempt to locate keys. Officer Palm advised he had observed no keys inside the car shortly after the fire was extinguished.\nUndersigned made contact with Mr. Reed, owner of Reed and Son Tow Service. He stated he did not see any keys in the vehicle when it was towed from Highway 132, just east of Bird Road.\nMr. Reed advised that the right rear wheel had only two lug bolts in it, and both were very loose. He took two lug bolts from the right front wheel and put them on the rear wheel before towing the vehicle to his shop.\nHe further advised that on March 23, 1970, a man and woman had come to his shop inquired about the victim’s vehicle (the 1957 Chevrolet station wagon, California license HOU 518). He assumed they were the owners.\nSigned: Dep. Ambrose\nSUPPLEMENTAL REPORT 1\nCase No. 70-7475 – Page 4\nMrs. Johns stated the suspect had gone down the road a short distance, made a U-turn, and returned. He offered to drive her and her baby to a service station to get help.\nThe suspect went west on Highway 132 and pulled into a Richfield station, believed to be on Chrisman Road. It was closed. The suspect then drove around approximately one and a half hours in rural areas.\nMrs. Johns said they came into a lighted city, which she believed was Tracy. She told the suspect she was frightened and wanted to get out, but he said, “This isn’t the right one.”\nHe drove her back into the rural area, and when they came to a stop sign, she grabbed her baby and ran away across a field into an embankment in the dark. She said the suspect turned off his lights, waited about five minutes, then turned them back on and left the area.\nShe then made it to a roadway or highway (unsure which), where she was picked up by some people from Missouri who took her to Patterson.\nSigned: Dep. Ambrose\nSUPPLEMENTAL REPORT 1\nCase No. 70-7475 – Page 5\nSince there was no police department in the area, she was taken to Patterson PD, who notified Stanislaus County.\nDeputy Lovett returned to the scene to locate the vehicle. It was still smoldering when he arrived.\nHe noted the right rear wheel had one lug bolt tight, one loose, and three missing. The hubcap was gone.\nA hubcap was later located nearby, believed identical to the missing one.

On the night of March 22, 1970, 22-year-old Kathleen Johns was traveling from San Bernardino to San Francisco when she encountered a potentially life-threatening situation.\\n\\nIncident Details:\\nAround 11:15 PM, a late-model tan sedan began following Johns, repeatedly flashing its lights. When she stopped, a man approached her, claiming her left rear wheel was wobbling. He appeared to help her by manipulating the wheel's lug nuts. After driving away briefly, Johns discovered her wheel had been deliberately loosened, causing her car to become unstable.\\n\\nThe suspect returned and offered to drive her to a service station. During the subsequent drive, which lasted approximately 90 minutes, Johns reported the man made disturbing statements about killing people and throwing their bodies from vehicles. At one point, he allegedly told her, \\\"\"By the time I get through with them, they won't need any help.\\\"\"\\n\\nSuspect Description:\\n- White male, approximately 30 years old\\n- 5'9\\\"\" tall, 160 lbs\\n- Dark hair, dark complexion\\n- Wearing a dark windbreaker and black slacks\\n- Possibly wearing black-rimmed glasses\\n\\nEscape and Aftermath:\\nWhen the vehicle stopped at an intersection, Johns seized an opportunity to escape. She grabbed her 10-month-old daughter and ran across a field, hiding in a ditch until the suspect departed. She was subsequently picked up by passing motorists and brought to the Patterson Police Department.\\n\\nHer vehicle, a brown 1957 Chevrolet station wagon, was found burned approximately two miles from the incident location. Investigators determined the fire was of incendiary origin.\\n\\nZodiac Connection:\\nThe incident gained significant attention in the Zodiac Killer investigation. Johns herself noted the suspect resembled photographs she had seen of the Zodiac Killer. The Zodiac Killer later claimed credit for the abduction in his communications.\\n\\nControversy and Debate:\\nWhile some investigators consider the incident a confirmed Zodiac attack, others remain skeptical. Michael Butterfield, a Zodiac researcher, has expressed doubts about the direct connection.\\n\\nIdentification Attempts:\\nIn later investigations, Johns identified Lawrence Kane, a suspect, in a photo lineup as potentially being her abductor.\\n\\nThe Kathleen Johns incident remains a complex and unresolved chapter in the Zodiac Killer's notorious criminal history, representing one of the many mysterious encounters attributed to the unidentified serial killer.\"\"}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"generated\"\", \"\"value\"\": \"\"# The Kathleen Johns Incident\\n\\nOn March 22, 1970, at approximately 11:15 PM, Kathleen Johns, a 22-year-old woman traveling with her 10-month-old daughter Jennifer, became involved in what would later be considered a possible Zodiac Killer encounter. This incident occurred on Highway 132 near Interstate 5 outside Patterson, California, approximately 72 miles east-southeast of Vallejo.\\n\\n## The Abduction\\n\\nAccording to Johns' report to the Patterson Police Department, she was driving from San Bernardino to Petaluma to visit her sick mother when a vehicle began following her, flashing its lights. After she pulled over, a man approached her car claiming her wheel was wobbling. He offered to tighten the lug bolts on her left rear wheel. After appearing to fix the problem, Johns attempted to drive away but discovered the wheel immediately fell off, secured by only one bolt.\\n\\nThe man then offered to drive Johns and her infant daughter to a service station. Once they entered his vehicle, however, he drove them around on back roads for approximately 1.5 hours. During this time, according to Johns' statement, the man mumbled about \\\"\"killing people and throwing their bodies out of cars\\\"\" and threatened to kill her and throw her baby out afterward.\\n\\n## The Escape\\n\\nWhen the vehicle stopped at an intersection, Johns seized the opportunity to escape. She grabbed her daughter and fled across a field, hiding in a ditch until she saw the suspect drive away. She then walked or hitchhiked approximately two miles to the nearest road where a passing motorist picked her up and brought her to the Patterson Police Department at around 2:30 AM.\\n\\n## Police Investigation\\n\\nSergeant Charles J. McNatt of the Patterson Police Department documented Johns' arrival in a \\\"\"hysterical condition.\\\"\" Johns described her abductor as a white male, approximately 30 years old, 5'9\\\"\" tall, 160 pounds, with dark hair and complexion, wearing a dark windbreaker jacket and black slacks. She stated she could identify him if seen again.\\n\\nJohns' vehicle, a brown 1957 Chevrolet station wagon, was later found completely destroyed by fire approximately two miles west of Interstate 5 and one mile north of Highway 132. Investigation revealed the lug bolts on the left rear wheel were missing, and the fire appeared to be of incendiary origin.\\n\\n## Connection to the Zodiac Killer\\n\\nWhile at the police station, Johns reportedly noticed a wanted poster with a composite sketch of the Zodiac Killer and identified him as her abductor. The San Francisco Police Department was contacted regarding the possible connection to the Zodiac case.\\n\\nOn July 24, 1970, the Zodiac Killer sent a letter to the San Francisco Chronicle in which he claimed responsibility for the incident, writing that he had \\\"\"a little list\\\"\" of victims which included \\\"\"the woman + her baby that I gave a rather interesting ride for a coupple howers one evening a few months back that ended in my burning her car where I found them.\\\"\"\\n\\n## Perspectives on the Case\\n\\nThe connection between Johns' abduction and the Zodiac Killer remains debated among investigators:\\n\\n- **Supporting evidence**: The Zodiac's own claim of responsibility in his July 24 letter; Johns' identification of the composite sketch; the proximity to other Zodiac activity; and the threatening behavior consistent with the Zodiac's pattern.\\n\\n- **Skeptical view**: Some investigators question the reliability of Johns' identification and note inconsistencies in her account. The location was also farther east than the Zodiac's confirmed attacks, which were concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area.\\n\\nThe Kathleen Johns incident remains one of the most significant potential Zodiac encounters where the victim survived to provide a detailed account. Johns died of a heart attack in 2002, and the case continues to be studied as part of the broader Zodiac investigation, which remains unsolved.\"\"}\",\"{\"\"errorType\"\": \"\"emptyDependency\"\", \"\"isStale\"\": false, \"\"state\"\": \"\"error\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2026-02-15T17:19:09.000Z,true,\"Modesto, CA, Hwy 132, Patterson, CA\",the-kathleen-johns-incident,40,recqCmgTN8PuTiFGs,,,,\nrec7E9uhPbExvOStV,\"The Button Letter, Z32, & Mt.

Kaczynski, that is. He is, of course, the former UC Berkeley mathematics professor whom federal authorities believe is the Unabomber. And his legend is speeding across Berkeley faster than a white Ford Bronco on an L. A. freeway.\nTake Seewantee Keislar, for example, who didn't realize until last week that she was living in a landmark. That's when reporters from around the Bay Area and all over the country started calling her. They begged to come onto her property, take a photo of her house, squeeze any bit of information out of her they could.\nKeislar has the misfortune of being co-owner of the tri-plex at 2626 Regent St. The cottage in the back, labeled 2628A Regent street, was at one point the home of Kaczynski. The address listing is in the 1967-68 campus directory. It was the young professor's first year at Berkeley. He had just received a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan.\nBut Keislar has told reporter and anybody else who has come calling that she and her husband, Allan, bought the property in 1992 from the Krishna Copy Center. None of the parties know anything about the Unabomber. But that hasn't stopped requests for interviews and pictures. Keislar, who is also pregnant, said one television reporter cursed and threatened to hit her when she asked him to stay off her property.\nSo now Keislar has taken some dramatic measures. First, she contacted her husband, who is currently in Pakistan, and explained to him about the phone calls and the unexpected visitors. Next, she retained Berkeley attorney Jim Chanin to help keep people away. And lastly, she decided to charge $500 for each photograph taken on her property.\nShe said more that one news organization 'ready has all ready taken\nher up on that offer, although she declined to name names. \"\"Several people, because they wanted pictures, she explained. Chanin was not available for comment this week, but his law associate Sue Ochs confirmed that Keislar called their office seeking counsel.\n“He (Chanin) wants to prevent her from being harassed,\"\" Ochs said. The news organizations are doing their stories and that's all well and good, but there has to be a balance. She did call here and was very distraught.\"\"\nRegent Street isn't the only place in Berkeley where the fever has struck. Berkeley-based Jolly Roger press, which published the Unabomber's manifesto in book from last year, has been swamped with requests for additional copies.\n\"\"People are calling and want hundreds of books. It really has picked up,\"\" said Jolly Roger spokesperson Johanna Seppalainen.\nJolly Roger has taken orders in the last week for more than 1,000 copies of the manifesto, which went to a second printing in January. Distributors in San Francisco,\nNew Jersey, and even England have asked for large quantities. Individuals have also called requesting single copies. Seppalainen said that Jolly Roger's owner, Kris Lawson, who is away in Hong Kong will probably be stunned. \"\"He may not even know the Unabomber is caught. I'm sure he will be very surprised to come home and find out we've sold so many books.” If you live in the East Bay though, it's hard to imagine not knowing that a suspect is in custody.\nNewspapers, radio, and television have all made the Unabomber their top story since Kaczlrnski's arrest. The UC mathematics department, where Kaczynski taught until 1969, has received an estimated 75 to 100 calls about the former professor. '\"\"They have been pushy, some of them have been pushy,” said Marsha Snow, a math department student services assistant. Snow said things calmed down a bit after a press\nconference was held by the mathematics department and the university last Thursday.\nAbout 100 media organizations jammed the Madrone Room at the student union to hear Kaczynski's former colleagues explain how the suspect had once refused to go out for pizza and beer after speaking at a local mathematics seminar.\nTom Goldstein, dean of .UC Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism, said the media hype reminds him of the spectacle surrounding serial killer Son of Sam in New York during the 1970s. Goldstein was a reporter for the New York Times as that story developed. \"\"You have to balance trying to find out as much as you can about this person who is only a suspect and the public's appetite for information,\"\" Goldstein said. \"\"There's a ghoulish aspect to it... It's regrettable to see this whole thing exploited.\"\"\n\",1,1,0,1996-03-11,1996-03-11,Theodore Kaczynski,Unabomber fallout hits Berkeley,Fact,null,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"errorType\"\": \"\"emptyDependency\"\", \"\"isStale\"\": false, \"\"state\"\": \"\"error\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2026-02-15T17:19:09.000Z,true,\"Home of Ted Kaczynski in Berkeley, CA\",ted-kaczynski-ends-time-at-uc-berkeley,57,recxKXaAKxXseG1cq,,,,\nrec7WCKo6rJMnzZ0y,\"James Owen passes by crime scene, sees two cars\",1968-12-20,84000,\"rec9eYWhCQCUgaGyg,rec3eW7QMV2VW7WE0\",\"At roughly 11:20 p.m., Vallejo resident James Owen was driving along Lake Herman Road on his way to work the night shift at the Humble Oil company.

They parked the car about 25 feet inside of the Marshall Ranch property off of the road. They walked the creek towards the pump station. They had the dogs loose and they treed either a cat or a racoon in the area of the Dotta Ranch.

He was at the truck about a total of 5 minutes and a car came in, that has been identified as MRS [redacted]'S, it drove in, turned around and drove back in the opposite direction towards Benicia, again. He states that approximately 5 minutes later they drove in his truck a '59 Chevrolet, red in color, with white wood sideboards, cattle guards, on the sides. They drove this truck back to the Gasser Ranch heading towards Benicia and they passed the car. [redacted] insists that the Rambler was parked on the bank. That would be on the South side. He did not see any person in the car. He estimates he left the area between 11:00 and 11:15PM. He remained at the Gasser's house about an hour and then left out through Highway #21, through the Jamison Canyon and headed home, arriving about 12:30AM.\n\n[redacted] was asked if he had a rifle. He stated that he had a automatic rifle. The RO advised [redacted] of his constitutional rights at this time.

He was given a receipt for the rifle. The rifle was tested at the S/O by Rangemaster George Parks. On the basis of the findings of George Parks this rifle has been eliminated as a suspected weapon. [redacted] states that FRANK GASSER does own an automatic rifle but that he doesn't have it at the house. He suggested that we call or see a gentleman by the name of HARLAN [redacted] who lives at 106 Marquis Avenue.

Medeiros's quick action alerted authorities to the crime scene, initiating the investigation into the double homicide of two teenagers.\n\n\n> “At 11:15 p.m., local resident Stella Borges   drove past the entrance to the pumping station on her way to pick up her son from a movie theater. As her headlights came upon the turnout, she and the other passengers in her car saw the bodies of the two teenagers on the ground. David “looked like he had fallen out of the open door” of his station wagon.\n> \n> Betty was farther away, lying on her side and facing the road. Concluding that something was terribly wrong, Stella continued into Benicia as fast as possible.

They parked the car about 25 feet inside of the Marshall Ranch property off of the road. They walked the creek towards the pump station. They had the dogs loose and they treed either a cat or a racoon in the area of the Dotta Ranch.

He said it took them about 10 minutes to walk back to the truck. He was at the truck about a total of 5 minutes and a car came in, that has been identified as MRS [redacted]'S, it drove in, turned around and drove back in the opposite direction towards Benicia, again. He states that approximately 5 minutes later they drove in his truck a '59 Chevrolet, red in color, with white wood sideboards, cattle guards, on the sides. They drove this truck back to the Gasser Ranch heading towards Benicia and they passed the car. [redacted] insists that the Rambler was parked on the bank. That would be on the South side. He did not see any person in the car. He estimates he left the area between 11:00 and 11:15PM. He remained at the Gasser's house about an hour and then left out through Highway #21, through the Jamison Canyon and headed home, arriving about 12:30AM.\n\n[redacted] was asked if he had a rifle. He stated that he had a automatic rifle. The RO advised [redacted] of his constitutional rights at this time. Due to the fact that he was in the area and he did have a rifle which he claimed he\nPage 25\nSOLANO COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE FAIRFIELD, CALIFORNIA SUPPLEMENTAL INVESTIGATION REPORT\nCASE NUMBER: V-25564 page 3\nhad with him that night. He was given a receipt for the rifle. The rifle was tested at the S/O by Rangemaster George Parks. On the basis of the findings of George Parks this rifle has been eliminated as a suspected weapon. [redacted] states that FRANK GASSER does own an automatic rifle but that he doesn't have it at the house. He suggested that we call or see a gentleman by the name of HARLAN [redacted] who lives at 106 Marquis Avenue. It is possible that the gun is there, because GASSER does not leave his guns at the ranch because of recent thefts. [redacted]'s car has California license D-26024.\n(Det/Sgt.

(Conway)\nPage 8: SUPPLEMENT - Vallejo Police Department\n- CASE NO. 243146\n- CRIME CLASSIFICATION: Murder\n- 7-6-69 3:00 PM\n- Location: Intensive Care Unit, Kaiser Hospital\nRO went to location and contacted shooting victim, Michael Mageau. Was advised by Dr. Scott that RO could talk to him for a short time, however he was under medication at this time and would possibly be going to sleep shortly. RO contacted Michael who still was in very bad condition and was very strained to talk as he had had a wound in his mouth. RO asked him if he could as best as possible relate the facts as he knew them as to the occurrences of Friday night when he and D. FERRIN were shot. Michael states that he would do his best to give a statement and gave it as following.\nStates that at approximately 4:00p.m. Friday afternoon, that D. Ferrin called him up, and in their conversation stated they agreed that they would go to a movie in San Francisco that night and she would be at the house at approximately 7:30 p.m. Michael states he next heard from her at approximately 8:00p.m. when she again called and stated that she had to go with her sister, Christine, to the Miss Firecracker contest, that she would call him as soon as she could, as soon as she was clear from this. Michael states that he stayed home and at approx. 10:30 he received another call from Dea stating she would be over shortly. He stated that Dea came over at approximately 11:30 or shortly thereafter and picked him up in her car. They were both hungry as they had not had supper and were going to go get something to eat. Stated that she was driving her vehicle, the Corvair they were found in. Stated they drove west on Springs Road and as they were driving down Springs Road to go get something to eat, Dea stated to him that she wanted to talk to him about something. Michael stated that approximately at the location of Mr. Ed's on Springs Road they turned around and headed east at his suggestion to go to Blue Rock Springs Park where they could talk. They went directly out to this location, pulled the car in the parking lot where it was found by the police. Dea turned the lights and the motor off and had the radio playing. States they were there just a very short time, a few minutes, and three cars pulled in to the parking lot where they were. They were apparently young kids, and they heard some laughing and carrying on and a few firecrackers were set off, then the three vehicles left within a short time. This was just a very short space of time, a few minutes. Shortly after this and about five minutes before the shooting occurred, Michael states a vehicle pulled into the lot, coming from the direction of Springs Road and Vallejo. The driver turned the lights off on the car and pulled around to the left or east side of their car, approximately six or eight feet away and sat there for a minute. Michael states he asked Ded if she knew who it was and she stated, \"\"Oh, never mind.\"\" Michael stated at this time he is always kidding Dea about knowing so many people and does not know whether she meant this as she knew the fellow or not. Michael states as best as he can recall, he could not see the car too clearly, however the shape of the car looked similar to the car that Dea owns, a Corvair. He could not see the color or anything as it was very dark out there.\nEd Rust\nPage 9: SUPPLEMENT - Vallejo Police Department\n- CASE NO. 243146\n- CRIME CLASSIFICATION: Murder\nStates as far as he could tell this car had one male subject in it. The car then drove off and headed in the direction of Vallejo & Springs Road at a fairly fast rate of speed. He stated approximately five minutes later, the vehicle pulled up, coming from the direction of Vallejo & Springs Road. This vehicle pulled up approximately ten feet behind and to the right side of Dea's car, which would be the side that Michael was sitting. The vehicle's lights were left on and the subject got out and walked toward the car. He had a large high-powered flashlight, the kind you carry with a handle. This subject walked up to the car and Michael stated that both he and Dea believed that it was a policeman and that he wanted to check their I.D. or something. Stated subject stepped up to Michael's side of the car, which is the right side, shining the flashlight on them. Subject did not say anything to them, nor did they say anything to him. Michael stated he started to reach for his wallet as he felt it was a policeman who wanted to see his I.D. States as he did so, he heard a muffled sound and felt a pain in his back and his neck area. He states he heard some more muffled sounds, sounding like a gun with a silencer on it, and felt pains in his body, his back and around his neck. States he tried to climb over the back seat to get away from the shooting and subject kept shooting him again and again. States finally the subject quit shooting him and apparently turned the gun on Dea and started shooting her again and again. States subject then turned around and started to walk back to his vehicle which still had the headlights on. Michael stated he could not tell if he meant to yell at the subject or if he just yelled from pain, but he let out some type of yell. At this time, the subject apparently hearing him, came back to the car and shot Michael two more times, once in the back and once in the left leg. States the subject then turned the gun on Dea and shot her twice more. Michael states that all the shots that he heard were muffled, sounding similar to a gun with the silencer on. It was not loud. States the subject then turned around and casually walked back to his vehicle and got in. Michael at this time stated that he had to reach outside the car door to open it as the handle inside was broken. Stated he reached outside and opened the car door and fell outside on the ground. As he fell out onto the ground the vehicle the subject was in backed up in a turning movement and then took off toward Springs Road in Vallejo at a very high rate of speed. Michael states as the vehicle drove off he only saw the rear portion of it, this rear part appearing to be a vehicle similar to or the same type as Dea's car, a Corvair. Also a very similar color, possibly a little bit lighter brown. It had a California license, however he could not tell what the numbers were. Stated the subject continued on Blue Rock Springs Road at a very high rate of speed towards Springs Road in Vallejo.\nMichael states that in what seemed to be eight to ten minutes after this a car came by with three young hippy types in it. He can recall two boys and one girl. States he waved and yelled to the occupants of this vehicle to come over and help him. Stated they came close to him\nEd Rust\nPage 10: SUPPLEMENT - Vallejo Police Department\n- CASE NO. 243146\n- CRIME CLASSIFICATION: Murder\nand he asked them to get a doctor quick. Stated the girl told him to lie still and they would get a doctor. States approximately five to ten minutes later the police arrived in a vehicle that was not a black and white police car and other policemen arrived, and he was then taken to the hospital.\nRO asked Michael if he could give a description of the responsible subject, and he stated as best as he could recall the description is as follows. Subject appeared to be short, possibly 5'8\"\", was real heavy set, beefy build. States subject was not blubbery fat, but real beefy, possibly 195 to 200, or maybe even larger. Stated he had short curly hair, light brown, almost blond. He was wearing a short-sleeved shirt, blue in color. Cannot remember if it was light or dark blue. States he just saw subject's face from the profile, side view, and does not recall seeing a front view. States there was nothing unusual about his face, other than it appeared to be large. Michael stated the subject did not have a mustache, nor was he wearing glasses or anything. He could not recall anything unusual except that he had a large face. Michael reemphasized that he really did not get a good look at subject other than his profile. Also, it was dark out and it was hard to see the subject.\nMichael states that he could possibly recognize responsible if he had a profile view, as this is the best view he had of the subject. Stated subject was a white male, approximately 26-30 years. Was unable to judge real well what his age was. States he feels sure the subject wanted to make sure that they were dead. This due to the fact that he returned and shot each one of them twice again after the first shooting.\nWhen questioned about Dea's vehicle having the headlights on when the police arrived, Michael was unable to explain fully, however states he recalls something about possibly flashing the lights on and off to attract attention of passing vehicles. States he cannot remember if he did this or possibly Dea did it. States while still in the car he called to Dea, does not recall what he said, but recalls the only thing that she was able to do was make a small moaning sound. She was unable to say anything.\nRO questioned Michael as to a possible motive, if he had had any argument or trouble, etc. with anyone recently, or if there was any reason at all that anyone would want to harm him. He stated he could not recall anything at all, having any arguments or anything to give anyone reason to do anything like this. Also st1ated that Darlene did not say anything about any trouble that she has had. States they have always been very truthful with each other and confided very closely in each other's problems and he is sure if she had known about someone after her or had a hate for her enough to do something like this, she would have said something about it. States as far as he knows, the only type of trouble that Dea has had was sometimes her friends got mad at her. There were sometimes petty jealousies between her and her friends.\nRust\nPage 11: SUPPLEMENT - Vallejo Police Department\n- CASE NO. 243 146\n- CRIME CLASSIFICATION: Murder\nSometimes some possibly boyfriends, not exactly dating type boyfriends, but friends, just acquaintances, would become jealous over just petty incidents.\nThe interview of Michael MAGEAU was terminated by RO at this time as he was becoming very tired due to the medication and also his condition due to the gunshot wounds. RO wishes to emphasize that throughout the entire interview with Michael it was a very strained situation for him as he had been given a sedative type of medication to relax him and put him to sleep and he was straining to keep himself awake in order to give the information to RO. RO advised him to rest at this time and when he woke up if he felt better and if he felt he possibly could give more information to have the nurse call RO at the police department.

SLOVER\nPage 5: SUPPLEMENT - Vallejo Police Department\n- CASE NO. 243-146\n- CRIME CLASSIFICATION: Murder\n- 1:15am 7-5-69 Off. Hoffman\nApprox. 12:10am 7-5-69 writter copied a radio message from KMA 818 regarding two teenagers being shot at in the area of Blue Rock Springs. R.O. had just checked this area approx. 15 min. prior to this transmission, and found the parking lot of Blue Rock Springs clear of people or motor vehicles.\nProceeding to the above area, driving V.P.D. unit 130, and following unit 119. Observed unit 119 make a U-turn on Columbus Parkway just south of the Blue Rock Springs Golf Course. At this time the Police Unit stopped a late model Grey Cad. that was proceeding towards Vallejo on Columbus Parkway.

Vlo.\nR.O. then proceeded to Blue Rock Springs parking lot, thus being the first Police vehicle to arrive at this location. It was observed being parked in the southern portion of the parking lot, east of Columbus Parkway. The vehicle described in the Police broadcast as a Brown Corvair, belonging to the victims of the shooting.\nThe first subject observed by this writter was a WMA laying on his back on the ground, at the right rear of the car. This subject was later I.D. as MICHAEL RENAULT MAGEAU WMA 19yrs. DOB 10-29-49 residing at 864 Beechwood, Vlo. This person advised he had been shot but could afford no further info. to this Off. at this time. It was evident this subject in severe pain and suffering from multiple gun shot wounds. Blood was running freely from his mouth, with another wound visible in his lower left leg.\nThe second subject observed by R.O. was a WFA in a sitting position behind the steering wheel of the afore mentioned auto. She was sitting with her head resting on the inside of the left door, at the window level. The observation of this girl was made from the open window of the right door. It was noted that her body bore three bullet holes, veiwing it from this position. There were two gunshot wounds in her upper right arm, and one bullet entry visible in her right side a few inches below the arm pit. R.O. at this point went to the left side of the auto and viewed this girl thru the open left door window. Writter did not observe another bullet wound from this position. But did view a substantial amount of blood splatered about the car. This subject was later I.D. as Darlene ELIZABETH FERRIN WFA 22yrs. DOB 3-17-47 residing at 930 Montery, Vlo.\nAt this point Sgt. Conway arrived at the scene and was informed by R.O. that in fact this was a shooting. Also requested of Sgt. Conway by writter, was to proceed back the area where Police unit 119 was. And in fact detain Andy [redacted] Jr. for further investigation as to the responsibility of this crime.\nOff. D. Clark arrived at the scene next and he plus R.O. attempted to render aid to victims untill the ambulance arrived.\nPage 6: SUPPLEMENT - Vallejo Police Department\n- CASE NO. 243-146.\n- CRIME CLASSIFICATION: Murder\n- 5:15am 7-5-69 Off. Hoffman\nPrior to the arrival of the ambulance, R.O. searched the area of the parking lot in which the victims vehicle was standing. This search discovered what appeared to be seven(7) empty shell caseings. These caseings bore the caliber on the base of the shell, that being a 9mm. These caseings belived to have been ejected from an automatic pistol. The seven (7) empty shells were found a few feet away from the victims auto on the right side. All of these shell cases have been taged into evidence under this case number.\nSolano ambulance arrived and transported the victims to Kaiser Hosp. Writter rode with the victims enroute to the hosp. Neither of these subjects spoke while in the ambulance.\nApprox. 12:38am 7-5-69\nArrived Kaiser Hosp. subject DARLENE FERRIN was attended by Dr. Borc and pronouned Dead On Arrival.

This subject was wearing an assortment of clothing consisting of three (3) pairs of trousers, one (1) T-shirt, three (3) sweaters and one long sleeved button shirt. These items of clothing were received by R.O. and placed into evidence under this case number.\nDuring the time MAGEAU was being treated for his wounds he remained conscious. He was in severe pain and could'nt tell a continuing story. Through different questions, he gave the following story in segments.\n\"\"A white man drove up in a car, got out, walked up to car, shined flashlite inside and started shooting. Man was older than me, window was down. After stop shooting I got out of car, I tryed to get the people to come over but they drove off. After finally ten minutes the Policeman came.\"\"\nAt the time this subject was taken to I.C.U. this Off. left Kaiser returning to V.P.D. (Hoffman)\nPage 7: SUPPLEMENT - Vallejo Police Department\n- CASE NO. 243 146\n- 7-5-69 6AM - report written\n7-5-69 12:10AM - Rcvd call via KMA 818 that someone had been shot at in the vicinity of Blue Rock Springs & that the compl. would be waiting there. Operator gave detail to Off's Meyring & Lindemann in unit 119. RO also responded from the East side of town & upon arriving on Columbus Parkway in vicinity of golf course, observed detailed officers on a car stop. Off. Meyring advised they stopped the veh because it was in the area & that they were making P.I. reports. RO then proceeded to the parking lot on the E side of street at the park & noted that off. Hoffman was at the scene & a wht male subj. lying on the ground to the rt rear of a 1963 brn Chev. Corvair, 2dr, CRV 209. This subj. with blood all over his face & later identified as Michael R. Mageau, WM, 19 of 864 Beechwood. Prior to getting out of the unit Off. Hoffman requested I return to car stop of Off. Meyring & Lindemann & have them hold the subj's they had stopped. RO proceeded back to carstop & instructed officers to arrest the two subj's, a WM & WF for investigation of felony, & make a search of their veh. RO then returned to Off. Hoffman.\nOn initial arrival, RO requested by radio an ambulance & an investigator at the scene & upon returning to Off. Hoffman RO went to assistance of subj. on ground, as Off. Hoffman was with a subj that was sitting on left front seat behind wheel that was also injured. This subj. later identified as Darlene E. Ferrin, WF, 19, of 864 Beechwood.\nOn prelimanary examination of Mageau, it was apparent that he had been shot a number of times, he had blood all over his face & blood coming from his mouth as well as his left leg with blood. RO felt it was necessary to question subj. inspight of the fact the subj. was in great pain. Subj. was coherent & RO asked him, \"\"do you know who shot you?\"\" & he replied \"\"no\"\". RO then asked Mageau to give me some type of description & he replied that he can't. RO then asked a series of question & was told by Mageau that the resp. was a wht male, young, & heavy set by himself & that he was in a brown veh. RO then asked if the resp. said anything & Mageau replied, \"\"no, he just started shooting & kept shooting.\"\" Questioning continued until arrival of ambulance at which time both veh. was placed in ambulance & removed from the scene. By this time Sgt's Rust, Lynch & Odiorne had arrived at the scene & RO gave them the information obtained from the victim & gave a description over the air to all units. It was at this time it was determined that Sgt's Lynch & Rust would be the investigating officers & the investigation was then turned over to them.\nRO then left the scene upon being advised by radio that the possible resp. had called the station from a pay phone at the corner of Tuolumne & Springs Rd. RO proceeded to that location to cover the detailed unit 122, Off's Agenbroad & Pegg. Upon arriving at that location it was determined resp. was not at that location & the detailed off's were instructed to stand by until an I.D. technician could get there to check for prints. (Conway)\nPage 8: SUPPLEMENT - Vallejo Police Department\n- CASE NO. 243146\n- CRIME CLASSIFICATION: Murder\n- 7-6-69 3:00 PM\n- Location: Intensive Care Unit, Kaiser Hospital\nRO went to location and contacted shooting victim, Michael Mageau. Was advised by Dr. Scott that RO could talk to him for a short time, however he was under medication at this time and would possibly be going to sleep shortly. RO contacted Michael who still was in very bad condition and was very strained to talk as he had had a wound in his mouth. RO asked him if he could as best as possible relate the facts as he knew them as to the occurrences of Friday night when he and D. FERRIN were shot. Michael states that he would do his best to give a statement and gave it as following.\nStates that at approximately 4:00p.m. Friday afternoon, that D. Ferrin called him up, and in their conversation stated they agreed that they would go to a movie in San Francisco that night and she would be at the house at approximately 7:30 p.m. Michael states he next heard from her at approximately 8:00p.m. when she again called and stated that she had to go with her sister, Christine, to the Miss Firecracker contest, that she would call him as soon as she could, as soon as she was clear from this. Michael states that he stayed home and at approx. 10:30 he received another call from Dea stating she would be over shortly. He stated that Dea came over at approximately 11:30 or shortly thereafter and picked him up in her car. They were both hungry as they had not had supper and were going to go get something to eat. Stated that she was driving her vehicle, the Corvair they were found in. Stated they drove west on Springs Road and as they were driving down Springs Road to go get something to eat, Dea stated to him that she wanted to talk to him about something. Michael stated that approximately at the location of Mr. Ed's on Springs Road they turned around and headed east at his suggestion to go to Blue Rock Springs Park where they could talk. They went directly out to this location, pulled the car in the parking lot where it was found by the police. Dea turned the lights and the motor off and had the radio playing. States they were there just a very short time, a few minutes, and three cars pulled in to the parking lot where they were. They were apparently young kids, and they heard some laughing and carrying on and a few firecrackers were set off, then the three vehicles left within a short time. This was just a very short space of time, a few minutes. Shortly after this and about five minutes before the shooting occurred, Michael states a vehicle pulled into the lot, coming from the direction of Springs Road and Vallejo. The driver turned the lights off on the car and pulled around to the left or east side of their car, approximately six or eight feet away and sat there for a minute. Michael states he asked Ded if she knew who it was and she stated, \"\"Oh, never mind.\"\" Michael stated at this time he is always kidding Dea about knowing so many people and does not know whether she meant this as she knew the fellow or not. Michael states as best as he can recall, he could not see the car too clearly, however the shape of the car looked similar to the car that Dea owns, a Corvair. He could not see the color or anything as it was very dark out there.\nEd Rust\nPage 9: SUPPLEMENT - Vallejo Police Department\n- CASE NO. 243146\n- CRIME CLASSIFICATION: Murder\nStates as far as he could tell this car had one male subject in it. The car then drove off and headed in the direction of Vallejo & Springs Road at a fairly fast rate of speed. He stated approximately five minutes later, the vehicle pulled up, coming from the direction of Vallejo & Springs Road. This vehicle pulled up approximately ten feet behind and to the right side of Dea's car, which would be the side that Michael was sitting. The vehicle's lights were left on and the subject got out and walked toward the car. He had a large high-powered flashlight, the kind you carry with a handle. This subject walked up to the car and Michael stated that both he and Dea believed that it was a policeman and that he wanted to check their I.D. or something. Stated subject stepped up to Michael's side of the car, which is the right side, shining the flashlight on them. Subject did not say anything to them, nor did they say anything to him. Michael stated he started to reach for his wallet as he felt it was a policeman who wanted to see his I.D. States as he did so, he heard a muffled sound and felt a pain in his back and his neck area. He states he heard some more muffled sounds, sounding like a gun with a silencer on it, and felt pains in his body, his back and around his neck. States he tried to climb over the back seat to get away from the shooting and subject kept shooting him again and again. States finally the subject quit shooting him and apparently turned the gun on Dea and started shooting her again and again. States subject then turned around and started to walk back to his vehicle which still had the headlights on. Michael stated he could not tell if he meant to yell at the subject or if he just yelled from pain, but he let out some type of yell. At this time, the subject apparently hearing him, came back to the car and shot Michael two more times, once in the back and once in the left leg. States the subject then turned the gun on Dea and shot her twice more. Michael states that all the shots that he heard were muffled, sounding similar to a gun with the silencer on. It was not loud. States the subject then turned around and casually walked back to his vehicle and got in. Michael at this time stated that he had to reach outside the car door to open it as the handle inside was broken. Stated he reached outside and opened the car door and fell outside on the ground. As he fell out onto the ground the vehicle the subject was in backed up in a turning movement and then took off toward Springs Road in Vallejo at a very high rate of speed. Michael states as the vehicle drove off he only saw the rear portion of it, this rear part appearing to be a vehicle similar to or the same type as Dea's car, a Corvair. Also a very similar color, possibly a little bit lighter brown. It had a California license, however he could not tell what the numbers were. Stated the subject continued on Blue Rock Springs Road at a very high rate of speed towards Springs Road in Vallejo.\nMichael states that in what seemed to be eight to ten minutes after this a car came by with three young hippy types in it. He can recall two boys and one girl. States he waved and yelled to the occupants of this vehicle to come over and help him. Stated they came close to him\nEd Rust\nPage 10: SUPPLEMENT - Vallejo Police Department\n- CASE NO. 243146\n- CRIME CLASSIFICATION: Murder\nand he asked them to get a doctor quick. Stated the girl told him to lie still and they would get a doctor. States approximately five to ten minutes later the police arrived in a vehicle that was not a black and white police car and other policemen arrived, and he was then taken to the hospital.\nRO asked Michael if he could give a description of the responsible subject, and he stated as best as he could recall the description is as follows. Subject appeared to be short, possibly 5'8\"\", was real heavy set, beefy build. States subject was not blubbery fat, but real beefy, possibly 195 to 200, or maybe even larger. Stated he had short curly hair, light brown, almost blond. He was wearing a short-sleeved shirt, blue in color. Cannot remember if it was light or dark blue. States he just saw subject's face from the profile, side view, and does not recall seeing a front view. States there was nothing unusual about his face, other than it appeared to be large. Michael stated the subject did not have a mustache, nor was he wearing glasses or anything. He could not recall anything unusual except that he had a large face. Michael reemphasized that he really did not get a good look at subject other than his profile. Also, it was dark out and it was hard to see the subject.\nMichael states that he could possibly recognize responsible if he had a profile view, as this is the best view he had of the subject. Stated subject was a white male, approximately 26-30 years. Was unable to judge real well what his age was. States he feels sure the subject wanted to make sure that they were dead. This due to the fact that he returned and shot each one of them twice again after the first shooting.\nWhen questioned about Dea's vehicle having the headlights on when the police arrived, Michael was unable to explain fully, however states he recalls something about possibly flashing the lights on and off to attract attention of passing vehicles. States he cannot remember if he did this or possibly Dea did it. States while still in the car he called to Dea, does not recall what he said, but recalls the only thing that she was able to do was make a small moaning sound. She was unable to say anything.\nRO questioned Michael as to a possible motive, if he had had any argument or trouble, etc. with anyone recently, or if there was any reason at all that anyone would want to harm him. He stated he could not recall anything at all, having any arguments or anything to give anyone reason to do anything like this. Also st1ated that Darlene did not say anything about any trouble that she has had. States they have always been very truthful with each other and confided very closely in each other's problems and he is sure if she had known about someone after her or had a hate for her enough to do something like this, she would have said something about it. States as far as he knows, the only type of trouble that Dea has had was sometimes her friends got mad at her. There were sometimes petty jealousies between her and her friends.\nRust\nPage 11: SUPPLEMENT - Vallejo Police Department\n- CASE NO. 243 146\n- CRIME CLASSIFICATION: Murder\nSometimes some possibly boyfriends, not exactly dating type boyfriends, but friends, just acquaintances, would become jealous over just petty incidents.\nThe interview of Michael MAGEAU was terminated by RO at this time as he was becoming very tired due to the medication and also his condition due to the gunshot wounds. RO wishes to emphasize that throughout the entire interview with Michael it was a very strained situation for him as he had been given a sedative type of medication to relax him and put him to sleep and he was straining to keep himself awake in order to give the information to RO. RO advised him to rest at this time and when he woke up if he felt better and if he felt he possibly could give more information to have the nurse call RO at the police department. (Rust)\nEd Rust\nPage 12: SUPPLEMENT - Vallejo Police Department\n- CASE NO. 243 146\n- 4:30am 7-5-69 Sgt.

Dave Toschi has been looking for one particular pot-bellied man, about 5-feet-8 tall, 200 pounds, with short reddish brown hair and glasses on his round face. 1\nThe man appears intelligent and may have learned cryptography in the military. 2 He sometimes wears pleated pants over sine shoes. On weekdays, he may work at a menial job where he is looked upon as little more than a name and number. On weekends, he takes pleasure in killing unarmed strangers. 3\nHe calls himself Zodiac. 4\nIn boastful, taunting, sometimes coded communications, Zodiac has claimed a number of murders. 5\nZodiac is a personal nemesis for Toschi, now the only San Francisco Police Department officer assigned to the case. 6 His case files fill seven large drawers, one for each frustrating year on Zodiac’s trail. He carries a copy of Zodiac’s last letter at all times — a reminder that the killer may still be at large. 7\n“To be honest, I’m no closer now to solving the case,” the dapper, curly-haired detective says with a tug at his bow tie. 8“It’s been a paper chase for me. My files are getting larger. I doubt I’ll get him unless he makes a mistake or kills again. I don’t know where he is.” 9\n### UNSOLVED MURDERS\n“He has a personal box score,” the homicide detective says. “We know for sure he killed at least six and wounded two in the late 1960s, but there are many unsolved homicides. He hasn’t taken credit for any specific killings in the last few years, yet whenever we get a new letter postmarked from him, the score goes up.” 10\nZodiac has claimed responsibility for a host of murders, several of which police say he definitely did not commit. 11But they are certain the following attacks belong in his “boxscore”: 12\n- On Oct. 30, 1966, a man slashed the throat of a University of California coed, Cheri Jo Bates, in a Riverside parking lot. 13\n- On Dec. 20, 1968, a man used a pencil flashlight taped to the barrel of a .22-caliber pistol to find and kill David Faraday and Betty Lou Jensen on a dark lover’s lane near Vallejo. 14\n- On July 5, 1969, less than four miles from the double murder, a man repeatedly fired a 9mm pistol into another parked car, killing Mrs. Darlene Ferrin, 22, and wounding Michael Mageau, 19. 15\n- A black-hooded man tied up and repeatedly stabbed Bryan Hartnell and Cecelia Ann Shepard at Lake Berryessa Park, about 20 miles north of Napa. The woman died from stab wounds but Hartnell recovered. 16161616\n- On Oct. 11, 1969, a man pumped four bullets into the head of taxi driver Paul Stine, 29, in a posh San Francisco neighborhood. 17171717\n### STRANGE PATTERN\nThe first known slaying and the last known slaying are considered particularly strange. Zodiac did not boast of the first, the only slaying outside the San Francisco Bay area. And the last did not fit his pattern. 18\n“The other killings were in remote areas and no money was taken,” Toschi observed. “This last one was a sloppy holdup.” 19“He had to have gotten blood on his hands and clothing. Maybe he got a total of $8.” 20\nDid Zodiac need money, or did he want to change his techniques, never using the same weapon twice? He concealed his face during a daylight murder, and he used a knife rather than a gun when shots would attract attention. 21212121\n### HIS MOTIVATION\nWhat drives Zodiac to kill? 22\nIn his own decoded words, Zodiac said, “I like killing people because it is so much fun, it is more fun than killing wild game in the forest because man is the most dangerous animal of all, to kill something gives me the most thrilling experie23nce. The best part of it is that when I die I will be reborn in paradice, and all I have killed will become my slaves.” 242424242424242424\nToschi tends to dismiss the witchcraft-Satanic implications. “He was trying to be dramatic. If he had much of an interest in the occult, he never would have misspelled paradise as ‘paradice.’ I think the letters are a screen, not a real clue.” 25\nIs Zodiac a perverse sex killer? “There’s no evidence he ever molested any of his victims, nor did he do any fondling or use filthy language,” Toschi says. 26“Some psychiatrists will tell you he’s a latent homosexual or he hates women. I think he gets sexual gratification or pleasure from killing unarmed people. One victim said he was laughing loudly and hideously while stabbing a woman victim.” 2728\n### SUSPICIOUS WIVES\nToschi says this after pinning down 2,000 possible suspects whose names were provided by concerned citizens, police officers, prison officials and others. 29\n“I’ve even had wives come in and tell me they suspect their husband,” he says. 30“But I never joke about the Zodiac. I’ll talk to anybody about the case on the chance they know something.” 31\nZodiac has not sent a direct statement in months, but that’s not unprecedented. 32In January 1974, after a silence of 34 months, he wrote to update his murder count and to pan the gut-wrenching movie, “The Exorcist,” as “bad comedy.” 33Then in July 1974, he wrote a letter to the San Francisco Chronicle, decrying ads for the movie “Badlands” as “murder glorification.” 34“Why don’t you show some concern for public sensibilities and cut this ad,” printed the man who terrorized the area with grisly murders and occasional threats against busloads of children. 35353535The letter was signed, “A Citizen,” but alert mail room workers recognized his printing, which was then verified by handwriting experts. 36\n“When we get intervals of silence, it’s possible he’s in the hospital or in prison where he wouldn’t dare send a letter,” Toschi says. “But this is only supposition.” 37\n### FOUR QUESTIONS\nA newspaper article will prompt a rash of tips. He has consulted psychics and astrologers for clues. Four men considered likely suspects were placed under surveillance, fingerprinted and questioned extensively. But nothing has panned out. 38\nJust what do police know about the mystery killer? 39They have partial fingerprints but not enough to make an identification. 40They have an admittedly weak physical description based on accounts of survivors and witnesses. 41414141They are almost certain he wears glasses since he even wore them during the daytime stabbing at Lake Berryessa. 42They believe he lives in the San Francisco Bay area since most of his communications were mailed from this area. 43434343\nJudging from Zodiac’s physical description, his use of dated jargon, Toschi estimates that he may be 35 to 45 years old. “I would speculate he maybe has a menial job, is not well thought of and blends into the crowd,” he said. “He might be a room clerk or work for a big insurance company. A name and a number.” 44444444\n“In 1969, I felt we’d solve the case. Zodiac would make a mistake or he’d come in and surrender,” Toschi says. “I never thought then that I’d still be working on the case now. Dammit, I hope I can solve it. I have seven or eight years before I’m eligible for retirement.” 45454545\n\",,\"recBksQ4rNpargfGq,recBW1sjFd6IbumEm\",,,,,,1976,September,Friday,,Case Event,1976-09-10T00:00:00.000Z,9/10/1976,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Vallejo%20Times-Herald%20article%20on%20Toschi&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Vallejo%20Times-Herald%20article%20on%20Toschi&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2025-09-14T00:55:25.000Z,,,1976-09-10T00:00:00.000Z,,,2,0,0,,,\"David Toschi, Vallejo Times-Herald\",,Fact,,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"errorType\"\": \"\"emptyDependency\"\", \"\"isStale\"\": false, \"\"state\"\": \"\"error\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2026-02-15T17:19:09.000Z,true,\"Vallejo, CA, San Francisco\",vallejo-times-herald-article-on-toschi,70,rec7k41MR4C8XL9dj,,,,\nrecbVrvunnpDEQp2s,Benicia police arrive on scene,1968-12-20,84480,rec9eYWhCQCUgaGyg,\"12-20-68 @ 11:28 P.M.

She lives on Lake Herman Road across from her parents house, two and seven-tenth's miles from the scene of the crime.\nMRS MEDEIROS relates that she came in from Oakland at approximately 10:50PM. Her mother called on the telephone and requested that she pick up her son, age 13, at the show. She states that she did not take her coat off, and glanced at the clock in the kitchen and she believes it was 11:10PM. She rode with her mother-in-law and her daughter and drove casually over the 2-7/10th miles, this time the distance being established by the officers, and she arrived at the area four or five minutes later. She estimates between 11:14 and 11:15 PM. Her clock is one minute fast as we had found out during this interview. She states that no cars were going in either direction while she\nPage 20\nSTATEMENT: STELLA MEDEIROS 12/24/68 11:25 AM\nwas on the road. When she arrived at the scene, headlights picked up the car and she observed a boy and he looked like he had fallen out of the open door. The girl was lying on her side facing the road. She had a purple dress on and looked well dressed. She saw only one car at the scene. It looked like a Rambler, grayish in color, it had a chrome rack on the top. This fits the description of the FARADAY Rambler. She states that she drove sixty or seventy miles an hour enroute to Benicia to report the incident. When she saw the police car she honked her horn and blinked her lights to attract the attention of the police officers.\n(Det/Sgt.

They had their 1959 pick-up truck, Red in color, with wood side-boards, parked inside the field of the Marshall Ranch.\nIn this interview it was learned that they were hunting in the area from 9:00PM to 11:00PM. 11:00PM was approximate, because [redacted] looked at his watch and he knew it was in the area of 11:00PM. It could have been five minutes to the hour or ten minutes to.

They claimed that they left the area several minutes after [redacted], who established the time as 11:20, that they left the scene. They described the light colored 1960 Rambler S/W that was parked at the gate. It was parked Southwest of where we finally found the car. This discrepancy wasn't noted at first. This was a statement as to their activity during that night. They said that when they arrived there at 9:00PM a white 4-door hardtop, a '59 or '60 Impala, was parked there, and also, a truck coming out of the gate.

He states that he went to the Gasser Ranch at approximately 6:00PM. They sat around awhile and didn't leave until several hours later. They arrived in the area of the pump station around 9:00PM. They parked the car about 25 feet inside of the Marshall Ranch property off of the road. They walked the creek towards the pump station. They had the dogs loose and they treed either a cat or a racoon in the area of the Dotta Ranch. While they were there they saw some sort of activity up there, all the lights were on, but they were a little distance away and couldn't tell what the activity was. The dogs treed a racoon in an oak tree near the Pump Station.

He said it took them about 10 minutes to walk back to the truck. He was at the truck about a total of 5 minutes and a car came in, that has been identified as MRS [redacted]'S, it drove in, turned around and drove back in the opposite direction towards Benicia, again. He states that approximately 5 minutes later they drove in his truck a '59 Chevrolet, red in color, with white wood sideboards, cattle guards, on the sides. They drove this truck back to the Gasser Ranch heading towards Benicia and they passed the car. [redacted] insists that the Rambler was parked on the bank. That would be on the South side. He did not see any person in the car. He estimates he left the area between 11:00 and 11:15PM. He remained at the Gasser's house about an hour and then left out through Highway #21, through the Jamison Canyon and headed home, arriving about 12:30AM.\n\n[redacted] was asked if he had a rifle. He stated that he had a automatic rifle. The RO advised [redacted] of his constitutional rights at this time. Due to the fact that he was in the area and he did have a rifle which he claimed he\nPage 25\nSOLANO COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE FAIRFIELD, CALIFORNIA SUPPLEMENTAL INVESTIGATION REPORT\nCASE NUMBER: V-25564 page 3\nhad with him that night. He was given a receipt for the rifle. The rifle was tested at the S/O by Rangemaster George Parks. On the basis of the findings of George Parks this rifle has been eliminated as a suspected weapon. [redacted] states that FRANK GASSER does own an automatic rifle but that he doesn't have it at the house. He suggested that we call or see a gentleman by the name of HARLAN [redacted] who lives at 106 Marquis Avenue. It is possible that the gun is there, because GASSER does not leave his guns at the ranch because of recent thefts. [redacted]'s car has California license D-26024.\n(Det/Sgt.

They parked the car about 25 feet inside of the Marshall Ranch property off of the road. They walked the creek towards the pump station. They had the dogs loose and they treed either a cat or a racoon in the area of the Dotta Ranch.

He was at the truck about a total of 5 minutes and a car came in, that has been identified as MRS [redacted]'S, it drove in, turned around and drove back in the opposite direction towards Benicia, again. He states that approximately 5 minutes later they drove in his truck a '59 Chevrolet, red in color, with white wood sideboards, cattle guards, on the sides. They drove this truck back to the Gasser Ranch heading towards Benicia and they passed the car. [redacted] insists that the Rambler was parked on the bank. That would be on the South side. He did not see any person in the car. He estimates he left the area between 11:00 and 11:15PM. He remained at the Gasser's house about an hour and then left out through Highway #21, through the Jamison Canyon and headed home, arriving about 12:30AM.\n\n[redacted] was asked if he had a rifle. He stated that he had a automatic rifle. The RO advised [redacted] of his constitutional rights at this time. Due to the fact that he was in the area and he did have a rifle which he claimed he\nPage 25\nSOLANO COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE FAIRFIELD, CALIFORNIA SUPPLEMENTAL INVESTIGATION REPORT\nCASE NUMBER: V-25564 page 3\nhad with him that night. He was given a receipt for the rifle. The rifle was tested at the S/O by Rangemaster George Parks. On the basis of the findings of George Parks this rifle has been eliminated as a suspected weapon. [redacted] states that FRANK GASSER does own an automatic rifle but that he doesn't have it at the house. He suggested that we call or see a gentleman by the name of HARLAN [redacted] who lives at 106 Marquis Avenue. It is possible that the gun is there, because GASSER does not leave his guns at the ranch because of recent thefts. [redacted]'s car has California license D-26024.\n(Det/Sgt.

They had their 1959 pick-up truck, Red in color, with wood side-boards, parked inside the field of the Marshall Ranch.\nIn this interview it was learned that they were hunting in the area from 9:00PM to 11:00PM. 11:00PM was approximate, because [redacted] looked at his watch and he knew it was in the area of 11:00PM. It could have been five minutes to the hour or ten minutes to.

They arrived at the truck and shortly a car pulled into the driveway, which was later identified as belonging to [redacted]. They claimed that they left the area several minutes after [redacted], who established the time as 11:20, that they left the scene. They described the light colored 1960 Rambler S/W that was parked at the gate. It was parked Southwest of where we finally found the car. This discrepancy wasn't noted at first. This was a statement as to their activity during that night. They said that when they arrived there at 9:00PM a white 4-door hardtop, a '59 or '60 Impala, was parked there, and also, a truck coming out of the gate.

They parked the car about 25 feet inside of the Marshall Ranch property off of the road. They walked the creek towards the pump station. They had the dogs loose and they treed either a cat or a racoon in the area of the Dotta Ranch. While they were there they saw some sort of activity up there, all the lights were on, but they were a little distance away and couldn't tell what the activity was. The dogs treed a racoon in an oak tree near the Pump Station. The racoon was shot with\n### **Page 24**\n**SOLANO COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE** **FAIRFIELD, CALIFORNIA** **SUPPLEMENTAL INVESTIGATION REPORT**\n**CASE NUMBER:** V-25564 **RE: [redacted] SECOND INTERVIEW**\na long barrell .22 revolver. [partially illegible]\n[redacted] remembers looking at his watch around 11:00 PM or five or ten minutes before and they headed back towards the car. He said it took them about 10 minutes to walk back to the truck. He was at the truck about a total of 5 minutes and a car came in, that has been identified as MRS [redacted]'S, it drove in, turned around and drove back in the opposite direction towards Benicia, again. He states that approximately 5 minutes later they drove in his truck a '59 Chevrolet, red in color, with white wood sideboards, cattle guards, on the sides. They drove this truck back to the Gasser Ranch heading towards Benicia and they passed the car. [redacted] insists that the Rambler was parked on the bank. That would be on the South side. He did not see any person in the car. He estimates he left the area between 11:00 and 11:15PM. He remained at the Gasser's house about an hour and then left out through Highway #21, through the Jamison Canyon and headed home, arriving about 12:30AM.\n\n[redacted] was asked if he had a rifle. He stated that he had a automatic rifle. The RO advised [redacted] of his constitutional rights at this time. Due to the fact that he was in the area and he did have a rifle which he claimed he\n### **Page 25**\n**SOLANO COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE** **FAIRFIELD, CALIFORNIA** **SUPPLEMENTAL INVESTIGATION REPORT**\n**CASE NUMBER:** V-25564 **page 3**\nhad with him that night. He was given a receipt for the rifle. The rifle was tested at the S/O by Rangemaster George Parks. On the basis of the findings of George Parks this rifle has been eliminated as a suspected weapon. [redacted] states that FRANK GASSER does own an automatic rifle but that he doesn't have it at the house. He suggested that we call or see a gentleman by the name of HARLAN [redacted] who lives at 106 Marquis Avenue. It is possible that the gun is there, because GASSER does not leave his guns at the ranch because of recent thefts. [redacted]'s car has California license D-26024.\n(Det/Sgt.

He states that he went to the Gasser Ranch at approximately 6:00PM. They sat around awhile and didn't leave until several hours later. They arrived in the area of the pump station around 9:00PM. They parked the car about 25 feet inside of the Marshall Ranch property off of the road. They walked the creek towards the pump station. They had the dogs loose and they treed either a cat or a racoon in the area of the Dotta Ranch. While they were there they saw some sort of activity up there, all the lights were on, but they were a little distance away and couldn't tell what the activity was.

He was at the truck about a total of 5 minutes and a car came in, that has been identified as MRS [redacted]'S, it drove in, turned around and drove back in the opposite direction towards Benicia, again. He states that approximately 5 minutes later they drove in his truck a '59 Chevrolet, red in color, with white wood sideboards, cattle guards, on the sides. They drove this truck back to the Gasser Ranch heading towards Benicia and they passed the car. [redacted] insists that the Rambler was parked on the bank. That would be on the South side. He did not see any person in the car. He estimates he left the area between 11:00 and 11:15PM. He remained at the Gasser's house about an hour and then left out through Highway #21, through the Jamison Canyon and headed home, arriving about 12:30AM.\n\n[redacted] was asked if he had a rifle. He stated that he had a automatic rifle. The RO advised [redacted] of his constitutional rights at this time. Due to the fact that he was in the area and he did have a rifle which he claimed he\nPage 25\nSOLANO COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE FAIRFIELD, CALIFORNIA SUPPLEMENTAL INVESTIGATION REPORT\nCASE NUMBER: V-25564 page 3\nhad with him that night. He was given a receipt for the rifle. The rifle was tested at the S/O by Rangemaster George Parks. On the basis of the findings of George Parks this rifle has been eliminated as a suspected weapon. [redacted] states that FRANK GASSER does own an automatic rifle but that he doesn't have it at the house. He suggested that we call or see a gentleman by the name of HARLAN [redacted] who lives at 106 Marquis Avenue. It is possible that the gun is there, because GASSER does not leave his guns at the ranch because of recent thefts. [redacted]'s car has California license D-26024.\n(Det/Sgt.

Hoffman\nApprox. 12:10am 7-5-69 writter copied a radio message from KMA 818 regarding two teenagers being shot at in the area of Blue Rock Springs. R.O. had just checked this area approx. 15 min. prior to this transmission, and found the parking lot of Blue Rock Springs clear of people or motor vehicles.\nProceeding to the above area, driving V.P.D. unit 130, and following unit 119. Observed unit 119 make a U-turn on Columbus Parkway just south of the Blue Rock Springs Golf Course. At this time the Police Unit stopped a late model Grey Cad. that was proceeding towards Vallejo on Columbus Parkway. As the driver got out of this Cad. he was reconized by writter as Andy [redacted] Jr. WMA 19yrs. residing at 22 [redacted] Ct. Vlo.\nR.O. then proceeded to Blue Rock Springs parking lot, thus being the first Police vehicle to arrive at this location. It was observed being parked in the southern portion of the parking lot, east of Columbus Parkway. The vehicle described in the Police broadcast as a Brown Corvair, belonging to the victims of the shooting.\nThe first subject observed by this writter was a WMA laying on his back on the ground, at the right rear of the car. This subject was later I.D. as MICHAEL RENAULT MAGEAU WMA 19yrs. DOB 10-29-49 residing at 864 Beechwood, Vlo. This person advised he had been shot but could afford no further info. to this Off. at this time. It was evident this subject in severe pain and suffering from multiple gun shot wounds. Blood was running freely from his mouth, with another wound visible in his lower left leg.\nThe second subject observed by R.O. was a WFA in a sitting position behind the steering wheel of the afore mentioned auto. She was sitting with her head resting on the inside of the left door, at the window level. The observation of this girl was made from the open window of the right door. It was noted that her body bore three bullet holes, veiwing it from this position. There were two gunshot wounds in her upper right arm, and one bullet entry visible in her right side a few inches below the arm pit. R.O. at this point went to the left side of the auto and viewed this girl thru the open left door window. Writter did not observe another bullet wound from this position. But did view a substantial amount of blood splatered about the car. This subject was later I.D. as Darlene ELIZABETH FERRIN WFA 22yrs. DOB 3-17-47 residing at 930 Montery, Vlo.\nAt this point Sgt. Conway arrived at the scene and was informed by R.O. that in fact this was a shooting. Also requested of Sgt. Conway by writter, was to proceed back the area where Police unit 119 was. And in fact detain Andy [redacted] Jr. for further investigation as to the responsibility of this crime.\nOff. D. Clark arrived at the scene next and he plus R.O. attempted to render aid to victims untill the ambulance arrived.\nPage 6: SUPPLEMENT - Vallejo Police Department\n- CASE NO. 243-146.\n- CRIME CLASSIFICATION: Murder\n- 5:15am 7-5-69 Off. Hoffman\nPrior to the arrival of the ambulance, R.O. searched the area of the parking lot in which the victims vehicle was standing. This search discovered what appeared to be seven(7) empty shell caseings. These caseings bore the caliber on the base of the shell, that being a 9mm. These caseings belived to have been ejected from an automatic pistol. The seven (7) empty shells were found a few feet away from the victims auto on the right side. All of these shell cases have been taged into evidence under this case number.\nSolano ambulance arrived and transported the victims to Kaiser Hosp. Writter rode with the victims enroute to the hosp. Neither of these subjects spoke while in the ambulance.\nApprox. 12:38am 7-5-69\nArrived Kaiser Hosp. subject DARLENE FERRIN was attended by Dr. Borc and pronouned Dead On Arrival.

This subject was wearing an assortment of clothing consisting of three (3) pairs of trousers, one (1) T-shirt, three (3) sweaters and one long sleeved button shirt. These items of clothing were received by R.O. and placed into evidence under this case number.\nDuring the time MAGEAU was being treated for his wounds he remained conscious. He was in severe pain and could'nt tell a continuing story. Through different questions, he gave the following story in segments.\n\"\"A white man drove up in a car, got out, walked up to car, shined flashlite inside and started shooting. Man was older than me, window was down. After stop shooting I got out of car, I tryed to get the people to come over but they drove off. After finally ten minutes the Policeman came.\"\"\nAt the time this subject was taken to I.C.U. this Off. left Kaiser returning to V.P.D. (Hoffman)\nPage 7: SUPPLEMENT - Vallejo Police Department\n- CASE NO. 243 146\n- 7-5-69 6AM - report written\n7-5-69 12:10AM - Rcvd call via KMA 818 that someone had been shot at in the vicinity of Blue Rock Springs & that the compl. would be waiting there. Operator gave detail to Off's Meyring & Lindemann in unit 119. RO also responded from the East side of town & upon arriving on Columbus Parkway in vicinity of golf course, observed detailed officers on a car stop. Off. Meyring advised they stopped the veh because it was in the area & that they were making P.I. reports. RO then proceeded to the parking lot on the E side of street at the park & noted that off. Hoffman was at the scene & a wht male subj. lying on the ground to the rt rear of a 1963 brn Chev. Corvair, 2dr, CRV 209. This subj. with blood all over his face & later identified as Michael R. Mageau, WM, 19 of 864 Beechwood. Prior to getting out of the unit Off. Hoffman requested I return to car stop of Off. Meyring & Lindemann & have them hold the subj's they had stopped. RO proceeded back to carstop & instructed officers to arrest the two subj's, a WM & WF for investigation of felony, & make a search of their veh. RO then returned to Off. Hoffman.\nOn initial arrival, RO requested by radio an ambulance & an investigator at the scene & upon returning to Off. Hoffman RO went to assistance of subj. on ground, as Off. Hoffman was with a subj that was sitting on left front seat behind wheel that was also injured. This subj. later identified as Darlene E. Ferrin, WF, 19, of 864 Beechwood.\nOn prelimanary examination of Mageau, it was apparent that he had been shot a number of times, he had blood all over his face & blood coming from his mouth as well as his left leg with blood. RO felt it was necessary to question subj. inspight of the fact the subj. was in great pain. Subj. was coherent & RO asked him, \"\"do you know who shot you?\"\" & he replied \"\"no\"\". RO then asked Mageau to give me some type of description & he replied that he can't. RO then asked a series of question & was told by Mageau that the resp. was a wht male, young, & heavy set by himself & that he was in a brown veh. RO then asked if the resp. said anything & Mageau replied, \"\"no, he just started shooting & kept shooting.\"\" Questioning continued until arrival of ambulance at which time both veh. was placed in ambulance & removed from the scene. By this time Sgt's Rust, Lynch & Odiorne had arrived at the scene & RO gave them the information obtained from the victim & gave a description over the air to all units. It was at this time it was determined that Sgt's Lynch & Rust would be the investigating officers & the investigation was then turned over to them.\nRO then left the scene upon being advised by radio that the possible resp. had called the station from a pay phone at the corner of Tuolumne & Springs Rd. RO proceeded to that location to cover the detailed unit 122, Off's Agenbroad & Pegg. Upon arriving at that location it was determined resp. was not at that location & the detailed off's were instructed to stand by until an I.D. technician could get there to check for prints. (Conway)\nPage 8: SUPPLEMENT - Vallejo Police Department\n- CASE NO. 243146\n- CRIME CLASSIFICATION: Murder\n- 7-6-69 3:00 PM\n- Location: Intensive Care Unit, Kaiser Hospital\nRO went to location and contacted shooting victim, Michael Mageau. Was advised by Dr. Scott that RO could talk to him for a short time, however he was under medication at this time and would possibly be going to sleep shortly. RO contacted Michael who still was in very bad condition and was very strained to talk as he had had a wound in his mouth. RO asked him if he could as best as possible relate the facts as he knew them as to the occurrences of Friday night when he and D. FERRIN were shot. Michael states that he would do his best to give a statement and gave it as following.\nStates that at approximately 4:00p.m. Friday afternoon, that D. Ferrin called him up, and in their conversation stated they agreed that they would go to a movie in San Francisco that night and she would be at the house at approximately 7:30 p.m. Michael states he next heard from her at approximately 8:00p.m. when she again called and stated that she had to go with her sister, Christine, to the Miss Firecracker contest, that she would call him as soon as she could, as soon as she was clear from this. Michael states that he stayed home and at approx. 10:30 he received another call from Dea stating she would be over shortly. He stated that Dea came over at approximately 11:30 or shortly thereafter and picked him up in her car. They were both hungry as they had not had supper and were going to go get something to eat. Stated that she was driving her vehicle, the Corvair they were found in. Stated they drove west on Springs Road and as they were driving down Springs Road to go get something to eat, Dea stated to him that she wanted to talk to him about something. Michael stated that approximately at the location of Mr. Ed's on Springs Road they turned around and headed east at his suggestion to go to Blue Rock Springs Park where they could talk. They went directly out to this location, pulled the car in the parking lot where it was found by the police. Dea turned the lights and the motor off and had the radio playing. States they were there just a very short time, a few minutes, and three cars pulled in to the parking lot where they were. They were apparently young kids, and they heard some laughing and carrying on and a few firecrackers were set off, then the three vehicles left within a short time. This was just a very short space of time, a few minutes. Shortly after this and about five minutes before the shooting occurred, Michael states a vehicle pulled into the lot, coming from the direction of Springs Road and Vallejo. The driver turned the lights off on the car and pulled around to the left or east side of their car, approximately six or eight feet away and sat there for a minute. Michael states he asked Ded if she knew who it was and she stated, \"\"Oh, never mind.\"\" Michael stated at this time he is always kidding Dea about knowing so many people and does not know whether she meant this as she knew the fellow or not. Michael states as best as he can recall, he could not see the car too clearly, however the shape of the car looked similar to the car that Dea owns, a Corvair. He could not see the color or anything as it was very dark out there.\nEd Rust\nPage 9: SUPPLEMENT - Vallejo Police Department\n- CASE NO. 243146\n- CRIME CLASSIFICATION: Murder\nStates as far as he could tell this car had one male subject in it. The car then drove off and headed in the direction of Vallejo & Springs Road at a fairly fast rate of speed. He stated approximately five minutes later, the vehicle pulled up, coming from the direction of Vallejo & Springs Road. This vehicle pulled up approximately ten feet behind and to the right side of Dea's car, which would be the side that Michael was sitting. The vehicle's lights were left on and the subject got out and walked toward the car. He had a large high-powered flashlight, the kind you carry with a handle. This subject walked up to the car and Michael stated that both he and Dea believed that it was a policeman and that he wanted to check their I.D. or something. Stated subject stepped up to Michael's side of the car, which is the right side, shining the flashlight on them. Subject did not say anything to them, nor did they say anything to him. Michael stated he started to reach for his wallet as he felt it was a policeman who wanted to see his I.D. States as he did so, he heard a muffled sound and felt a pain in his back and his neck area. He states he heard some more muffled sounds, sounding like a gun with a silencer on it, and felt pains in his body, his back and around his neck. States he tried to climb over the back seat to get away from the shooting and subject kept shooting him again and again. States finally the subject quit shooting him and apparently turned the gun on Dea and started shooting her again and again. States subject then turned around and started to walk back to his vehicle which still had the headlights on. Michael stated he could not tell if he meant to yell at the subject or if he just yelled from pain, but he let out some type of yell. At this time, the subject apparently hearing him, came back to the car and shot Michael two more times, once in the back and once in the left leg. States the subject then turned the gun on Dea and shot her twice more. Michael states that all the shots that he heard were muffled, sounding similar to a gun with the silencer on. It was not loud. States the subject then turned around and casually walked back to his vehicle and got in. Michael at this time stated that he had to reach outside the car door to open it as the handle inside was broken. Stated he reached outside and opened the car door and fell outside on the ground. As he fell out onto the ground the vehicle the subject was in backed up in a turning movement and then took off toward Springs Road in Vallejo at a very high rate of speed. Michael states as the vehicle drove off he only saw the rear portion of it, this rear part appearing to be a vehicle similar to or the same type as Dea's car, a Corvair. Also a very similar color, possibly a little bit lighter brown. It had a California license, however he could not tell what the numbers were.

Jerry and Roger gave the following statement: They, along with Debbie and in Debbie's vehicle (Rambler brown in color) had been downtown to see the festivities for the 4th of July. After this was over, at about 11pm, they decided to look for this girl that Roger knows. They drove around town and did not see her and decided to go to Blue Rock Park to look for her. They went out the freeway to Columbus Parkway and came in to the Park the back way. While they were driving in toward the Park neither boy recalls seeing any vehicle coming out, none parked along the road, nor did they pass any vehicle. When they came to the park area it was dark and they looked for any vehicles. The only one they saw was the victims brown Corvair, same was parked in location as found by the police. They stated that when first observed the Corvair did not have any lites on. Debbie stopped the car in the road and they were trying to decide to go check the vehicle to see if Roger's girl was in it when the lites came on. They thought the occupants were going to leave and then thought they heard someone scream. Debbie backed up her car and turned to shine her high beams onto the car and then they saw a male subject on the ground beside the passenger side of the Corvair, door was open. The male was rolling around on the ground and screaming. Debbie then pulled her car up behind the Corvair and Jerry jumped out and ran up to the male and asked \"\"are you all right?\"\" and the male said \"\"I'm shot and the girl's shot, get a doc.\"\" Jerry said \"\"All right we'll get one\"\", and the male said \"\"hurry\"\". Roger had jumped out of the car also and heard this talk. Neither of them looked in the Corvair and didn't see the girl. Then Jerry wanted to stay there while Debra and Roger went to get a doctor, but they insisted he come with them. They got back in the car and all three drove toward Springs Rd. in Vallejo and the only vehicle they saw on the drive in was a vehicle's tail lites on the Lake Herman Road turnoff. The vehicle was too far off to tell what kind it was or if it was going fast. All they could tell was that it was headed away from them. They then proceeded into Vallejo and went to 938 Castlewood, Jerry's home and called police to report what they had seen. They all three waited there a short while and then went to Debbie's brother-in-law, Bob [redacted], house, he being a policeman. They were afraid the police would think it was just a hoax.

She could offer very little background information on Phillips and was not in fact around him for any great period of time. Mother stated Darlene had left the family home on Nov. 25, 1965. This happened after a family dispute. The family did not hear from her again until Oct. 1966 when she returned home with her husband, James D. Phillips.

As far as family knows no further contact between Darlene and Phillips except she contacted him in San Francisco to have him sign some papers pertaining to their divorce.

Hoffman\nApprox. 12:10am 7-5-69 writter copied a radio message from KMA 818 regarding two teenagers being shot at in the area of Blue Rock Springs. R.O. had just checked this area approx. 15 min. prior to this transmission, and found the parking lot of Blue Rock Springs clear of people or motor vehicles.\nProceeding to the above area, driving V.P.D. unit 130, and following unit 119. Observed unit 119 make a U-turn on Columbus Parkway just south of the Blue Rock Springs Golf Course.

But did view a substantial amount of blood splatered about the car. This subject was later I.D. as Darlene ELIZABETH FERRIN WFA 22yrs. DOB 3-17-47 residing at 930 Montery, Vlo.\nAt this point Sgt.

And in fact detain Andy [redacted] Jr. for further investigation as to the responsibility of this crime.\nOff. D.

Hoffman\nPrior to the arrival of the ambulance, R.O. searched the area of the parking lot in which the victims vehicle was standing. This search discovered what appeared to be seven(7) empty shell caseings. These caseings bore the caliber on the base of the shell, that being a 9mm. These caseings belived to have been ejected from an automatic pistol. The seven (7) empty shells were found a few feet away from the victims auto on the right side. All of these shell cases have been taged into evidence under this case number.\nSolano ambulance arrived and transported the victims to Kaiser Hosp. Writter rode with the victims enroute to the hosp.

These items of clothing were received by R.O. and placed into evidence under this case number.\nDuring the time MAGEAU was being treated for his wounds he remained conscious. He was in severe pain and could'nt tell a continuing story. Through different questions, he gave the following story in segments.\n\"\"A white man drove up in a car, got out, walked up to car, shined flashlite inside and started shooting. Man was older than me, window was down. After stop shooting I got out of car, I tryed to get the people to come over but they drove off. After finally ten minutes the Policeman came.\"\"\nAt the time this subject was taken to I.C.U. this Off. left Kaiser returning to V.P.D. (Hoffman)\nPage 7: SUPPLEMENT - Vallejo Police Department\n- CASE NO. 243 146\n- 7-5-69 6AM - report written\n7-5-69 12:10AM - Rcvd call via KMA 818 that someone had been shot at in the vicinity of Blue Rock Springs & that the compl. would be waiting there. Operator gave detail to Off's Meyring & Lindemann in unit 119. RO also responded from the East side of town & upon arriving on Columbus Parkway in vicinity of golf course, observed detailed officers on a car stop. Off. Meyring advised they stopped the veh because it was in the area & that they were making P.I. reports. RO then proceeded to the parking lot on the E side of street at the park & noted that off.

RO proceeded back to carstop & instructed officers to arrest the two subj's, a WM & WF for investigation of felony, & make a search of their veh. RO then returned to Off. Hoffman.\nOn initial arrival, RO requested by radio an ambulance & an investigator at the scene & upon returning to Off. Hoffman RO went to assistance of subj. on ground, as Off. Hoffman was with a subj that was sitting on left front seat behind wheel that was also injured. This subj. later identified as Darlene E.

RO felt it was necessary to question subj. inspight of the fact the subj. was in great pain. Subj. was coherent & RO asked him, \"\"do you know who shot you?\"\" & he replied \"\"no\"\". RO then asked Mageau to give me some type of description & he replied that he can't. RO then asked a series of question & was told by Mageau that the resp. was a wht male, young, & heavy set by himself & that he was in a brown veh. RO then asked if the resp. said anything & Mageau replied, \"\"no, he just started shooting & kept shooting.\"\" Questioning continued until arrival of ambulance at which time both veh. was placed in ambulance & removed from the scene. By this time Sgt's Rust, Lynch & Odiorne had arrived at the scene & RO gave them the information obtained from the victim & gave a description over the air to all units. It was at this time it was determined that Sgt's Lynch & Rust would be the investigating officers & the investigation was then turned over to them.\nRO then left the scene upon being advised by radio that the possible resp. had called the station from a pay phone at the corner of Tuolumne & Springs Rd. RO proceeded to that location to cover the detailed unit 122, Off's Agenbroad & Pegg. Upon arriving at that location it was determined resp. was not at that location & the detailed off's were instructed to stand by until an I.D. technician could get there to check for prints. (Conway)\nPage 8: SUPPLEMENT - Vallejo Police Department\n- CASE NO. 243146\n- CRIME CLASSIFICATION: Murder\n- 7-6-69 3:00 PM\n- Location: Intensive Care Unit, Kaiser Hospital\nRO went to location and contacted shooting victim, Michael Mageau. Was advised by Dr. Scott that RO could talk to him for a short time, however he was under medication at this time and would possibly be going to sleep shortly. RO contacted Michael who still was in very bad condition and was very strained to talk as he had had a wound in his mouth. RO asked him if he could as best as possible relate the facts as he knew them as to the occurrences of Friday night when he and D. FERRIN were shot. Michael states that he would do his best to give a statement and gave it as following.\nStates that at approximately 4:00p.m. Friday afternoon, that D. Ferrin called him up, and in their conversation stated they agreed that they would go to a movie in San Francisco that night and she would be at the house at approximately 7:30 p.m. Michael states he next heard from her at approximately 8:00p.m. when she again called and stated that she had to go with her sister, Christine, to the Miss Firecracker contest, that she would call him as soon as she could, as soon as she was clear from this. Michael states that he stayed home and at approx. 10:30 he received another call from Dea stating she would be over shortly. He stated that Dea came over at approximately 11:30 or shortly thereafter and picked him up in her car. They were both hungry as they had not had supper and were going to go get something to eat. Stated that she was driving her vehicle, the Corvair they were found in. Stated they drove west on Springs Road and as they were driving down Springs Road to go get something to eat, Dea stated to him that she wanted to talk to him about something. Michael stated that approximately at the location of Mr. Ed's on Springs Road they turned around and headed east at his suggestion to go to Blue Rock Springs Park where they could talk. They went directly out to this location, pulled the car in the parking lot where it was found by the police. Dea turned the lights and the motor off and had the radio playing. States they were there just a very short time, a few minutes, and three cars pulled in to the parking lot where they were. They were apparently young kids, and they heard some laughing and carrying on and a few firecrackers were set off, then the three vehicles left within a short time. This was just a very short space of time, a few minutes. Shortly after this and about five minutes before the shooting occurred, Michael states a vehicle pulled into the lot, coming from the direction of Springs Road and Vallejo. The driver turned the lights off on the car and pulled around to the left or east side of their car, approximately six or eight feet away and sat there for a minute. Michael states he asked Ded if she knew who it was and she stated, \"\"Oh, never mind.\"\" Michael stated at this time he is always kidding Dea about knowing so many people and does not know whether she meant this as she knew the fellow or not. Michael states as best as he can recall, he could not see the car too clearly, however the shape of the car looked similar to the car that Dea owns, a Corvair. He could not see the color or anything as it was very dark out there.\nEd Rust\nPage 9: SUPPLEMENT - Vallejo Police Department\n- CASE NO. 243146\n- CRIME CLASSIFICATION: Murder\nStates as far as he could tell this car had one male subject in it. The car then drove off and headed in the direction of Vallejo & Springs Road at a fairly fast rate of speed. He stated approximately five minutes later, the vehicle pulled up, coming from the direction of Vallejo & Springs Road. This vehicle pulled up approximately ten feet behind and to the right side of Dea's car, which would be the side that Michael was sitting. The vehicle's lights were left on and the subject got out and walked toward the car. He had a large high-powered flashlight, the kind you carry with a handle. This subject walked up to the car and Michael stated that both he and Dea believed that it was a policeman and that he wanted to check their I.D. or something. Stated subject stepped up to Michael's side of the car, which is the right side, shining the flashlight on them. Subject did not say anything to them, nor did they say anything to him. Michael stated he started to reach for his wallet as he felt it was a policeman who wanted to see his I.D. States as he did so, he heard a muffled sound and felt a pain in his back and his neck area. He states he heard some more muffled sounds, sounding like a gun with a silencer on it, and felt pains in his body, his back and around his neck. States he tried to climb over the back seat to get away from the shooting and subject kept shooting him again and again. States finally the subject quit shooting him and apparently turned the gun on Dea and started shooting her again and again. States subject then turned around and started to walk back to his vehicle which still had the headlights on. Michael stated he could not tell if he meant to yell at the subject or if he just yelled from pain, but he let out some type of yell. At this time, the subject apparently hearing him, came back to the car and shot Michael two more times, once in the back and once in the left leg. States the subject then turned the gun on Dea and shot her twice more. Michael states that all the shots that he heard were muffled, sounding similar to a gun with the silencer on. It was not loud. States the subject then turned around and casually walked back to his vehicle and got in. Michael at this time stated that he had to reach outside the car door to open it as the handle inside was broken. Stated he reached outside and opened the car door and fell outside on the ground. As he fell out onto the ground the vehicle the subject was in backed up in a turning movement and then took off toward Springs Road in Vallejo at a very high rate of speed. Michael states as the vehicle drove off he only saw the rear portion of it, this rear part appearing to be a vehicle similar to or the same type as Dea's car, a Corvair. Also a very similar color, possibly a little bit lighter brown. It had a California license, however he could not tell what the numbers were. Stated the subject continued on Blue Rock Springs Road at a very high rate of speed towards Springs Road in Vallejo.\nMichael states that in what seemed to be eight to ten minutes after this a car came by with three young hippy types in it. He can recall two boys and one girl. States he waved and yelled to the occupants of this vehicle to come over and help him. Stated they came close to him\nEd Rust\nPage 10: SUPPLEMENT - Vallejo Police Department\n- CASE NO. 243146\n- CRIME CLASSIFICATION: Murder\nand he asked them to get a doctor quick. Stated the girl told him to lie still and they would get a doctor. States approximately five to ten minutes later the police arrived in a vehicle that was not a black and white police car and other policemen arrived, and he was then taken to the hospital.\nRO asked Michael if he could give a description of the responsible subject, and he stated as best as he could recall the description is as follows. Subject appeared to be short, possibly 5'8\"\", was real heavy set, beefy build. States subject was not blubbery fat, but real beefy, possibly 195 to 200, or maybe even larger. Stated he had short curly hair, light brown, almost blond. He was wearing a short-sleeved shirt, blue in color. Cannot remember if it was light or dark blue. States he just saw subject's face from the profile, side view, and does not recall seeing a front view. States there was nothing unusual about his face, other than it appeared to be large. Michael stated the subject did not have a mustache, nor was he wearing glasses or anything. He could not recall anything unusual except that he had a large face. Michael reemphasized that he really did not get a good look at subject other than his profile. Also, it was dark out and it was hard to see the subject.\nMichael states that he could possibly recognize responsible if he had a profile view, as this is the best view he had of the subject. Stated subject was a white male, approximately 26-30 years. Was unable to judge real well what his age was. States he feels sure the subject wanted to make sure that they were dead. This due to the fact that he returned and shot each one of them twice again after the first shooting.\nWhen questioned about Dea's vehicle having the headlights on when the police arrived, Michael was unable to explain fully, however states he recalls something about possibly flashing the lights on and off to attract attention of passing vehicles. States he cannot remember if he did this or possibly Dea did it. States while still in the car he called to Dea, does not recall what he said, but recalls the only thing that she was able to do was make a small moaning sound. She was unable to say anything.\nRO questioned Michael as to a possible motive, if he had had any argument or trouble, etc. with anyone recently, or if there was any reason at all that anyone would want to harm him. He stated he could not recall anything at all, having any arguments or anything to give anyone reason to do anything like this. Also st1ated that Darlene did not say anything about any trouble that she has had. States they have always been very truthful with each other and confided very closely in each other's problems and he is sure if she had known about someone after her or had a hate for her enough to do something like this, she would have said something about it. States as far as he knows, the only type of trouble that Dea has had was sometimes her friends got mad at her. There were sometimes petty jealousies between her and her friends.\nRust\nPage 11: SUPPLEMENT - Vallejo Police Department\n- CASE NO. 243 146\n- CRIME CLASSIFICATION: Murder\nSometimes some possibly boyfriends, not exactly dating type boyfriends, but friends, just acquaintances, would become jealous over just petty incidents.\nThe interview of Michael MAGEAU was terminated by RO at this time as he was becoming very tired due to the medication and also his condition due to the gunshot wounds. RO wishes to emphasize that throughout the entire interview with Michael it was a very strained situation for him as he had been given a sedative type of medication to relax him and put him to sleep and he was straining to keep himself awake in order to give the information to RO. RO advised him to rest at this time and when he woke up if he felt better and if he felt he possibly could give more information to have the nurse call RO at the police department.

Mrs. Suennen stated he worked in this capacity for approximately three weeks. (Phillips in fact worked five days and did not show up for work again.) Shortly after leaving the paper both Darlene and Phillips left Vallejo and went to Pennsylvania. They spent several months in Pennsylvania and returned to Vallejo. Their marriage was going poorly and Darlene decided to go to Reno and get a divorce. James apparently did not want a divorce but did not contest same. Records show final decree obtained in Reno on June 2, 1967. Shortly afterwards Darlene remarried and Phillips moved to San Francisco. As far as family knows no further contact between Darlene and Phillips except she contacted him in San Francisco to have him sign some papers pertaining to their divorce. Family had no further contact with Phillips until he attended the funeral of Darlene and was seen by two members of the family sitting in the back row during funeral services. He was with an unknown WFA who was pregnant at the time. There was no conversation between Phillips and family.\nMr. DeLouise had indicated to RO that Mrs. Suennen had told him that Phillips was at one time committed to a mental hospital. RO asked her if this was a fact and Mrs. Suennen stated she had \"\"heard\"\" this but did not know it to be a fact. She was also questioned concerning any particular interest Phillips might have had in astrology or cryptograms.

characters—but presented unfamiliar symbols not seen in earlier Zodiac ciphers, leading some to question its authenticity. When the FBI released the letter and cipher in 2007 through its Vault, they confirmed its postmark and stated that their cryptanalysts had interpreted the decrypted message to include the phrase: “Albany Medical Center. This is only the beginning.”\n\nThat phrase has been cited in multiple investigations and forums as evidence that the letter may be genuine, matching the Zodiac’s flair for ominous predictions. Still, handwriting analysis did not conclusively match the confirmed Zodiac letters, and the cipher’s structure diverged from prior patterns. As a result, the Albany letter remains a point of contention: a potential last communication or simply an echo.\n\nThe FBI did not officially authenticate the letter as a confirmed Zodiac communication. However, they took it seriously enough to include it in their formal case files. The Bureau’s Cryptanalysis and Racketeering Records Unit decoded the message, and agents investigated the threat in real time. To this day, the Albany letter remains one of the few post-1971 Zodiac-linked correspondences the FBI chose to retain in its files, even as its authorship remains disputed.\n\",1,1,1,1973-08-01,1973-08-01,Albany Times-Union,The Albany Letter,Fact,https://www.johnbulmermedia.com/2025/04/the-albany-zodiac-letter.html,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"errorType\"\": \"\"emptyDependency\"\", \"\"isStale\"\": false, \"\"state\"\": \"\"error\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2026-02-15T17:19:09.000Z,true,\"Albany, NY\",the-albany-letter,90,recFT7BcIqRXittfV,,,,\nrecgRiAW8CmrP7W6J,The Eureka Christmas Card,1990-12-01,,recyAymRgxnrLtPne,,,\"recGZwp9mtC6qB9Hd,rec5NLNj8q2bpKjm8,recg462dI0mJi8KMB\",,\"image.png (data/media/attVGM7MChVSsposC_image.png),image.png (data/media/attcFq5ot6aPDNWH9_image.png),image.png (data/media/attFFAd0sl8erauwD_image.png),image.png (data/media/attaUDjqs8wfO2IGz_image.png)\",,recf57VlN6FoqRqc5,recqHvlmSyXK7UYJo,1990,December,Saturday,,Disputed Z Communication,1990-12-01T00:00:00.000Z,12/1/1990,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=The%20Eureka%20Christmas%20Card&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=The%20Eureka%20Christmas%20Card&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2025-09-25T05:11:13.000Z,,,1990-12-01T00:00:00.000Z,\"image.png (data/media/att3216dHBIGXxA09_image.png),image.png (data/media/attvG3gM6PcIknM8n_image.png),image.png (data/media/att1uEt2ERt3fB0oO_image.png),image.png (data/media/attEciTA5hGZJkSVm_image.png)\",\"Title: The Eureka Christmas Card\n\nDate: 1990-12-01T00:00:00.000Z\n\nAuthor / Source: Zodiac, Chester Clark Klingel Jr.\n\nOrigin / Postmark: \"\"Eureka, CA\"\"\n\nEvents: The Eureka Christmas Card\n\nRelated People / Groups: \n\nTags: \n\nLocations: \n\nSource: \n\nText: \n\",3,1,1,1990-12-01,1990-12-01,\"Zodiac, San Francisco Chronicle, Chester Clark Klingel Jr.\",The Eureka Christmas Card,Fact,null,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2026-02-15T17:19:09.000Z,true,\"Eureka, CA\",the-eureka-christmas-card,91,recgRiAW8CmrP7W6J,,,,\nrecFRWQn7SW8hUN5d,Chester Klingel Jr. DNA tested,2007-10-15,,recURm55M69p21vYN,,,\"rec5ZMZlwchZ0IHSr,recg462dI0mJi8KMB\",,,,,,2007,October,Monday,,Suspect Event,2007-10-15T00:00:00.000Z,10/15/2007,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Chester%20Klingel%20Jr.%20DNA%20tested&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Chester%20Klingel%20Jr.%20DNA%20tested&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2025-09-25T07:07:23.000Z,,,2007-10-15T00:00:00.000Z,\"image.png (data/media/attMMGw7SEBStUUB2_image.png),image.png (data/media/attfiFBjIP3L2GXuT_image.png),image.png (data/media/attHSIteipj3Zv3Ex_image.png)\",,2,0,0,,,\"Vallejo Police, Chester Clark Klingel Jr.\",,Fact,,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2026-02-15T17:19:09.000Z,true,\"Vallejo, CA\",chester-klingel-jr-dna-tested,92,recFRWQn7SW8hUN5d,,,,\nrecmykb8A3bfWtx1h,Chester Klingel Jr. promoted to message center chief in US Army,1950-03-13,,reccc9Tca5aOazOhG,\"Via <https://www.strictly-gi.com/wwii-mos-database/674-message-center-chief/>\n\n# **Message Center Chief (674)**\n# **_Enlisted Personnel_**\n(Specification Serial Number 667 will be used for Message Center Chief assigned to units below a division.)\nDirects and coordinates all phases of message center operations at a divisional or higher level to insure the transmission of all messages with the utmost speed, accuracy, and security.

The two offered no resistence although they still carried the stolen pistol.\n> \n> The Bonner County Sheriff's office here said David Finch, 28, and Raymond Lee Wilson, 27, were in jail here. The two were among 12 who fled a prison farm near the Montana penitentiary at Deer Lodge July 15.

When the couple became suspicious, the convict pulled a knife, bound and gagged the pair and took their .22 caliber pistol and car. Near Sandpoint, the Yates' car ran out of gasoline and the two convicts commandeered a car belonging to Michael Winslow, Sandpoint, and forced him at gunpoint to drive toward Sandpoint. An argument developed at a service station between the convicts and Winslow over the pumping of gasoline, deputies said, and Winslow was shot in the forearm. The convicts then fled in the wounded man's car.\n> \n> POLICE CHASE\n> The two convicts were spotted by Sandpoint City Policeman Willard Piehl who gave chase and alerted other officers.

Reporting Officer John Robertson, Det/Sgt., interviewed one of two victims who were each stabbed numerous times by an unknown assailant. Victim CECELIA SHEPARD and victim BRYAN HARTNELL both had been placed in the Queen of the Valley Hospital intensive care unit. Victim SHEPARD had surgery performed on her earlier in the morning (9/28/69) and was unable to be questioned by the Reporting Officer, however Dr. Ludwig gave permission for victim HARTNELL to be interviewed.\nAlthough victim HARTNELL was heavily sedated, he was able to give R/O a verbal statement. (Note: R/O taped electrically the interview with victim HARTNELL.) Victim HARTNELL related the following.\nHe had known CECELIA SHEPARD for some time, they were good friends, and she had come to the Napa County area to spend the weekend. She and a female companion, DALORA LEE, Aspen, Loma Linda, San Bernardino County, Calif. (phone Ext. 2155) had driven from Southern California and were to drive back Sunday, 9/28/69. Victim stated he and MISS SHEPARD drove to Lake Berryessa, picked a large tree near the shore line where they decided to lie down and enjoy the scenery. While lying on the ground, victim HARTNELL stated he heard a noise and asked MISS SHEPARD if she could hear anything or see anything behind a tree not far from where the couple were lying. MISS SHEPARD told victim HARTNELL she could see a man behind the tree. HARTNELL asked her what he was doing. MISS SHEPARD stated she couldn't tell. HARTNELL stated he (suspect) then came from behind the tree. MISS SHEPARD said, \"\"Oh my God, he has a gun!\"\"\nVictim HARTNELL stated the man approached the couple, aiming a black steel automatic pistol. The suspect stated he needed a car and money. Suspect stated his car was \"\"hot\"\" and he wanted victim HARTNELL's car keys. Victim HARTNELL stated he began talking with the suspect, telling the suspect he had no money, only a small amount of change, also that if the suspect was really in need of assistance HARTNELL would attempt to help him. The suspect told victim to get on the ground. Suspect then had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him. HARTNELL stated he attempted to keep the suspect engaged in conversation while suspect was tying the victims.\nHARTNELL further stated the suspect was described as follows: Wearing a black hooded mask (cloth), covering suspect's entire head and shoulders, coming down almost to suspect's waist. Victim stated on front of the four-cornered type mask (similar to paper bag in style) there was a symbol, the symbol described as white, approximately 3 x 3 inches in diameter, with a symmetrical cross. Also on the eyelets of the mask was a pair of clip-on sunglasses, the glasses clipped to the eyelets. Victim stated he could also see hair through the mask's eyelets and observed the hair to be dark brown.\nVictim stated suspect was wearing a light-weight windbreaker, dark blue or black, pleated slacks (old-fashioned type). Victim could not remember what type of shoes or anything about suspect's hands, could not remember if suspect was wearing gloves.\nVictim thought suspect was possibly 20 to 30 years of age by voice concept. Victim stated suspect was 5'8\"\" to 6', 225-250 lbs., dark brown hair, eyes unknown, sloppy dresser, stomach hanging over trousers. Suspect spoke with some\n(2)\ntype of drawl, but victim stated it was not a Southern drawl, did not really know what type of drawl, but thought the man was not well educated, but did not feel he was illiterate either. Victim said suspect's voice was moderate in sound, that is, not high or low pitched.\nSuspect told victim he was sent to (?) Lodge State Prison (possibly Deer Lodge State Prison), Montana, for a killing. While there (in prison) he killed a guard while escaping. Suspect also told victims he was heading for Mexico, told victim he was flat broke.\nVictim observed cut-up rope in suspect's rear pocket (trouser's), also stated he was wearing a knife in a case (on belt) on his right side, near front of trousers. Knife description: Appeared to be a long bread knife, 12\"\" long blade, 3/4\"\" wide, hardwood handle, 2 brass rivets holding handle in place, cotton surgical tape wrapped approximately 1\"\" around handle of knife. Knife case possibly made of wood.\nVictim asked suspect if suspect's gun was loaded. Suspect removed magazine from handle of pistol and showed victim a bullet removed from gun, bullet described as a possible .45 caliber. Victim did not know what caliber the pistol was.\nSuspect had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him, suspect then tied victim SHEPARD's hands, then re-tied HARTNELL's hands, then tied both victims' ankles together, had victims lie on their stomachs. HARTNELL stated suspect said, \"\"I'm getting nervous.\"\" This was when suspect was tying MISS SHEPARD'S hands, in fact HARTNELL stated suspect got real shaky when he was tying MISS SHEPARD's hands.\nVictim HARTNELL then stated that without warning the suspect plunged his knife into the back of HARTNELL. Suspect did this repeatedly, HARTNELL stated he thinks six times. HARTNELL stated he pretended to be dead and the suspect went over to MISS SHEPARD and stabbed MISS SHEPARD repeatedly in the back, and when MISS SHEPARD turned her body over (on back), suspect stabbed her in the lower abdomen. Victim stated suspect stabbed MISS SHEPARD much worse than him. Suspect went into some sort of frenzy when stabbing MISS SHEPARD.\nVictim HARTNELL stated suspect left the area after the stabbing. Victim HARTNELL hailed a boat (off shore) and told the man in the boat the couple needed help badly. Victim stated the boat left the area and he (victim) attempted to get help by crawling and walking to the road. (Victim believed he had walked to the road, however had not gone too far from his wounded companion.)\nVictim stated he thought suspect had been with the couple for approximately fifteen (15) minutes from time of observing suspect until suspect departed.

ROBERTSON stated that Mr. HARTNELL was heavily sedated but was able to give a verbal statement pertaining to the attack at Lake Berrysessa. The interview was taped and reads as follows:\n\"\"INTERVIEW OF JOHN ROBERTSON, DET/SGT., NAPA COUNTY SHERIFF's DEPARTMENT, WITH BRYAN CALVIN HARTNELL (NSO CASE #105907) AT QUEEN OF THE VALLEY HOSPITAL ON SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1969 (TRANSCRIBED FROM TAPE RECORDING BY M. FEURLE):\n\"\"J.R. Can you give me this fellow's description and tell me what happened?\n\"\"B.H. So many people have been asking me... I hope...\n\"\"J.R. Well sometimes when we're repetitious, I know it happens to me, I tell the same thing over and over and over, and sometimes I might vary a little, and if you do...\n\"\"B.H. Shall I just start out and tell you what happened?\n\"\"J.R. I don't want to tire you out.\n\"\"B.H. I just don't want this to happen again to anybody... Of course he might have his reasons, I don't know...\n\"\"J.R. Okay. Go right ahead. Start right from the beginning. What happened?\n\"\"B.H. Okay. This girl came out from school, I used to go with her two years ago, and she's now going to another school, and she came up to visit some friends and we were having dinner at the school cafeteria, and I said, 'Well, are you doing anything special this afternoon?' and she said, 'Why?', and I said, 'I don't know. We could go out and either go for a walk, go to San Francisco, or, you know, just...', 'cause we used to be good friends. We used to have a good friendship. And so it got too late by the time we got around to what we were going to do. We had to stop in St. Helena for a couple items and then we had to cart a couple kids home and stuff, and by the time we finally got around to it, it was getting late, and I thought going to San Francisco 'd rush you, you know, because by the time we got back for worship... And so we went out to Berryessa, and there was this one place I used to go out... we used to all the time, you know... and I couldn't find it. And so I figured Ah, forget it, and this looks like as good a place as any. So I parked the car, there were no other cars there. I had a Kharman Ghia, '56, white, with a black vinyl top, and it's in pretty\nPage 2\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n... \"\"good-looking shape. But we parked there on the road's edge and we talked Oh it must be about a quarter of a mile to down to the place where we went. We had... (unintelligible) peninsula, it's an an island I guess during the wetter season, You can see where it was levee... And so that looked like a lot... there was a big spreading tree up there. There were two of them, really, one was a little bigger than the other. We took the one that was out on the point.\n\"\"It was really beautiful out there. We were sitting on top... I lay down on my back and she lay down on her stomach beside me, you know, kind of resting her head on my shoulder, and we were talking, you know, kind of reminiscing about old times, and stuff. And I heard these rustling leaves, and I said, 'You have your specs on. Why don't you see what the deal is over there?' And she says, 'Oh, it's some man.' And I said, 'Is he alone?' and she said, 'Yeah... (unintelligible)...' and she says, 'Well he just stepped behind the tree.' And I said, 'What's the idea of that? To take a leak?' You know, 'cause that's the only thing I could think of, just step behind a tree. And so I says, 'Well, keep looking and tell me what happens,' and she says, 'Oh my God, he's got a gun!' and squeezed my arm and\n\"\"And so he came out, and of course still actually I wasn't... There's some things you really wouldn't mind having happen, just for the experience of it. You know I thought, Well I only got fifty cents on me. It's worth all of that having it happen. I didn't think about another angle. So I talked to him, you know. I said, 'Well listen, Mac, (you know I'm in the sociologist field, you know, I'm pre-law, with history and psych.) You know I've read about the criminal mind and everything, you know. I thought well maybe the guy really does need help, you know. I says, 'There's no strings attached.' I says, 'I don't have any money right now but if you need help that badly I can help you out in another way maybe.' And he says, 'Nah.. time's running short,' he says, ''cause I just got out of... some prison in Montana, I don't know what the name of it is. Feathers? Do you know what the name of it is? I'll see if it sounds familiar. Fern or Feathers? It's some double name, like Fern Lock or something...\n\"\"J.R. It's Lodge..\nPage 3\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. Oh yeah, yeah, Lodge. At least we know we're together on that.\n\"\"J.R. Mountain Lodge Prison, or something of that nature...\n\"\"B.H. Yeah. You know he said he broke out and had to kill a guard getting out. And I said, 'Well, man, I mean actually I don't mean to call your bluff or anything, but wouldn't you rather be stuck on a stealing charge than a threat of homicide?' you know? And he says, 'Well just don't start playing hero on me.' You know, 'Don't try to grab the gun,' 'cause I didn't really figure the gun was loaded. I always thought it would be empty. I've heard a lot of times that this is what they do just as a bluff, but I decided not to call his bluff after he really, you know... I told him, 'You know you're really wasting your time with me. I've got a billfold and this much change and that's it.' And he said, he told the girl, 'Go tie him up. I'd feel much better if you were tied up.' And she tied a couple of loose knots on me, so I made it look kind of tight... (unintelligible)... you know, just for a second, and he said 'Go ahead.' And I whispered to her, 'You know I think I can get that gun.' And I said, 'Do you mind?' and she got kind of fearful about it, so I figured since there's two lives involved, not just mine, I won't do it.\n\"\"So I let her tie me up on the wrists again, and he tied her up, - terribly tight, you know, real... (unintelligible) ... put his gun away, and we were talking and all, bantering, you know, basically. I was thinking, anything I can do to help, by the way just to keep the conversation going... Suddenly he was taking it all seriously, you know... So I was starting out and finally he said, 'Okay, lay down. I've got her tied up', you know... He strung a rope between our ankles in the rear, so we were like this, you know, on our stomachs, tied...\n\"\"J.R. You both facing the ground...\n\"\"B.H. Right. And, oh, this was before. I got sort of ahead. So anyway, he said, 'Get down,' and I said, 'Oh come on! We could freeze to death!' I said that a couple, three times, and he said, 'GET DOWN! RIGHT NOW!' He got a little pushed off at me. So I got down and then he finished tying her up and clonked her down, - and then he goes... Sswhooosh (a sound with his mouth)... (unintelligible)\nPage 4\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"And so I said, 'Do you have bullets in there?' And so he pulled out the clip and showed me that he did. The bullets were about this long, I can remember, and about this fat, and they had the regular red cap on it, about this long. Maybe that doesn't give you any better description of the gun or not. I don't know. And it came out of the heel, the grip, you know. It slipped out from the bottom.\n\"\"And now, to backtrack a bit. I was really trying to see what he looked like, you know. He had on pleated pants, these old type of suit pants, you know, and they were either black or dark blue, I can't remember now. And I can't remember what he was wearing for shoes. But he had on this cotton coat, You've seen the kind, that you just turn the collar up once, there's a zipper down the front, you know. They're real light, super-thin, you know...\n\"\"J.R. Kind of a windbreaker...\n\"\"B.H. Yeah, like a windbreaker. And it's got this blue, this little collar, sometimes the guys wear them standing up, you know.\n\"\"J.R. What color was that?\n\"\"B.H. That was dark blue. And I don't know. Maybe he had something in his pouch. I just took it as being a... as being a... you know, he was stout 'cause he looked kind of heavy. I think he was weighing two and a quarter, two fifty, somewhere in there. And I got kind of a look at his hair. His voice... I can remember... almost like I'd heard it before. You know there's some drawls that a lot of people have similar. And... almost as if I'd heard it before... couldn't think where.\n\"\"I gave that one up, I just gave it up on that angle. I looked through his hair. I kind of looked like it was combed, you know, like this.. it was a brownish, you know, dark brown hair.\n\"\"And this mask he had on. It was ingeniously devised. It was... he had four corners at the top, like the top of a paper sack... black. It came down, came down, with the front panel about to here, and a kind of a thing that came over the shoulders, you know, and then the same thing down the back, straight down. And in the front he had a circle with a symmetrical cross in the middle. You know what I mean by a symmetrical cross?\nPage 5\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. Um hum (affirmative).\n\"\"B.H. The ends of the cross hung out about this far on each of the... you know, where it came out. The circle was this much... like this... and then it was like this, you see... hung out on the end, over the edge of the circle.\n\"\"And he had clip-on sunglasses... it was hard to tell. You know, the sunglasses you clip on when you're wearing glasses, eyeglasses, He had those clipped on. I'm pretty sure... I don't think he had glasses, though. I think he just had these clipped on to his suit... you know, that little mask.\n\"\"And I don't know how tall he was. Maybe 5-8 or maybe 5-10, 6 feet, somewhere in there. I'm a very poor judge of height because of my height. I have no meaning, you know. It's always down, you know. It can never be up...\n\"\"And so I saw him put away his gun, and I was turning to say something to Celia, and all of a sudden I felt my back... just... no, I think I saw him pull it out.. I don't remember... I think I saw him whip out his knife and just start stabbing me in the back... CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP! I was just (makes a gutteral sound)... you know that kind of a sound... and Celia turned to see why I was (repeats gutteral sound), you know, and she just about fainted. She went hysterical... (unintelligible) ... and when he finally stopped... I mean he went over and... The doctor says there's six in the back, six wounds on my back. You ought to confirm that. One I've got went clear through the lung. I've got it draining. I did drain a couple pints of blood out as soon as I got here. I lost an awful lot of blood, I guess.\n\"\"We were down... I mean it was absolutely no question in my mind... when a person gets stabbed as many times as we did... we were going to die. I mean there'd be no reason to question it. But somehow I, you know, started (unintelligible)... I just knew there was too much I had to live for. I mean really it does happen... about getting depressed and everything... when you're young you always think about these things... you know you think about it... and when you've got someone forcing your hand, oh well, there was a lot of things I had to do. And what really kept me going... you know my parents are pretty Christian. I haven't been too much of a Christian myself... but if you believe in the principle you ask God to help you. Another thing, What was my only strength was knowing two things. One, that I did not want to die, and two, that I felt that whatever was\nPage 6\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n\"\"going to be was going to be, but I was going to try my damnedest to stay alive. And so, like I say, - before I left her I kissed her, and I said, 'Well,' I says, 'I'm gonna try to get help.'\n\"\"There was a boat kept circling around out there in the lake and we started yelling at it and finally it came within about 100 yards of the shore and turned off its motor and stayed there watching us for about fifteen minutes, and we were just screaming hysterically, trying to get their attention, you know, to come over here. Oh, I don't know, I guess they were afraid that the guy might be there in the bushes and they were liable to get choked or something. So finally he came up a little closer. I didn't have my glasses on... I was just swaying, you know... and I had gotten one of her hands free before they came, and so I kept trying to get her to untie me, and she couldn't, she was too weak, she said.\n\"\"So finally I just kept hollering and hollering, and she said, 'Turn around and let's see if I can do it again.' She finally got it. My hands and my feet were just pure numbness... they're still numb but I'm sure that will go 'way. But I finally got... (unintelligible)... untie her so she could kind of relax out. 'Cause it was a terrible position, you know, upon our stomachs... (unintelligible)...\n\"\"And so I started to go for help. I finally got myself fairly reconciled. I wasn't too worried about dying, if that was what was going to happen, but I knew I had to keep pushing on. I had to force myself into staying alive because it was... I could just see myself... you know, all sort of waves would come over... I just (coughing sound)... (unintelligible)... 'Well, you're not gonna give up this easy', you know. And, like I say, I just kept believing that God would do everything the best, if the thing was gonna happen, but I couldn't see any reason why my dying would be the best good. So I just played along with that.\n\"\"I just started to walk toward the road... everything blacked out on me... my visual... my mind was never blacked out, but my visual was. So I lay down... My eyes started to come open... I just saw a haze of trees, you know. In a little while I got up and went another twenty feet, and then the same thing happened... (unintelligible)... and sat down. Next thing I went clear... (unintelligible)... the road, and by that time I just fell... I just... I was trying so hard to go far I just went too far. Finally I heard this pickup\nPage 7\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"coming... I was just laying alongside the road, and that's where this guy picked me up.\n\"\"They weren't in any hurry at all, it didn't seem like, you know, but they finally called an ambulance. About fifteen minutes later it came... (unintelligible)... but I still believe... I've got feeling... starting to get a little pain to come through. But from the minute that knife blade went in, it was nothing but pure shock from there on. I just did not expect it. I didn't expect that he would do that. That was a variable I had completely left out. And I guess he just took off running after we started running. I don't know. I never saw him before and hope not to see him again... at least outside of a courtroom.\n\"\"It's hard for me to explain much more. I mean I'm trying to give you a kind of example of his technique. He had some rope cut up in his back pocket. And he had a ... well, I thought it was a police automatic because it was in one of these black leather cases, you know...\n\"\"J.R. Was it in a smooth case, or did it have a basket weave like..\n\"\"B.H. Can I have my glasses? Oh, they're not here. It was a smooth one, though.\n\"\"J.R. Did he have this hood down to about the middle of his chest?\n\"\"B.H. No, about like... well, I'll show you... Here... his stomach.. You know I could see his... (voice fades away)\n\"\"J.R. Okay. You said his hair looked dark brown. How could you see his hair?\n\"\"B.H. 'Cause I saw it from where those goggles fit. I looked so closely to find out. And when he turned you know they kind of flittered... I could see his hair. It looked kind of greasy.\n\"\"J.R. Now was he as heavy as I am?\n\"\"B.H. Well I can't say 'cause he wasn't wearing those type of clothes. They were sloppy clothes, you know. And he just had on this old pair of pleated pants. I don't know... How tall are you?\n\"\"J.R. I'm about five eleven.\nPage 8\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. Well, like I say, he was dressed kind of sloppily, you know. His pants real tight up here and his stomach kind of pouched a bit, you know. I don't know... it's hard to say 'cause I can't judge you with being in a suit and all, you know, and him not being professional-looking at all. He could be about the same. It's hard to say. He was so sloppily dressed.\n\"\"J.R. Bryan, you also mentioned a drawl. Well not a drawl, an accent.\n\"\"B.H. It was just something... I guess his way of talking. It was something I couldn't repeat. It's like a song. Sometimes you know what you're going to say but you just can't sing the melody worth a darn.\n\"\"J.R. Did he have a throaty voice or a high pitched?\n\"\"B.H. In between. But it was just a unique way of talking.\n\"\"J.R. Did he sound like an educated man?\n\"\"B.H. Heck no! I don't think so.\n\"\"J.R. Did he sound illiterate?\n\"\"B.H. No. He didn't sound that way either. He just impressed me as being rather low class. The reason was because of his clothes, you know.\n\"\"J.R. Did you lose consciousness when he stabbed you at any time? Did you observe him stab Cecelia?\n\"\"B.H. Yeah...\n\"\"J.R. What did he say after...\n\"\"B.H. He stabbed her a bunch of times in the back. After she turned around, he got her once in the groin and one in the arm I think. He kind of went a little more hog-wild with her than with me. I faked dead... like that... I didn't want him to come back and give me some more.\n\"\"J.R. So you were pretty sure he thought you were dead when he finished working on you?\nPage 9\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. I think he kind of thought that. Of course I don't know because we started talking right after he left. It's hard to say... (unintelligible)... I don't think she fainted either.\n\"\"J.R. Was she in a lot of pain, did she tell you?\n\"\"B.H. Oh yeah. She was more weak at the time... (unintelligible).. from the religious angle. I told her I sure as heck wasn't going to have any deathbed conversion. 'No,' she says... (unintelligible)... I mean it was just like you were gonna die and had a few things to say. But I felt more and more I wasn't losing strength as much... (unintelligible)... that I thought I could cope with...\n\"\"J.R. What you did was a courageous thing. It was a terrible thing to have happen to anyone.\n\"\"B.H. Well there was nothing we could do. We were kind of at the mercy of him. I mean I wanted to get that gun... (unintelligible)... There was a time I think I could have gotten it...\n\"\"J.R. Did it appear to be a .45 to you? An automatic?\n\"\"B.H. It was about this long... along the stock... and had a wood edge on it, you know.. on either side...\n\"\"J.R. Handles.\n\"\"B.H. Yeah...yeah...\n\"\"J.R. Did the bullet look anything like that?\n\"\"B.H. No. It was kind of like this, only it was gold, and this part here came out along with this and then round the gold, round the blunt end. Not quite that blunt-ended, though.\n\"\"J.R. Was it fat? Fatter than this?\n\"\"B.H. Yeah, I think it was a little fatter. But it was gold, you know. And I didn't see any of this here. There was a part where it crimped... Well, almost like that 22, short, only a lot bigger. It was about like this length, maybe more stubby.\nPage 10\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n\"\"J.R. Well I'll get a .45 a little later and we can bring it up and let you observe it.\n\"\"B.H. \"\"Let's take the suspect. His hands... I don't remember if they had gloves on or not. I can't remember now. I keep thinking that he had gloves on. I can't figure how he tied us... Let's ask Celia, she probably knows about that.\n\"\"J.R. Did he swear? Did he use any profane language or obscenity?\n\"\"B.H. I don't think so. If he did it was no more than I was using at the time. I don't think he used any obscenity. He might have used a swear word or something, you know. That wasn't striking to me...\n\"\"J.R. Do you have any idea what his motive might have been? Money?\n\"\"B.H. Money. He said he was going to go to Mexico and he was flat broke.\n\"\"J.R. Did he search you after he...\n\"\"B.H. Heck no! Very unprofessional. He didn't even end up taking that loose change and didn't even take my billfold.\n\"\"J.R. Why did he stab you when you weren't fighting him off or anything?\n\"\"B.H. I couldn't. Even if I'd have wanted to. I was laying on my stomach...\n\"\"J.R. So what would have been the purpose of him to stab you, do you think?\n\"\"B.H. Well I (unintelligible)...but I think he got rattled... (unintelligible)... very, very nervous. His hands were shaking... (unintelligible)... Are you nervous?\n\"\"J.R. I'm just curious. If you could write me that symbol you were telling me about. Do you think you could draw me a picture of that even without your glasses?\n\"\"B.H. Um hum (affirmative). (Draws)... kind of like that. I can't see very well...\nPage 11\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. Yes, I see. Okay...\n\"\"B.H. ... (unintelligible)... that I could really die...\n\"\"J.R. Does this ring a bell?\n\"\"B.H. This one here. This is more like it, but I'm not sure. It was distinctly that design. It was thick. More thick marks.\n\"\"J.R. Okay. What color was this? Do you recall?\n\"\"B.H. Black. And that was white.\n\"\"J.R. This was black.\n\"\"B.H. No, that was white. It was about this tall.\n\"\"J.R. Two and a half, three inches?\n\"\"B.H. About four by four... three by three...\n\"\"J.R. How do you feel? Am I tiring you out too much?\n\"\"B.H. No. I've had a couple shots. It's not hurting me at all.\n\"\"J.R. Do you think Cecelia could tell me any more than you have already told me? Add anything?\n\"\"B.H. (unintelligible)\n\"\"J.R. Did he slap you around? Slap her?\n\"\"B.H. (unintelligible)... No.\n\"\"J.R. He was a much smaller man than you?\n\"\"B.H. Not much. About your height I guess. I don't know.\n\"\"J.R. Well you're getting kind of sleepy. I'll ease up on you.\n\"\"B.H. Have you gotten any clues at all?\n\"\"J.R. Yes, we've got some good clues. Before we get this guy it's going to take a lot of work.\n\"\"B.H. Remember he said he was headed for Mexico,\nPage 12\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. He's headed for Mexico?\n\"\"B.H. That's what he said.\n\"\"J.R. I'll leave you my card. It's right up here. I'm going to go down and talk to your mom and dad.\n\"\"B.H. Have the news heard about this at all?\n\"\"J.R. Yes.\n\"\"B.H. Was there anything in the paper today?\n\"\"J.R. No, it wasn't in...\n\"\"B.H. The Napa paper?\n\"\"J.R. Well there's no Napa paper on Sundays. It's been on the news media...\n\"\"B.H. Names? Did they name my name?\n\"\"J.R. I don't know, to tell you the truth.\n\"\"B.H. The reason I asked is my girl friend lives in Portland and I've got to talk to her before it gets to her...\n\"\"J.R. Okay\n\"\"B.H. What time is it now?\n\"\"J.R. It's one o'clock\n\"\"B.H. What are the rates now?\n\"\"J.R. Don't you worry about the rates.\n\"\"B.H. Well I should probably give her a call...\n\"\"J.R. You're looking real good. You've got some color...\n\"\"B.H. Is there a phone real close by?\n\"\"J.R. I'll get the nurse...\n\"\"B.H.

BYRD advised that MISS JUDY was a student at the college and had left the college earlier in the afternoon, driving a yellow Datsun. At 2135 hours Reporting Officers put out an All Points Bulletin around the City and County of Napa for this above described vehicle. At 2137 hours Officers received permission to interview the victim BRYAN HARTNELL who was taken to the X-Ray Room for x-rays. Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Lonergan attempted to interview BRYAN HARTNELL while in the presence of DONALD JUDAH and hospital attendant CLIFFORD MEAGHER. Sgt. Narlow was called away to answer a phone before the interview got under way. HARTNELL appeared to be in extreme pain and also appeared to be in shock. Reporting Officer Lonergan introduced himself to HARTNELL and asked him to give us any information he had on his assailant. HARTNELL stated that the assailant was wearing a black ceremonial type hood, square on top, and appeared to be heavy-set, between 200 and 250 pounds. He also stated his assailant had approached both him and MISS SHEPARD with a gun but had stabbed them with a long knife. HARTNELL further stated the gun was in a black holster and the knife was in a sheath. He stated that the attacker was wearing dark clothing, dark jacket and dark pants. HARTNELL further stated that the gun was an automatic pistol and the knife had a black handle and appeared to be homemade.\nIt should be noted that HARTNELL was very groggy and he was very difficult to interview at that time. Subject was re-interviewed the next day by Det/Sgt. Robertson and gave more complete details. (The report of Sgt. Robertson's interview is attached.)\nAt 2215 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan left the Queen of the Valley Hospital after advising Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and William Munk to take charge of the clothing of the victims and any other evidence from the victims when it was released from the hospital. Munk and Brambrink were also advised to stand by at the hospital as a security measure until other arrangements could be made.\nAs Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan were arriving at the Napa County Sheriff's Office, they were advised by the Napa Police Department that they had located MISS JUDY in the downtown Napa area and were bringing her to the Napa County Sheriff's Office. MISS [JUDY] was interviewed by Lonergan and Narlow at the Napa County Sheriff's Office. She was further identified as MISS JUDITH, a student at Pacific Union College, with a permanent residence address of Sun Valley, California. MISS [JUDITH] advised that she was with BRYAN\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

She stated that they all left Pacific Union College together at approximately 1:00 P.M. and went to a rummage sale in the City of St. Helena. She stated that BRYAN had bought a T.V. set at the rummage sale and had to transport it back to his room at Pacific Union College. She stated he left CECELIA at the rummage sale as there was not enough room in his car. MISS [JUDITH] stated BRYAN returned to the St. Helena area and picked up CECELIA at approximately 2:00 P.M. MISS [JUDITH] stated as far as she knew, both BRYAN and CECELIA were planning to go to San Francisco when they left her in St. Helena. MISS [JUDITH] stated she had no knowledge of any plans that BRYAN and CECELIA were making to go to the Lake Berryessa area. MISS [JUDITH] stated the last time she saw BRYAN and CECELIA was approximately 2:00 P.M. in the afternoon.\nThe interview with MISS [JUDITH] was terminated at that point.\nDet/Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow then proceeded to Lake Berryessa and arrived at the scene of the crime, which was approximately a mile and a half north of Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters, at 2354 hours. The scene was being preserved by uniformed officers and under the direct control of Deputy Sheriffs David Collins and Ray Land. The investigating officers were briefed by Officers Collins and Land as to what had taken place prior to our arrival. Officers observed a 1956 white Kharman Ghia with a black vinyl top, Oregon license plate 4 U 2040. Investigating officers were shown footprints in dirt area and tire tracks, both believed to have been left by responsible. Investigating officers awaited the arrival of Sgt. Tom Butler who had been called to take photographs of the crime scene area and Sgt. Hal Snook, criminalist for collection and preservation of physical evidence. R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were advised by Park Ranger Dennis Land who had also arrived at the scene that it was possible to get to the beach area by vehicle from a locked gate approximately one-half mile south of the victim's vehicle. Officers proceeded to the area and arrived at the footpath approximately halfway between the scene of the crime at the beach and the victim's vehicle on the road. At that point, after a brief examination of the footpath area, officers discovered a similar footprint on the footpath to that found at the scene of the victim's vehicle. At that point, due to the lateness and darkness of the hour, Reporting Officers decided to completely secure the area and make a thorough search of the scene at first light. Officers then exited the crime scene area in the same manner and locked the aforementioned gate leading to this vicinity. Investigating officers along with Park Ranger Dennis Land went to the Berryessa Park Headquarters.\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

These items consisted of a blanket, a pair of man's shoes, a wallet belonging to BRYAN HARTNELL, eyeglasses, and playing cards. Among the various aforementioned items believed to belong to the victims, were numerous strands of white plastic line cut into various assorted lengths, some of which had what appeared to be bloodstains. These items were subsequently turned over to Det/Sgt. Hal Snook for preservation.\nAssigned investigators then proceeded back to the scene where the victim's car was parked and assisted Sgt. Snook in the making of the plaster casts. At approximately 0245 hours Sgt. Lonergan, having previously obtained the keys to the vehicle from BRYAN HARTNELL's property at Queen of the Valley Hospital, drove the white Kharman Ghia to the maintenance shop at Berryessa Park Headquarters. The vehicle was parked inside of the maintenance shop building and the building was secured for the evening by investigating officers with the assistance of Park Ranger Dennis Land. Assigned Investigators then returned back to the scene where the victim's vehicle had been previously parked and awaited the arrival of Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and Mel Fechter who were assigned to security duty in the crime scene area. At approximately 0300 hours officers assumed their duties at the crime scene area and the security was placed under the direction of Deputy Allen Brambrink. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then returned to their respective residences with plans to continue the investigation at daybreak.\n9/28/69 0700 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene at Lake Berryessa area, accompanied by Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Capt. Donald Townsend, and Sgt. James Munk. Officers then assisted Det/Sgt. Snook in tracking the footprints from the vehicle to the scene of the crime by the beach area. (The location and preservation of aforementioned footprints will be detailed in a supplementary evidence report by Sgt. Snook.)\nAt 0800 hours Reporting Officers Lonergan and Narlow received information via Park Headquarters that a DR. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his son would like to talk to them at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop regarding a possible suspect in this crime. At 0912 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan contacted DR. R. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his 16-yr. old son DAVID LEE RAYFIELD at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop. DR. RAYFIELD gave a home address of Los Gatos, California. DR. RAYFIELD stated that about 6:30 P.M. the previous evening he and his son had parked their car north of Park Headquarters in the general area of the\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts.

They stated they went down towards the beach area when DAVID RAYFIELD noticed a white male adult subject walking in the area, described as about 5'10\"\", heavy build, wearing dark trousers, a dark shirt with red in it, long sleeves. He stated this subject was carrying nothing in his hands and was apparently just walking alongside the hill area about halfway between the road and the lake. DAVID further stated that when the subject observed him he turned around and walked up the hill in a southerly direction. DR. RAYFIELD and his son stated that they did not notice a vehicle in the area of their vehicle and only this subject at a distance of about 100 yards. They also advised there was a man with two young boys in the area shooting B-B guns, but they did not know if this man saw the subject or not. This location was approximately 8/10ths of a mile from the scene of the victim's vehicle. In the opinion of R/Os, it is unlikely, unless this male subject had a vehicle in the immediate area, he could have traversed the area to the scene of the crime on foot. There are four coves of water between the scene of the crime and the area where the doctor saw the subject. The interview with DR. RAYFIELD and his son was terminated at that point.\nAt 1000 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene of the crime and further assisted Sgt. Snook in the collecting and locating of evidence.\nAt 1320 hours 9/28/69, R/Os interviewed Ranger Sgt. William White at Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters. White was interviewed as to his activities before and during his part in locating the victims the night before. White stated at approximately 1855 hours 9/27/69 he was on routine patrol around the Lake Berryessa area when he received a call from Park Headquarters to proceed to the Rancho Monticello Resort where a person was reporting a possible stabbing. \nWhite stated he proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort where he was contacted by ARCHIE E. WHITE, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG. RONALD FONG advised him that he had seen a male and a female victim on the beach area south of Rancho Monticello Resort, hollering that they had been stabbed. Ranger Sgt. White, accompanied by ARCHIE WHITE, ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the beach area via speedboat owned by ARCHIE WHITE. When they arrived on the beach they observed a young female lying on the ground with what appeared to be numerous stab wounds. Ranger Sgt. White stated that the female appeared to be in a great deal of pain. White stated as they discovered the female victim, Ranger Dennis Land arrived at the scene in his pickup truck, carrying a male victim who also appeared to have numerous stab wounds. White stated he immediately radioed in and had Park Headquarters call the Sheriff's Office to dispatch an ambulance and a Deputy. White stated he attempted to interview both the boy and girl victims while awaiting\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

According to White, the male victim said that a male subject approached them, wearing a hood, dressed in dark clothing. The subject was carrying what appeared to be an automatic pistol and stated that he wanted their money and car keys. According to White, the male victim related to him that the subject advised him he was an ex-con out of Colorado and was en route to Mexico. Suspect stated he had to tie them up, and after they were tied the responsible stated, \"\"I'm going to have to stab you.\"\" White further related that the male victim advised the responsible, \"\"Stab me first, I can't stand to see her stabbed first.\"\" The male victim then advised that the responsible stabbed him numerous times in the back and then stabbed the girl.\nThe female victim advised White that she could not see the responsible's face as a hood was covering all of his head. She also advised White that the suspect had what appeared to be clip-on sunglasses to cover his eyes. Ranger Sgt. White stated that this is the most he could get out of either victim as they were both in great shock and pain. White stated that he noticed a lot of blood near the girl's groin area. The interview with Ranger Sgt. White was terminated at that point.\n9/28/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort and interviewed MR. ARCHIE E. WHITE. (It should be noted that ARCHIE E. WHITE and ELIZABETH WHITE are no relation to Ranger Sgt. White.) ARCHIE E. WHITE is the owner of the Boat Repair Shop at Rancho Monticello Resort. He lives at the Resort. Also interviewed were MR. WHITE's wife, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE. MR. and MRS. WHITE advised that they were contacted by RONALD FONG who advised them he had just observed what appeared to be a male and a female subject lying on the beach south of the Rancho Monticello Resort, covered with blood. FONG advised them that the couple had shouted out to him that they had been stabbed and robbed. MRS. WHITE immediately called Park Headquarters and Ranger Sgt. William White arrived at the Resort a short time later. MR. and MRS. WHITE, accompanied by Ranger Sgt. Bill White and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the scene area in one of MR. WHITE's ski boats. When they arrived on the scene, they observed a young female wearing a sweater dress lying on the beach, covered with blood. When they approached the area she was on her elbows and knees, rocking back and forth as if in great pain. MRS. WHITE stated she immediately attempted to make the victim more comfortable and tried to calm her down until the ambulance arrived. MRS. WHITE stated the girl advised him, \"\"He was a man with a hood... His face was covered... He was wearing black pants... It hurts, it\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts.

WHITE then advised after the female had regained her composure, she told her the man had asked for money but didn't take any. She said she hadn't been raped. MRS. WHITE further advised that the female victim told her that the responsible was wearing glasses, with dark clip-on sunglasses over the hood. She told her that the responsible had a black pistol. MR. ARCHIE WHITE stated he overheard the male victim advise someone that the responsible was wearing gloves. MR. and MRS. WHITE further advised that this is the only information either victim gave them on the responsible, and that they spent the balance of the time attempting to make the victim more comfortable until the arrival of the ambulance.\nAfter the interview with MR. and MRS. WHITE, Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan returned to the Napa County Sheriff's Office.\nAt 1620 hours R/O Det/Sgt. Narlow was contacted by a DEAN of the Pacific Union College in Angwin. DEAN advised that three young ladies, students at the college, might possibly have information as to a suspect in the attack at Lake Berryessa. The young ladies were identified as MISS JOANNE, MISS LINDA, and MISS LINDA. DEAN advised that these girls had been in the Lake Berryessa area from about 3:00 P.M. to 4:30 P.M. the previous Saturday afternoon. They had observed a male subject in a late model, silver blue Chevrolet, two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. DEAN advised that the girls had told him they were observed out of the car by this subject while they were sunbathing on the beach. They described the subject as approximately 40 years old, [blank] feet tall, dressed in dark clothing. Sgt. Narlow dispatched Deputy Sheriff Raymond Land to interview these three girls that evening. (The report of Land's interview is attached.)\nReporting Officers spent the balance of the day and evening going through their investigative notes and issuing a statewide All Points Bulletin.\nMonday, 9/29/69 Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan spent the majority of the morning interviewing numerous citizens and officers from other departments regarding this crime and similar crimes. (A general list of possible suspects was begun and they are noted on separate incident reports as to origin of information and description of suspects, attached.)\nReporting Officers were advised by Deputy Sheriff Ray Land who interviewed the three college girls, MISS [JOANNE], MISS [LINDA], and MISS [LINDA] that the information appeared to have some merit and advised that the three young ladies would be in the office in the afternoon for further interview.\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgt.

Lonergan, Sgt. Snook, and Capt. Donald Townsend.\nLonergan interviewed a MISS JOANNE MARIE, who, [age] years of age, DOB [blank], her address at the college is 114 Dauphine, Pacific Union College, home address South East 12th, College Place, Washington. MISS [JOANNE] advised R/O that on 9/27/69 at approximately 5:30 P.M. she and her two girlfriends parked their vehicle at a location two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. When they left their car they noticed a subject driving a late model silver blue Chevrolet, 2-door sedan, pull up behind them. What appeared to be a white male adult was sitting in the vehicle. They did not observe this subject leave the vehicle. The girls proceeded to the beach area and were sunbathing in their bikinis. After approximately one-half hour had passed, they observed what appeared to be the same subject standing within 40 or 50 feet of them, apparently observing them. This subject was described as 6' tall, weighing 200/210 lbs., muscular build, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing dark pants and a dark pullover shirt. The subject would stare at the three girls but when they looked up at him he would look away. The subject hung around the area for approximately 45 minutes and then the girls observed him walk up the hill. MISS [JOANNE] stated it was very doubtful that from his vantage point in the vehicle the subject could observe the three girls on the beach. She believes he waited in his vehicle and then followed them down after they were on the beach. MISS [JOANNE] further described the car as appearing very conservative. She stated the car did not appear to belong to any young person such as a teenager. She did state the car had California license plates but did not notice the number.\nThe other two young ladies, MISS [LINDA] and MISS [LINDA] were interviewed by Sgt. Snook and Capt. Donald Townsend.\nMISS LINDA who was interviewed by R/O Det/Sgt. Snook, is a WFA, DOB [blank], home address Sunnyside Road, Sanitarium. She stated she left the Angwin area with two other girls, JOANNE and LINDA at approximately 2:45 P.M. 9/27/69. The girls drove through Pope Valley to Lake Berryessa where they parked their vehicle two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand. MISS [LINDA] stated she observed a subject go into the parking lot area to the south. Subject went past their vehicle and backed up so their rear bumpers were nearly touching. Vehicle described as a 1966 or 1967 light blue Chevrolet with California plates. Witness believes the vehicle was a 2-door sedan and described the headlights as being long rather than round. The rear window glass was tinted quite dark. Another vehicle from Angwin with Arizona plates was in the parking area and witness saw the occupants, a MISS DENISE BROWN and a MR. WAYNE HAIGHT. The three girls went\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

After about 30 minutes the subject came down by the beach and passed within 20 feet of witness as he walked from south to north. Subject was described by MISS [LINDA] as approximately 28 years of age, 6' to 6'2\"\" tall, 200/225 lbs., black hair possibly styled, with a part on left, rounded eyes, thin lips, medium nose, straight eyebrows, small ears, well built, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing a black short-sleeved sweater shirt, bunched up in front, and a white tee shirt hanging out in back, and dark trousers. The three girls left the area about 4:30 P.M. and the subject's vehicle was gone. Witnesses did not observe the subject either leave or get back into his vehicle.\nMISS LINDA LEE was interviewed by R/O Capt. Donald Townsend. MISS [LINDA LEE] is a WFA, DOB [blank], address Howell Mountain Road, Angwin. MISS [LINDA LEE] is employed as a secretary of the college press. MISS [LINDA LEE] observed the same vehicle which was described as a late model Chevrolet, sky blue in color. The rear tail lights appeared to be long rather than round. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated they parked their vehicle at approximately 2:55 P.M. and observed the subject in his vehicle at that location. The girls proceeded to the beach and she, MISS [LINDA LEE], again noticed the subject about 30 to 45 minutes after they were at the beach. She noticed him standing on the bank approximately 45 yards from her location. She described the subject as 6 feet tall, stocky build, about 200 lbs., black short-sleeved sweater shirt, dark blue slacks, and straight dark hair neatly combed. She guessed his age at approximately 30 years. Subject had medium color skin and was not wearing glasses. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated she thought she saw a white belt around his back but it possibly was a tee shirt hanging out. She further stated that the man was fairly nice-looking, with a round face. She did not observe the subject leave the area in his vehicle.\n9/29/69 - 1600 hours Reporting Officers Sgt. Narlow and Sgt. Lonergan were advised by Capt. Joseph Page that the female victim, MISS CECELIA SHEPARD, had just died at Queen of the Valley Hospital. Capt. Page, who is Chief Napa County Coroner, stated he would handle the case and contact DR. DE PETRIS who would perform the autopsy the next morning. Capt. Page further advised R/Os that the remains would be removed to Morrison Funeral Home where DR. DE PETRIS would complete the autopsy.\nAt 1945 hours 9/29/69, R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were contacted by Probation Officer H. B. Schotte. Mr. Schotte had observed the footprint design that R/Os had taken at the scene and stated he had knowledge of a possible similar shoe sole design. Mr. Schotte brought into the office a MR. BASSEL, address Sheveland, Apartment #7, Napa, California. MR. [BASSEL] is employed at Travis\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

He is a retired Master Sergeant in the United States Air Force. MR. [BASSEL] showed R/O a pair of Air Force chukker boots that belonged to him. He described these boots as being Government issue, issued to all Air Force personnel at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. They are primarily designed as a wing-walker shoe, however according to MR. [BASSEL] most Air Force personnel and many of the civilian personnel employed at Air Force bases had this type of shoe. The sole design of this shoe exactly matched the plaster cast design that Sgt. Snook had taken at the scene of the crime. It should be noted that Det/Sgt John Robertson had attempted to find a similar shoe design at the local shoe stores in the Napa area with negative results. (Refer Sgt. Robertson's supplementary report.) MR. [BASSEL] was asked if we could keep his shoes for identification purposes and he agreed. R/Os was also advised that this information regarding the type of footprint had not been released to the press or general public. MR. [BASSEL] stated he would cooperate with R/Os and keep this information confidential.\n9/30/69, 0810 hours R/O Sgt. Lonergan received a telephone call from MISS MARILYN DENISE, 18 years of age, DOB [blank]. MISS [MARILYN] is a student at Pacific Union College and resides at Andre Hall, Room B-3.

She stated shortly after they parked the vehicle they observed the victims who were known to them, BRYAN HARTNELL and CECELIA SHEPARD, driving south on Knoxville Road in BRYAN's white Kharman Ghia. She stated as the HARTNELL vehicle drove by, BRYAN waved out the window and said, \"\"Hi, John!\"\", referring to MR. [JOHN]. MISS [MARILYN] stated that they did not see the HARTNELL vehicle any other time that day.\n9/30/69, 0900 hours R/Os Det/Sgt. Narlow and Det/Sgt. Richard Lonergan, accompanied by Sgt. Thomas Butler, proceeded to the Morrison Funeral Home in St. Helena. They were met at the funeral home by Capt. Joseph Page and the owner of the Funeral Home, Mr. Harold. Shortly after the R/Os arrived, they were met by the pathology surgeons, DR. WILMER A. DE PETRIS and DR. DWIGHT G. STRAUB. DR. DE PETRIS offices are at 373 Perkins Street, Sonoma. Above mentioned officers witnessed the autopsy of the female victim, MISS CECELIA SHEPARD, performed by DRS. DE PETRIS and STRAUB. Sgt. Tom Butler took photographs of the deceased both before and during the autopsy. R/O Sgt. Lonergan took notes of the various wounds suffered by the victim.

Kenneth Narlow contacted CAPT. at Travis Air Force Base and arranged for an interview with COL. and SGT. to take place on Wednesday morning, October 1st, 1969, at 9:00 A.M. R/Os wanted to talk to someone at Travis regarding the shoeprints that were found on the scene. The remainder of the day and evening was spent in answering phone calls from people who had possible knowledge of the crime.\nWednesday, 10/1/69 - 0900 hours Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow went to Travis Air Force Base and were present at an interview in Col. office, who is Commanding Officer in charge of base security. Also present at this meeting besides the aforementioned officers was LT. COL. of the Office of Special Investigation. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan advised the Air Force personnel present of the portion of the evidence we had discovered at the crime scene and asked them for assistance in locating where this type of shoe was sold or issued. LT. COL. advised that his office would assist assigned investigators in attempting to locate the source of the shoe.\nOfficers were directed to the Base Supply with the assistance of Special Agent DONALD of O.S.I., at which time it was determined through Base Supply that this shoe in question was of Government issue and that it was not kept in stock at Base Supply, however it was believed that the Sales Store had such an item. It was then explained that if a military person or civilian employee was determined to be in need of such an item, he first reported to the Base Supply, at which time he was issued a purchase requisition which he in turn took to the Sales Store and the type of shoe was issued to the individual and they in turn required the individual to sign the purchase requisition showing that he did receive the item. This purchase requisition states the type of shoe that the individual was to receive, however makes no reference as to size.\nAssigned investigators, accompanied by Special Agent proceeded to the Sales Store located on Travis Air Force Base. After a short period of time R/Os located in stock a shoe fitting the identical description of the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast which officers had in their possession. The identical shoe with identical tread was found and a shoe bearing the closest measurements in the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast was measured and found to be a size 10 1/2 in military styling or a 10 1/2 D in civilian equivalent. It was determined through Air Force records that they were unable to furnish officers with the\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

Air Force records indicate this type shoe is manufactured by the International Shoe Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, then shipped to Air Force Depot, Ogden, Utah, and from there shipped to the various military installations upon requisition orders.\n10/1/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then proceeded to the Vallejo Police Department and met with Sgt. Jack Mullanax and Sgt. Duane Nilsson. Officers exchanged information regarding Vallejo's crime of 7/4/69 and our particular incident. Suspect information was exchanged and is listed in the separate suspect file.\nInvestigating Officers checked to determine the validity of the decoded message and as to how far the original cyphers had been decoded. It was then learned that the message had been decoded by at least two different sources, one being by MR. and MRS. HARDIN of Salinas and the other by the FBI in Washington. It was noted that these cyphers were broken independent of one another and the FBI confirmed the validity of the original decoded message. It was also learned that there was a small portion on the very end of the coded message that had not been decoded for reasons unknown.\nThe balance of the afternoon and evening Reporting Officers and other investigating officers met to exchange information and further discuss the evidence at hand.\nThursday, October 2nd, 1969, 0845 hours Reporting Officer Lonergan received a telephone call from Special Agent, OSI, Travis Air Force Base. Subject called to report that approximately 500 to 1,000 of that type of wing-walker shoe have been sold as surplus on the Base. This would be over and above those sold at the Sales Store. Agent further related he has the names of all the subjects who have purchased this item through surplus and will keep these names available to officers upon request.\nThe balance of the morning was spent searching fingerprint evidence and answering phone calls from possible witnesses.\nThursday, 10/2/69, 1400 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan attended the funeral services for victim CECELIA SHEPARD. These services were held at the Pacific Union College Church, Angwin, California. Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan positioned themselves\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow\n- TYPED BY: M.

Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Sgt. Thomas Butler, and Detective Ronald Montgomery of the Napa Police Department positioned themselves outside the church and photographed all persons entering and leaving the services. This included individual photographs and group scenes. Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow also attended the graveside services at the St. Helena Cemetery in St. Helena.\nFriday, 10/3/69 - Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Richard Lonergan contacted JAMES, Napa State Hospital, advised him to set up an interview with a patient who is a possible suspect in our case. The patient is identified as GRIFFIN RAYMOND FRANKLIN, WMA, 20 yrs. of age, DOB [blank], 6'2\"\", 223 lbs. [JAMES] had previously reported that this subject had left the hospital on a pass Friday evening, 9/26/69, and returned to the hospital Monday afternoon, 9/29/69. This subject also had spent time in the Air Force and was discharged from the Air Force in January 1969 for psychiatric problems. According to the doctors at the hospital, this subject was capable of committing this type of a crime. R/O in the presence of JAMES and Security Officer PHIL RYAN interviewed subject FRANKLIN. FRANKLIN was very cooperative and talkative to R/O and went over his activities the prior weekend. Briefly stated, MR. FRANKLIN, whose parents live in Vallejo, never left the Vallejo area that weekend and stayed around home talking with his mother, stepfather, and three brothers. After interviewing subject, it was the opinion of R/O Sgt. Lonergan that this subject was not the responsible. He had a definite very fast manner of speaking which was completely opposed to the victim's statement concerning the suspect's voice. R/O also contacted the mother of the suspect, a MRS. OPAL at Hollywood Avenue, Vallejo. MRS. OPAL stated more or less the exact same thing that her son had stated as to his whereabouts that weekend. It appears that this subject has a reliable alibi as to his activities and had no access to a vehicle that weekend. This subject was cleared as far as this crime is concerned.\nThe balance of the morning and afternoon was spent by R/Os Det/Sgts.

Reporting Officer John Robertson, Det/Sgt., interviewed one of two victims who were each stabbed numerous times by an unknown assailant. Victim CECELIA SHEPARD and victim BRYAN HARTNELL both had been placed in the Queen of the Valley Hospital intensive care unit. Victim SHEPARD had surgery performed on her earlier in the morning (9/28/69) and was unable to be questioned by the Reporting Officer, however Dr. Ludwig gave permission for victim HARTNELL to be interviewed.\nAlthough victim HARTNELL was heavily sedated, he was able to give R/O a verbal statement. (Note: R/O taped electrically the interview with victim HARTNELL.) Victim HARTNELL related the following.\nHe had known CECELIA SHEPARD for some time, they were good friends, and she had come to the Napa County area to spend the weekend. She and a female companion, DALORA LEE, Aspen, Loma Linda, San Bernardino County, Calif. (phone Ext. 2155) had driven from Southern California and were to drive back Sunday, 9/28/69. Victim stated he and MISS SHEPARD drove to Lake Berryessa, picked a large tree near the shore line where they decided to lie down and enjoy the scenery. While lying on the ground, victim HARTNELL stated he heard a noise and asked MISS SHEPARD if she could hear anything or see anything behind a tree not far from where the couple were lying. MISS SHEPARD told victim HARTNELL she could see a man behind the tree. HARTNELL asked her what he was doing. MISS SHEPARD stated she couldn't tell. HARTNELL stated he (suspect) then came from behind the tree. MISS SHEPARD said, \"\"Oh my God, he has a gun!\"\"\nVictim HARTNELL stated the man approached the couple, aiming a black steel automatic pistol. The suspect stated he needed a car and money. Suspect stated his car was \"\"hot\"\" and he wanted victim HARTNELL's car keys. Victim HARTNELL stated he began talking with the suspect, telling the suspect he had no money, only a small amount of change, also that if the suspect was really in need of assistance HARTNELL would attempt to help him. The suspect told victim to get on the ground. Suspect then had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him. HARTNELL stated he attempted to keep the suspect engaged in conversation while suspect was tying the victims.\nHARTNELL further stated the suspect was described as follows: Wearing a black hooded mask (cloth), covering suspect's entire head and shoulders, coming down almost to suspect's waist. Victim stated on front of the four-cornered type mask (similar to paper bag in style) there was a symbol, the symbol described as white, approximately 3 x 3 inches in diameter, with a symmetrical cross. Also on the eyelets of the mask was a pair of clip-on sunglasses, the glasses clipped to the eyelets. Victim stated he could also see hair through the mask's eyelets and observed the hair to be dark brown.\nVictim stated suspect was wearing a light-weight windbreaker, dark blue or black, pleated slacks (old-fashioned type). Victim could not remember what type of shoes or anything about suspect's hands, could not remember if suspect was wearing gloves.\nVictim thought suspect was possibly 20 to 30 years of age by voice concept. Victim stated suspect was 5'8\"\" to 6', 225-250 lbs., dark brown hair, eyes unknown, sloppy dresser, stomach hanging over trousers. Suspect spoke with some\nPage 17\n(2)\ntype of drawl, but victim stated it was not a Southern drawl, did not really know what type of drawl, but thought the man was not well educated, but did not feel he was illiterate either. Victim said suspect's voice was moderate in sound, that is, not high or low pitched.\nSuspect told victim he was sent to (?) Lodge State Prison (possibly Deer Lodge State Prison), Montana, for a killing. While there (in prison) he killed a guard while escaping. Suspect also told victims he was heading for Mexico, told victim he was flat broke.\nVictim observed cut-up rope in suspect's rear pocket (trouser's), also stated he was wearing a knife in a case (on belt) on his right side, near front of trousers. Knife description: Appeared to be a long bread knife, 12\"\" long blade, 3/4\"\" wide, hardwood handle, 2 brass rivets holding handle in place, cotton surgical tape wrapped approximately 1\"\" around handle of knife. Knife case possibly made of wood.\nVictim asked suspect if suspect's gun was loaded. Suspect removed magazine from handle of pistol and showed victim a bullet removed from gun, bullet described as a possible .45 caliber. Victim did not know what caliber the pistol was.\nSuspect had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him, suspect then tied victim SHEPARD's hands, then re-tied HARTNELL's hands, then tied both victims' ankles together, had victims lie on their stomachs. HARTNELL stated suspect said, \"\"I'm getting nervous.\"\" This was when suspect was tying MISS SHEPARD'S hands, in fact HARTNELL stated suspect got real shaky when he was tying MISS SHEPARD's hands.\nVictim HARTNELL then stated that without warning the suspect plunged his knife into the back of HARTNELL. Suspect did this repeatedly, HARTNELL stated he thinks six times. HARTNELL stated he pretended to be dead and the suspect went over to MISS SHEPARD and stabbed MISS SHEPARD repeatedly in the back, and when MISS SHEPARD turned her body over (on back), suspect stabbed her in the lower abdomen. Victim stated suspect stabbed MISS SHEPARD much worse than him. Suspect went into some sort of frenzy when stabbing MISS SHEPARD.\nVictim HARTNELL stated suspect left the area after the stabbing. Victim HARTNELL hailed a boat (off shore) and told the man in the boat the couple needed help badly. Victim stated the boat left the area and he (victim) attempted to get help by crawling and walking to the road. (Victim believed he had walked to the road, however had not gone too far from his wounded companion.)\nVictim stated he thought suspect had been with the couple for approximately fifteen (15) minutes from time of observing suspect until suspect departed. Victim stated suspect did not take his wallet, although when MISS SHEPARD was tying victim HARTNELL's hands, she reached in his pocket and threw his wallet to suspect. Suspect did not take the wallet or victim's car keys.\nVictim stated a man in a pickup truck found him on the road and called an ambulance. Victim stated he estimated one hour in time was involved between the time he and MISS SHEPARD were stabbed until help arrived.\nMISS SHEPARD is listed in critical condition.\n\n-------\n\nTranscript\nPage 1\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-321-F9-5861\nSgt. ROBERTSON stated that Mr. HARTNELL was heavily sedated but was able to give a verbal statement pertaining to the attack at Lake Berrysessa. The interview was taped and reads as follows:\n\"\"INTERVIEW OF JOHN ROBERTSON, DET/SGT., NAPA COUNTY SHERIFF's DEPARTMENT, WITH BRYAN CALVIN HARTNELL (NSO CASE #105907) AT QUEEN OF THE VALLEY HOSPITAL ON SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1969 (TRANSCRIBED FROM TAPE RECORDING BY M. FEURLE):\n\"\"J.R. Can you give me this fellow's description and tell me what happened?\n\"\"B.H. So many people have been asking me... I hope...\n\"\"J.R. Well sometimes when we're repetitious, I know it happens to me, I tell the same thing over and over and over, and sometimes I might vary a little, and if you do...\n\"\"B.H. Shall I just start out and tell you what happened?\n\"\"J.R. I don't want to tire you out.\n\"\"B.H. I just don't want this to happen again to anybody... Of course he might have his reasons, I don't know...\n\"\"J.R. Okay. Go right ahead. Start right from the beginning. What happened?\n\"\"B.H. Okay. This girl came out from school, I used to go with her two years ago, and she's now going to another school, and she came up to visit some friends and we were having dinner at the school cafeteria, and I said, 'Well, are you doing anything special this afternoon?' and she said, 'Why?', and I said, 'I don't know. We could go out and either go for a walk, go to San Francisco, or, you know, just...', 'cause we used to be good friends. We used to have a good friendship. And so it got too late by the time we got around to what we were going to do. We had to stop in St. Helena for a couple items and then we had to cart a couple kids home and stuff, and by the time we finally got around to it, it was getting late, and I thought going to San Francisco 'd rush you, you know, because by the time we got back for worship... And so we went out to Berryessa, and there was this one place I used to go out... we used to all the time, you know... and I couldn't find it. And so I figured Ah, forget it, and this looks like as good a place as any. So I parked the car, there were no other cars there. I had a Kharman Ghia, '56, white, with a black vinyl top, and it's in pretty\nPage 2\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n... \"\"good-looking shape. But we parked there on the road's edge and we talked Oh it must be about a quarter of a mile to down to the place where we went. We had... (unintelligible) peninsula, it's an an island I guess during the wetter season, You can see where it was levee... And so that looked like a lot... there was a big spreading tree up there. There were two of them, really, one was a little bigger than the other. We took the one that was out on the point.\n\"\"It was really beautiful out there. We were sitting on top... I lay down on my back and she lay down on her stomach beside me, you know, kind of resting her head on my shoulder, and we were talking, you know, kind of reminiscing about old times, and stuff. And I heard these rustling leaves, and I said, 'You have your specs on. Why don't you see what the deal is over there?' And she says, 'Oh, it's some man.' And I said, 'Is he alone?' and she said, 'Yeah... (unintelligible)...' and she says, 'Well he just stepped behind the tree.' And I said, 'What's the idea of that? To take a leak?' You know, 'cause that's the only thing I could think of, just step behind a tree. And so I says, 'Well, keep looking and tell me what happens,' and she says, 'Oh my God, he's got a gun!' and squeezed my arm and\n\"\"And so he came out, and of course still actually I wasn't... There's some things you really wouldn't mind having happen, just for the experience of it. You know I thought, Well I only got fifty cents on me. It's worth all of that having it happen. I didn't think about another angle. So I talked to him, you know. I said, 'Well listen, Mac, (you know I'm in the sociologist field, you know, I'm pre-law, with history and psych.) You know I've read about the criminal mind and everything, you know. I thought well maybe the guy really does need help, you know. I says, 'There's no strings attached.' I says, 'I don't have any money right now but if you need help that badly I can help you out in another way maybe.' And he says, 'Nah.. time's running short,' he says, ''cause I just got out of... some prison in Montana, I don't know what the name of it is. Feathers? Do you know what the name of it is? I'll see if it sounds familiar. Fern or Feathers? It's some double name, like Fern Lock or something...\n\"\"J.R. It's Lodge..\nPage 3\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. Oh yeah, yeah, Lodge. At least we know we're together on that.\n\"\"J.R. Mountain Lodge Prison, or something of that nature...\n\"\"B.H. Yeah. You know he said he broke out and had to kill a guard getting out. And I said, 'Well, man, I mean actually I don't mean to call your bluff or anything, but wouldn't you rather be stuck on a stealing charge than a threat of homicide?' you know? And he says, 'Well just don't start playing hero on me.' You know, 'Don't try to grab the gun,' 'cause I didn't really figure the gun was loaded. I always thought it would be empty. I've heard a lot of times that this is what they do just as a bluff, but I decided not to call his bluff after he really, you know... I told him, 'You know you're really wasting your time with me. I've got a billfold and this much change and that's it.' And he said, he told the girl, 'Go tie him up. I'd feel much better if you were tied up.' And she tied a couple of loose knots on me, so I made it look kind of tight... (unintelligible)... you know, just for a second, and he said 'Go ahead.' And I whispered to her, 'You know I think I can get that gun.' And I said, 'Do you mind?' and she got kind of fearful about it, so I figured since there's two lives involved, not just mine, I won't do it.\n\"\"So I let her tie me up on the wrists again, and he tied her up, - terribly tight, you know, real... (unintelligible) ... put his gun away, and we were talking and all, bantering, you know, basically. I was thinking, anything I can do to help, by the way just to keep the conversation going... Suddenly he was taking it all seriously, you know... So I was starting out and finally he said, 'Okay, lay down. I've got her tied up', you know... He strung a rope between our ankles in the rear, so we were like this, you know, on our stomachs, tied...\n\"\"J.R. You both facing the ground...\n\"\"B.H. Right. And, oh, this was before. I got sort of ahead. So anyway, he said, 'Get down,' and I said, 'Oh come on! We could freeze to death!' I said that a couple, three times, and he said, 'GET DOWN! RIGHT NOW!' He got a little pushed off at me. So I got down and then he finished tying her up and clonked her down, - and then he goes... Sswhooosh (a sound with his mouth)... (unintelligible)\nPage 4\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"And so I said, 'Do you have bullets in there?' And so he pulled out the clip and showed me that he did. The bullets were about this long, I can remember, and about this fat, and they had the regular red cap on it, about this long. Maybe that doesn't give you any better description of the gun or not. I don't know. And it came out of the heel, the grip, you know. It slipped out from the bottom.\n\"\"And now, to backtrack a bit. I was really trying to see what he looked like, you know. He had on pleated pants, these old type of suit pants, you know, and they were either black or dark blue, I can't remember now. And I can't remember what he was wearing for shoes. But he had on this cotton coat, You've seen the kind, that you just turn the collar up once, there's a zipper down the front, you know. They're real light, super-thin, you know...\n\"\"J.R. Kind of a windbreaker...\n\"\"B.H. Yeah, like a windbreaker. And it's got this blue, this little collar, sometimes the guys wear them standing up, you know.\n\"\"J.R. What color was that?\n\"\"B.H. That was dark blue. And I don't know. Maybe he had something in his pouch. I just took it as being a... as being a... you know, he was stout 'cause he looked kind of heavy. I think he was weighing two and a quarter, two fifty, somewhere in there. And I got kind of a look at his hair. His voice... I can remember... almost like I'd heard it before. You know there's some drawls that a lot of people have similar. And... almost as if I'd heard it before... couldn't think where.\n\"\"I gave that one up, I just gave it up on that angle. I looked through his hair. I kind of looked like it was combed, you know, like this.. it was a brownish, you know, dark brown hair.\n\"\"And this mask he had on. It was ingeniously devised. It was... he had four corners at the top, like the top of a paper sack... black. It came down, came down, with the front panel about to here, and a kind of a thing that came over the shoulders, you know, and then the same thing down the back, straight down. And in the front he had a circle with a symmetrical cross in the middle. You know what I mean by a symmetrical cross?\nPage 5\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. Um hum (affirmative).\n\"\"B.H. The ends of the cross hung out about this far on each of the... you know, where it came out. The circle was this much... like this... and then it was like this, you see... hung out on the end, over the edge of the circle.\n\"\"And he had clip-on sunglasses... it was hard to tell. You know, the sunglasses you clip on when you're wearing glasses, eyeglasses, He had those clipped on. I'm pretty sure... I don't think he had glasses, though. I think he just had these clipped on to his suit... you know, that little mask.\n\"\"And I don't know how tall he was. Maybe 5-8 or maybe 5-10, 6 feet, somewhere in there. I'm a very poor judge of height because of my height. I have no meaning, you know. It's always down, you know. It can never be up...\n\"\"And so I saw him put away his gun, and I was turning to say something to Celia, and all of a sudden I felt my back... just... no, I think I saw him pull it out.. I don't remember... I think I saw him whip out his knife and just start stabbing me in the back... CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP! I was just (makes a gutteral sound)... you know that kind of a sound... and Celia turned to see why I was (repeats gutteral sound), you know, and she just about fainted. She went hysterical... (unintelligible) ... and when he finally stopped... I mean he went over and... The doctor says there's six in the back, six wounds on my back. You ought to confirm that. One I've got went clear through the lung. I've got it draining. I did drain a couple pints of blood out as soon as I got here. I lost an awful lot of blood, I guess.\n\"\"We were down... I mean it was absolutely no question in my mind... when a person gets stabbed as many times as we did... we were going to die. I mean there'd be no reason to question it. But somehow I, you know, started (unintelligible)... I just knew there was too much I had to live for. I mean really it does happen... about getting depressed and everything... when you're young you always think about these things... you know you think about it... and when you've got someone forcing your hand, oh well, there was a lot of things I had to do. And what really kept me going... you know my parents are pretty Christian. I haven't been too much of a Christian myself... but if you believe in the principle you ask God to help you. Another thing, What was my only strength was knowing two things. One, that I did not want to die, and two, that I felt that whatever was\nPage 6\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n\"\"going to be was going to be, but I was going to try my damnedest to stay alive. And so, like I say, - before I left her I kissed her, and I said, 'Well,' I says, 'I'm gonna try to get help.'\n\"\"There was a boat kept circling around out there in the lake and we started yelling at it and finally it came within about 100 yards of the shore and turned off its motor and stayed there watching us for about fifteen minutes, and we were just screaming hysterically, trying to get their attention, you know, to come over here. Oh, I don't know, I guess they were afraid that the guy might be there in the bushes and they were liable to get choked or something. So finally he came up a little closer. I didn't have my glasses on... I was just swaying, you know... and I had gotten one of her hands free before they came, and so I kept trying to get her to untie me, and she couldn't, she was too weak, she said.\n\"\"So finally I just kept hollering and hollering, and she said, 'Turn around and let's see if I can do it again.' She finally got it. My hands and my feet were just pure numbness... they're still numb but I'm sure that will go 'way. But I finally got... (unintelligible)... untie her so she could kind of relax out. 'Cause it was a terrible position, you know, upon our stomachs... (unintelligible)...\n\"\"And so I started to go for help. I finally got myself fairly reconciled. I wasn't too worried about dying, if that was what was going to happen, but I knew I had to keep pushing on. I had to force myself into staying alive because it was... I could just see myself... you know, all sort of waves would come over... I just (coughing sound)... (unintelligible)... 'Well, you're not gonna give up this easy', you know. And, like I say, I just kept believing that God would do everything the best, if the thing was gonna happen, but I couldn't see any reason why my dying would be the best good. So I just played along with that.\n\"\"I just started to walk toward the road... everything blacked out on me... my visual... my mind was never blacked out, but my visual was. So I lay down... My eyes started to come open... I just saw a haze of trees, you know. In a little while I got up and went another twenty feet, and then the same thing happened... (unintelligible)... and sat down. Next thing I went clear... (unintelligible)... the road, and by that time I just fell... I just... I was trying so hard to go far I just went too far. Finally I heard this pickup\nPage 7\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"coming... I was just laying alongside the road, and that's where this guy picked me up.\n\"\"They weren't in any hurry at all, it didn't seem like, you know, but they finally called an ambulance. About fifteen minutes later it came... (unintelligible)... but I still believe... I've got feeling... starting to get a little pain to come through. But from the minute that knife blade went in, it was nothing but pure shock from there on. I just did not expect it. I didn't expect that he would do that. That was a variable I had completely left out. And I guess he just took off running after we started running. I don't know. I never saw him before and hope not to see him again... at least outside of a courtroom.\n\"\"It's hard for me to explain much more. I mean I'm trying to give you a kind of example of his technique. He had some rope cut up in his back pocket. And he had a ... well, I thought it was a police automatic because it was in one of these black leather cases, you know...\n\"\"J.R. Was it in a smooth case, or did it have a basket weave like..\n\"\"B.H. Can I have my glasses? Oh, they're not here. It was a smooth one, though.\n\"\"J.R. Did he have this hood down to about the middle of his chest?\n\"\"B.H. No, about like... well, I'll show you... Here... his stomach.. You know I could see his... (voice fades away)\n\"\"J.R. Okay. You said his hair looked dark brown. How could you see his hair?\n\"\"B.H. 'Cause I saw it from where those goggles fit. I looked so closely to find out. And when he turned you know they kind of flittered... I could see his hair. It looked kind of greasy.\n\"\"J.R. Now was he as heavy as I am?\n\"\"B.H. Well I can't say 'cause he wasn't wearing those type of clothes. They were sloppy clothes, you know. And he just had on this old pair of pleated pants. I don't know... How tall are you?\n\"\"J.R. I'm about five eleven.\nPage 8\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. Well, like I say, he was dressed kind of sloppily, you know. His pants real tight up here and his stomach kind of pouched a bit, you know. I don't know... it's hard to say 'cause I can't judge you with being in a suit and all, you know, and him not being professional-looking at all. He could be about the same. It's hard to say. He was so sloppily dressed.\n\"\"J.R. Bryan, you also mentioned a drawl. Well not a drawl, an accent.\n\"\"B.H. It was just something... I guess his way of talking. It was something I couldn't repeat. It's like a song. Sometimes you know what you're going to say but you just can't sing the melody worth a darn.\n\"\"J.R. Did he have a throaty voice or a high pitched?\n\"\"B.H. In between. But it was just a unique way of talking.\n\"\"J.R. Did he sound like an educated man?\n\"\"B.H. Heck no! I don't think so.\n\"\"J.R. Did he sound illiterate?\n\"\"B.H. No. He didn't sound that way either. He just impressed me as being rather low class. The reason was because of his clothes, you know.\n\"\"J.R. Did you lose consciousness when he stabbed you at any time? Did you observe him stab Cecelia?\n\"\"B.H. Yeah...\n\"\"J.R. What did he say after...\n\"\"B.H. He stabbed her a bunch of times in the back. After she turned around, he got her once in the groin and one in the arm I think. He kind of went a little more hog-wild with her than with me. I faked dead... like that... I didn't want him to come back and give me some more.\n\"\"J.R. So you were pretty sure he thought you were dead when he finished working on you?\nPage 9\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. I think he kind of thought that. Of course I don't know because we started talking right after he left. It's hard to say... (unintelligible)... I don't think she fainted either.\n\"\"J.R. Was she in a lot of pain, did she tell you?\n\"\"B.H. Oh yeah. She was more weak at the time... (unintelligible).. from the religious angle. I told her I sure as heck wasn't going to have any deathbed conversion. 'No,' she says... (unintelligible)... I mean it was just like you were gonna die and had a few things to say. But I felt more and more I wasn't losing strength as much... (unintelligible)... that I thought I could cope with...\n\"\"J.R. What you did was a courageous thing. It was a terrible thing to have happen to anyone.\n\"\"B.H. Well there was nothing we could do. We were kind of at the mercy of him. I mean I wanted to get that gun... (unintelligible)... There was a time I think I could have gotten it...\n\"\"J.R. Did it appear to be a .45 to you? An automatic?\n\"\"B.H. It was about this long... along the stock... and had a wood edge on it, you know.. on either side...\n\"\"J.R. Handles.\n\"\"B.H. Yeah...yeah...\n\"\"J.R. Did the bullet look anything like that?\n\"\"B.H. No. It was kind of like this, only it was gold, and this part here came out along with this and then round the gold, round the blunt end. Not quite that blunt-ended, though.\n\"\"J.R. Was it fat? Fatter than this?\n\"\"B.H. Yeah, I think it was a little fatter. But it was gold, you know. And I didn't see any of this here. There was a part where it crimped... Well, almost like that 22, short, only a lot bigger. It was about like this length, maybe more stubby.\nPage 10\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n\"\"J.R. Well I'll get a .45 a little later and we can bring it up and let you observe it.\n\"\"B.H. \"\"Let's take the suspect. His hands... I don't remember if they had gloves on or not. I can't remember now. I keep thinking that he had gloves on. I can't figure how he tied us... Let's ask Celia, she probably knows about that.\n\"\"J.R. Did he swear? Did he use any profane language or obscenity?\n\"\"B.H. I don't think so. If he did it was no more than I was using at the time. I don't think he used any obscenity. He might have used a swear word or something, you know. That wasn't striking to me...\n\"\"J.R. Do you have any idea what his motive might have been? Money?\n\"\"B.H. Money. He said he was going to go to Mexico and he was flat broke.\n\"\"J.R. Did he search you after he...\n\"\"B.H. Heck no! Very unprofessional. He didn't even end up taking that loose change and didn't even take my billfold.\n\"\"J.R. Why did he stab you when you weren't fighting him off or anything?\n\"\"B.H. I couldn't. Even if I'd have wanted to. I was laying on my stomach...\n\"\"J.R. So what would have been the purpose of him to stab you, do you think?\n\"\"B.H. Well I (unintelligible)...but I think he got rattled... (unintelligible)... very, very nervous. His hands were shaking... (unintelligible)... Are you nervous?\n\"\"J.R. I'm just curious. If you could write me that symbol you were telling me about. Do you think you could draw me a picture of that even without your glasses?\n\"\"B.H. Um hum (affirmative). (Draws)... kind of like that. I can't see very well...\nPage 11\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. Yes, I see. Okay...\n\"\"B.H. ... (unintelligible)... that I could really die...\n\"\"J.R. Does this ring a bell?\n\"\"B.H. This one here. This is more like it, but I'm not sure. It was distinctly that design. It was thick. More thick marks.\n\"\"J.R. Okay. What color was this? Do you recall?\n\"\"B.H. Black. And that was white.\n\"\"J.R. This was black.\n\"\"B.H. No, that was white. It was about this tall.\n\"\"J.R. Two and a half, three inches?\n\"\"B.H. About four by four... three by three...\n\"\"J.R. How do you feel? Am I tiring you out too much?\n\"\"B.H. No. I've had a couple shots. It's not hurting me at all.\n\"\"J.R. Do you think Cecelia could tell me any more than you have already told me? Add anything?\n\"\"B.H. (unintelligible)\n\"\"J.R. Did he slap you around? Slap her?\n\"\"B.H. (unintelligible)... No.\n\"\"J.R. He was a much smaller man than you?\n\"\"B.H. Not much. About your height I guess. I don't know.\n\"\"J.R. Well you're getting kind of sleepy. I'll ease up on you.\n\"\"B.H. Have you gotten any clues at all?\n\"\"J.R. Yes, we've got some good clues. Before we get this guy it's going to take a lot of work.\n\"\"B.H. Remember he said he was headed for Mexico,\nPage 12\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. He's headed for Mexico?\n\"\"B.H. That's what he said.\n\"\"J.R. I'll leave you my card. It's right up here. I'm going to go down and talk to your mom and dad.\n\"\"B.H. Have the news heard about this at all?\n\"\"J.R. Yes.\n\"\"B.H. Was there anything in the paper today?\n\"\"J.R. No, it wasn't in...\n\"\"B.H. The Napa paper?\n\"\"J.R. Well there's no Napa paper on Sundays. It's been on the news media...\n\"\"B.H. Names? Did they name my name?\n\"\"J.R. I don't know, to tell you the truth.\n\"\"B.H. The reason I asked is my girl friend lives in Portland and I've got to talk to her before it gets to her...\n\"\"J.R. Okay\n\"\"B.H. What time is it now?\n\"\"J.R. It's one o'clock\n\"\"B.H. What are the rates now?\n\"\"J.R. Don't you worry about the rates.\n\"\"B.H. Well I should probably give her a call...\n\"\"J.R. You're looking real good. You've got some color...\n\"\"B.H. Is there a phone real close by?\n\"\"J.R. I'll get the nurse...\n\"\"B.H. 'Cause I'd like to call her now...\nPage 13\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R.

BYRD advised that MISS JUDY was a student at the college and had left the college earlier in the afternoon, driving a yellow Datsun. At 2135 hours Reporting Officers put out an All Points Bulletin around the City and County of Napa for this above described vehicle. At 2137 hours Officers received permission to interview the victim BRYAN HARTNELL who was taken to the X-Ray Room for x-rays. Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Lonergan attempted to interview BRYAN HARTNELL while in the presence of DONALD JUDAH and hospital attendant CLIFFORD MEAGHER. Sgt. Narlow was called away to answer a phone before the interview got under way. HARTNELL appeared to be in extreme pain and also appeared to be in shock. Reporting Officer Lonergan introduced himself to HARTNELL and asked him to give us any information he had on his assailant. HARTNELL stated that the assailant was wearing a black ceremonial type hood, square on top, and appeared to be heavy-set, between 200 and 250 pounds. He also stated his assailant had approached both him and MISS SHEPARD with a gun but had stabbed them with a long knife. HARTNELL further stated the gun was in a black holster and the knife was in a sheath. He stated that the attacker was wearing dark clothing, dark jacket and dark pants. HARTNELL further stated that the gun was an automatic pistol and the knife had a black handle and appeared to be homemade.\nIt should be noted that HARTNELL was very groggy and he was very difficult to interview at that time. Subject was re-interviewed the next day by Det/Sgt. Robertson and gave more complete details. (The report of Sgt. Robertson's interview is attached.)\nAt 2215 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan left the Queen of the Valley Hospital after advising Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and William Munk to take charge of the clothing of the victims and any other evidence from the victims when it was released from the hospital. Munk and Brambrink were also advised to stand by at the hospital as a security measure until other arrangements could be made.\nAs Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan were arriving at the Napa County Sheriff's Office, they were advised by the Napa Police Department that they had located MISS JUDY in the downtown Napa area and were bringing her to the Napa County Sheriff's Office. MISS [JUDY] was interviewed by Lonergan and Narlow at the Napa County Sheriff's Office. She was further identified as MISS JUDITH, a student at Pacific Union College, with a permanent residence address of Sun Valley, California. MISS [JUDITH] advised that she was with BRYAN\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

She stated that they all left Pacific Union College together at approximately 1:00 P.M. and went to a rummage sale in the City of St. Helena. She stated that BRYAN had bought a T.V. set at the rummage sale and had to transport it back to his room at Pacific Union College. She stated he left CECELIA at the rummage sale as there was not enough room in his car. MISS [JUDITH] stated BRYAN returned to the St. Helena area and picked up CECELIA at approximately 2:00 P.M. MISS [JUDITH] stated as far as she knew, both BRYAN and CECELIA were planning to go to San Francisco when they left her in St. Helena. MISS [JUDITH] stated she had no knowledge of any plans that BRYAN and CECELIA were making to go to the Lake Berryessa area. MISS [JUDITH] stated the last time she saw BRYAN and CECELIA was approximately 2:00 P.M. in the afternoon.\nThe interview with MISS [JUDITH] was terminated at that point.\nDet/Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow then proceeded to Lake Berryessa and arrived at the scene of the crime, which was approximately a mile and a half north of Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters, at 2354 hours. The scene was being preserved by uniformed officers and under the direct control of Deputy Sheriffs David Collins and Ray Land. The investigating officers were briefed by Officers Collins and Land as to what had taken place prior to our arrival. Officers observed a 1956 white Kharman Ghia with a black vinyl top, Oregon license plate 4 U 2040. Investigating officers were shown footprints in dirt area and tire tracks, both believed to have been left by responsible. Investigating officers awaited the arrival of Sgt. Tom Butler who had been called to take photographs of the crime scene area and Sgt. Hal Snook, criminalist for collection and preservation of physical evidence. R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were advised by Park Ranger Dennis Land who had also arrived at the scene that it was possible to get to the beach area by vehicle from a locked gate approximately one-half mile south of the victim's vehicle. Officers proceeded to the area and arrived at the footpath approximately halfway between the scene of the crime at the beach and the victim's vehicle on the road. At that point, after a brief examination of the footpath area, officers discovered a similar footprint on the footpath to that found at the scene of the victim's vehicle. At that point, due to the lateness and darkness of the hour, Reporting Officers decided to completely secure the area and make a thorough search of the scene at first light. Officers then exited the crime scene area in the same manner and locked the aforementioned gate leading to this vicinity. Investigating officers along with Park Ranger Dennis Land went to the Berryessa Park Headquarters.\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

These items consisted of a blanket, a pair of man's shoes, a wallet belonging to BRYAN HARTNELL, eyeglasses, and playing cards. Among the various aforementioned items believed to belong to the victims, were numerous strands of white plastic line cut into various assorted lengths, some of which had what appeared to be bloodstains. These items were subsequently turned over to Det/Sgt. Hal Snook for preservation.\nAssigned investigators then proceeded back to the scene where the victim's car was parked and assisted Sgt. Snook in the making of the plaster casts. At approximately 0245 hours Sgt. Lonergan, having previously obtained the keys to the vehicle from BRYAN HARTNELL's property at Queen of the Valley Hospital, drove the white Kharman Ghia to the maintenance shop at Berryessa Park Headquarters. The vehicle was parked inside of the maintenance shop building and the building was secured for the evening by investigating officers with the assistance of Park Ranger Dennis Land. Assigned Investigators then returned back to the scene where the victim's vehicle had been previously parked and awaited the arrival of Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and Mel Fechter who were assigned to security duty in the crime scene area. At approximately 0300 hours officers assumed their duties at the crime scene area and the security was placed under the direction of Deputy Allen Brambrink. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then returned to their respective residences with plans to continue the investigation at daybreak.\n9/28/69 0700 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene at Lake Berryessa area, accompanied by Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Capt. Donald Townsend, and Sgt. James Munk. Officers then assisted Det/Sgt. Snook in tracking the footprints from the vehicle to the scene of the crime by the beach area. (The location and preservation of aforementioned footprints will be detailed in a supplementary evidence report by Sgt. Snook.)\nAt 0800 hours Reporting Officers Lonergan and Narlow received information via Park Headquarters that a DR. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his son would like to talk to them at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop regarding a possible suspect in this crime. At 0912 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan contacted DR. R. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his 16-yr. old son DAVID LEE RAYFIELD at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop. DR. RAYFIELD gave a home address of Los Gatos, California. DR. RAYFIELD stated that about 6:30 P.M. the previous evening he and his son had parked their car north of Park Headquarters in the general area of the\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts.

They stated they went down towards the beach area when DAVID RAYFIELD noticed a white male adult subject walking in the area, described as about 5'10\"\", heavy build, wearing dark trousers, a dark shirt with red in it, long sleeves. He stated this subject was carrying nothing in his hands and was apparently just walking alongside the hill area about halfway between the road and the lake. DAVID further stated that when the subject observed him he turned around and walked up the hill in a southerly direction. DR. RAYFIELD and his son stated that they did not notice a vehicle in the area of their vehicle and only this subject at a distance of about 100 yards. They also advised there was a man with two young boys in the area shooting B-B guns, but they did not know if this man saw the subject or not. This location was approximately 8/10ths of a mile from the scene of the victim's vehicle. In the opinion of R/Os, it is unlikely, unless this male subject had a vehicle in the immediate area, he could have traversed the area to the scene of the crime on foot. There are four coves of water between the scene of the crime and the area where the doctor saw the subject. The interview with DR. RAYFIELD and his son was terminated at that point.\nAt 1000 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene of the crime and further assisted Sgt. Snook in the collecting and locating of evidence.\nAt 1320 hours 9/28/69, R/Os interviewed Ranger Sgt. William White at Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters. White was interviewed as to his activities before and during his part in locating the victims the night before. White stated at approximately 1855 hours 9/27/69 he was on routine patrol around the Lake Berryessa area when he received a call from Park Headquarters to proceed to the Rancho Monticello Resort where a person was reporting a possible stabbing. \nWhite stated he proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort where he was contacted by ARCHIE E. WHITE, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG. RONALD FONG advised him that he had seen a male and a female victim on the beach area south of Rancho Monticello Resort, hollering that they had been stabbed. Ranger Sgt. White, accompanied by ARCHIE WHITE, ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the beach area via speedboat owned by ARCHIE WHITE. When they arrived on the beach they observed a young female lying on the ground with what appeared to be numerous stab wounds. Ranger Sgt. White stated that the female appeared to be in a great deal of pain. White stated as they discovered the female victim, Ranger Dennis Land arrived at the scene in his pickup truck, carrying a male victim who also appeared to have numerous stab wounds. White stated he immediately radioed in and had Park Headquarters call the Sheriff's Office to dispatch an ambulance and a Deputy. White stated he attempted to interview both the boy and girl victims while awaiting\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

According to White, the male victim said that a male subject approached them, wearing a hood, dressed in dark clothing. The subject was carrying what appeared to be an automatic pistol and stated that he wanted their money and car keys. According to White, the male victim related to him that the subject advised him he was an ex-con out of Colorado and was en route to Mexico. Suspect stated he had to tie them up, and after they were tied the responsible stated, \"\"I'm going to have to stab you.\"\" White further related that the male victim advised the responsible, \"\"Stab me first, I can't stand to see her stabbed first.\"\" The male victim then advised that the responsible stabbed him numerous times in the back and then stabbed the girl.\nThe female victim advised White that she could not see the responsible's face as a hood was covering all of his head. She also advised White that the suspect had what appeared to be clip-on sunglasses to cover his eyes. Ranger Sgt. White stated that this is the most he could get out of either victim as they were both in great shock and pain. White stated that he noticed a lot of blood near the girl's groin area. The interview with Ranger Sgt. White was terminated at that point.\n9/28/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort and interviewed MR. ARCHIE E. WHITE. (It should be noted that ARCHIE E. WHITE and ELIZABETH WHITE are no relation to Ranger Sgt. White.) ARCHIE E. WHITE is the owner of the Boat Repair Shop at Rancho Monticello Resort. He lives at the Resort. Also interviewed were MR. WHITE's wife, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE. MR. and MRS. WHITE advised that they were contacted by RONALD FONG who advised them he had just observed what appeared to be a male and a female subject lying on the beach south of the Rancho Monticello Resort, covered with blood. FONG advised them that the couple had shouted out to him that they had been stabbed and robbed. MRS. WHITE immediately called Park Headquarters and Ranger Sgt. William White arrived at the Resort a short time later. MR. and MRS. WHITE, accompanied by Ranger Sgt. Bill White and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the scene area in one of MR. WHITE's ski boats. When they arrived on the scene, they observed a young female wearing a sweater dress lying on the beach, covered with blood. When they approached the area she was on her elbows and knees, rocking back and forth as if in great pain. MRS. WHITE stated she immediately attempted to make the victim more comfortable and tried to calm her down until the ambulance arrived. MRS. WHITE stated the girl advised him, \"\"He was a man with a hood... His face was covered... He was wearing black pants... It hurts, it\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts.

WHITE then advised after the female had regained her composure, she told her the man had asked for money but didn't take any. She said she hadn't been raped. MRS. WHITE further advised that the female victim told her that the responsible was wearing glasses, with dark clip-on sunglasses over the hood. She told her that the responsible had a black pistol. MR. ARCHIE WHITE stated he overheard the male victim advise someone that the responsible was wearing gloves. MR. and MRS. WHITE further advised that this is the only information either victim gave them on the responsible, and that they spent the balance of the time attempting to make the victim more comfortable until the arrival of the ambulance.\nAfter the interview with MR. and MRS. WHITE, Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan returned to the Napa County Sheriff's Office.\nAt 1620 hours R/O Det/Sgt. Narlow was contacted by a DEAN of the Pacific Union College in Angwin. DEAN advised that three young ladies, students at the college, might possibly have information as to a suspect in the attack at Lake Berryessa. The young ladies were identified as MISS JOANNE, MISS LINDA, and MISS LINDA. DEAN advised that these girls had been in the Lake Berryessa area from about 3:00 P.M. to 4:30 P.M. the previous Saturday afternoon. They had observed a male subject in a late model, silver blue Chevrolet, two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. DEAN advised that the girls had told him they were observed out of the car by this subject while they were sunbathing on the beach. They described the subject as approximately 40 years old, [blank] feet tall, dressed in dark clothing. Sgt. Narlow dispatched Deputy Sheriff Raymond Land to interview these three girls that evening. (The report of Land's interview is attached.)\nReporting Officers spent the balance of the day and evening going through their investigative notes and issuing a statewide All Points Bulletin.\nMonday, 9/29/69 Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan spent the majority of the morning interviewing numerous citizens and officers from other departments regarding this crime and similar crimes. (A general list of possible suspects was begun and they are noted on separate incident reports as to origin of information and description of suspects, attached.)\nReporting Officers were advised by Deputy Sheriff Ray Land who interviewed the three college girls, MISS [JOANNE], MISS [LINDA], and MISS [LINDA] that the information appeared to have some merit and advised that the three young ladies would be in the office in the afternoon for further interview.\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgt.

Lonergan, Sgt. Snook, and Capt. Donald Townsend.\nLonergan interviewed a MISS JOANNE MARIE, who, [age] years of age, DOB [blank], her address at the college is 114 Dauphine, Pacific Union College, home address South East 12th, College Place, Washington. MISS [JOANNE] advised R/O that on 9/27/69 at approximately 5:30 P.M. she and her two girlfriends parked their vehicle at a location two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. When they left their car they noticed a subject driving a late model silver blue Chevrolet, 2-door sedan, pull up behind them. What appeared to be a white male adult was sitting in the vehicle. They did not observe this subject leave the vehicle. The girls proceeded to the beach area and were sunbathing in their bikinis. After approximately one-half hour had passed, they observed what appeared to be the same subject standing within 40 or 50 feet of them, apparently observing them. This subject was described as 6' tall, weighing 200/210 lbs., muscular build, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing dark pants and a dark pullover shirt. The subject would stare at the three girls but when they looked up at him he would look away. The subject hung around the area for approximately 45 minutes and then the girls observed him walk up the hill. MISS [JOANNE] stated it was very doubtful that from his vantage point in the vehicle the subject could observe the three girls on the beach. She believes he waited in his vehicle and then followed them down after they were on the beach. MISS [JOANNE] further described the car as appearing very conservative. She stated the car did not appear to belong to any young person such as a teenager. She did state the car had California license plates but did not notice the number.\nThe other two young ladies, MISS [LINDA] and MISS [LINDA] were interviewed by Sgt. Snook and Capt. Donald Townsend.\nMISS LINDA who was interviewed by R/O Det/Sgt. Snook, is a WFA, DOB [blank], home address Sunnyside Road, Sanitarium. She stated she left the Angwin area with two other girls, JOANNE and LINDA at approximately 2:45 P.M. 9/27/69. The girls drove through Pope Valley to Lake Berryessa where they parked their vehicle two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand. MISS [LINDA] stated she observed a subject go into the parking lot area to the south. Subject went past their vehicle and backed up so their rear bumpers were nearly touching. Vehicle described as a 1966 or 1967 light blue Chevrolet with California plates. Witness believes the vehicle was a 2-door sedan and described the headlights as being long rather than round. The rear window glass was tinted quite dark. Another vehicle from Angwin with Arizona plates was in the parking area and witness saw the occupants, a MISS DENISE BROWN and a MR. WAYNE HAIGHT.

After about 30 minutes the subject came down by the beach and passed within 20 feet of witness as he walked from south to north. Subject was described by MISS [LINDA] as approximately 28 years of age, 6' to 6'2\"\" tall, 200/225 lbs., black hair possibly styled, with a part on left, rounded eyes, thin lips, medium nose, straight eyebrows, small ears, well built, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing a black short-sleeved sweater shirt, bunched up in front, and a white tee shirt hanging out in back, and dark trousers. The three girls left the area about 4:30 P.M. and the subject's vehicle was gone. Witnesses did not observe the subject either leave or get back into his vehicle.\nMISS LINDA LEE was interviewed by R/O Capt. Donald Townsend. MISS [LINDA LEE] is a WFA, DOB [blank], address Howell Mountain Road, Angwin. MISS [LINDA LEE] is employed as a secretary of the college press. MISS [LINDA LEE] observed the same vehicle which was described as a late model Chevrolet, sky blue in color. The rear tail lights appeared to be long rather than round. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated they parked their vehicle at approximately 2:55 P.M. and observed the subject in his vehicle at that location. The girls proceeded to the beach and she, MISS [LINDA LEE], again noticed the subject about 30 to 45 minutes after they were at the beach. She noticed him standing on the bank approximately 45 yards from her location. She described the subject as 6 feet tall, stocky build, about 200 lbs., black short-sleeved sweater shirt, dark blue slacks, and straight dark hair neatly combed. She guessed his age at approximately 30 years. Subject had medium color skin and was not wearing glasses. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated she thought she saw a white belt around his back but it possibly was a tee shirt hanging out. She further stated that the man was fairly nice-looking, with a round face. She did not observe the subject leave the area in his vehicle.\n9/29/69 - 1600 hours Reporting Officers Sgt. Narlow and Sgt. Lonergan were advised by Capt. Joseph Page that the female victim, MISS CECELIA SHEPARD, had just died at Queen of the Valley Hospital. Capt. Page, who is Chief Napa County Coroner, stated he would handle the case and contact DR.

DE PETRIS would complete the autopsy.\nAt 1945 hours 9/29/69, R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were contacted by Probation Officer H. B. Schotte. Mr. Schotte had observed the footprint design that R/Os had taken at the scene and stated he had knowledge of a possible similar shoe sole design. Mr. Schotte brought into the office a MR.

He described these boots as being Government issue, issued to all Air Force personnel at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. They are primarily designed as a wing-walker shoe, however according to MR. [BASSEL] most Air Force personnel and many of the civilian personnel employed at Air Force bases had this type of shoe. The sole design of this shoe exactly matched the plaster cast design that Sgt. Snook had taken at the scene of the crime. It should be noted that Det/Sgt John Robertson had attempted to find a similar shoe design at the local shoe stores in the Napa area with negative results. (Refer Sgt. Robertson's supplementary report.) MR. [BASSEL] was asked if we could keep his shoes for identification purposes and he agreed. R/Os was also advised that this information regarding the type of footprint had not been released to the press or general public. MR. [BASSEL] stated he would cooperate with R/Os and keep this information confidential.\n9/30/69, 0810 hours R/O Sgt.

She stated at this time they were parked on the Knoxville Road approximately one mile south of the Lake Berryessa Marina. She stated shortly after they parked the vehicle they observed the victims who were known to them, BRYAN HARTNELL and CECELIA SHEPARD, driving south on Knoxville Road in BRYAN's white Kharman Ghia. She stated as the HARTNELL vehicle drove by, BRYAN waved out the window and said, \"\"Hi, John!\"\", referring to MR. [JOHN]. MISS [MARILYN] stated that they did not see the HARTNELL vehicle any other time that day.\n9/30/69, 0900 hours R/Os Det/Sgt. Narlow and Det/Sgt. Richard Lonergan, accompanied by Sgt. Thomas Butler, proceeded to the Morrison Funeral Home in St. Helena. They were met at the funeral home by Capt. Joseph Page and the owner of the Funeral Home, Mr. Harold.

Kenneth Narlow contacted CAPT. at Travis Air Force Base and arranged for an interview with COL. and SGT. to take place on Wednesday morning, October 1st, 1969, at 9:00 A.M. R/Os wanted to talk to someone at Travis regarding the shoeprints that were found on the scene. The remainder of the day and evening was spent in answering phone calls from people who had possible knowledge of the crime.\nWednesday, 10/1/69 - 0900 hours Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow went to Travis Air Force Base and were present at an interview in Col. office, who is Commanding Officer in charge of base security. Also present at this meeting besides the aforementioned officers was LT. COL. of the Office of Special Investigation. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan advised the Air Force personnel present of the portion of the evidence we had discovered at the crime scene and asked them for assistance in locating where this type of shoe was sold or issued. LT. COL. advised that his office would assist assigned investigators in attempting to locate the source of the shoe.\nOfficers were directed to the Base Supply with the assistance of Special Agent DONALD of O.S.I., at which time it was determined through Base Supply that this shoe in question was of Government issue and that it was not kept in stock at Base Supply, however it was believed that the Sales Store had such an item. It was then explained that if a military person or civilian employee was determined to be in need of such an item, he first reported to the Base Supply, at which time he was issued a purchase requisition which he in turn took to the Sales Store and the type of shoe was issued to the individual and they in turn required the individual to sign the purchase requisition showing that he did receive the item. This purchase requisition states the type of shoe that the individual was to receive, however makes no reference as to size.\nAssigned investigators, accompanied by Special Agent proceeded to the Sales Store located on Travis Air Force Base. After a short period of time R/Os located in stock a shoe fitting the identical description of the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast which officers had in their possession. The identical shoe with identical tread was found and a shoe bearing the closest measurements in the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast was measured and found to be a size 10 1/2 in military styling or a 10 1/2 D in civilian equivalent. It was determined through Air Force records that they were unable to furnish officers with the\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

Air Force records indicate this type shoe is manufactured by the International Shoe Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, then shipped to Air Force Depot, Ogden, Utah, and from there shipped to the various military installations upon requisition orders.\n10/1/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then proceeded to the Vallejo Police Department and met with Sgt. Jack Mullanax and Sgt. Duane Nilsson. Officers exchanged information regarding Vallejo's crime of 7/4/69 and our particular incident. Suspect information was exchanged and is listed in the separate suspect file.\nInvestigating Officers checked to determine the validity of the decoded message and as to how far the original cyphers had been decoded. It was then learned that the message had been decoded by at least two different sources, one being by MR. and MRS. HARDIN of Salinas and the other by the FBI in Washington. It was noted that these cyphers were broken independent of one another and the FBI confirmed the validity of the original decoded message. It was also learned that there was a small portion on the very end of the coded message that had not been decoded for reasons unknown.\nThe balance of the afternoon and evening Reporting Officers and other investigating officers met to exchange information and further discuss the evidence at hand.\nThursday, October 2nd, 1969, 0845 hours Reporting Officer Lonergan received a telephone call from Special Agent, OSI, Travis Air Force Base. Subject called to report that approximately 500 to 1,000 of that type of wing-walker shoe have been sold as surplus on the Base. This would be over and above those sold at the Sales Store. Agent further related he has the names of all the subjects who have purchased this item through surplus and will keep these names available to officers upon request.\nThe balance of the morning was spent searching fingerprint evidence and answering phone calls from possible witnesses.\nThursday, 10/2/69, 1400 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan attended the funeral services for victim CECELIA SHEPARD.

This included individual photographs and group scenes. Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow also attended the graveside services at the St. Helena Cemetery in St. Helena.\nFriday, 10/3/69 - Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Richard Lonergan contacted JAMES, Napa State Hospital, advised him to set up an interview with a patient who is a possible suspect in our case. The patient is identified as GRIFFIN RAYMOND FRANKLIN, WMA, 20 yrs. of age, DOB [blank], 6'2\"\", 223 lbs. [JAMES] had previously reported that this subject had left the hospital on a pass Friday evening, 9/26/69, and returned to the hospital Monday afternoon, 9/29/69. This subject also had spent time in the Air Force and was discharged from the Air Force in January 1969 for psychiatric problems. According to the doctors at the hospital, this subject was capable of committing this type of a crime. R/O in the presence of JAMES and Security Officer PHIL RYAN interviewed subject FRANKLIN. FRANKLIN was very cooperative and talkative to R/O and went over his activities the prior weekend. Briefly stated, MR. FRANKLIN, whose parents live in Vallejo, never left the Vallejo area that weekend and stayed around home talking with his mother, stepfather, and three brothers. After interviewing subject, it was the opinion of R/O Sgt. Lonergan that this subject was not the responsible. He had a definite very fast manner of speaking which was completely opposed to the victim's statement concerning the suspect's voice. R/O also contacted the mother of the suspect, a MRS. OPAL at Hollywood Avenue, Vallejo. MRS. OPAL stated more or less the exact same thing that her son had stated as to his whereabouts that weekend. It appears that this subject has a reliable alibi as to his activities and had no access to a vehicle that weekend.

Reporting Officer John Robertson, Det/Sgt., interviewed one of two victims who were each stabbed numerous times by an unknown assailant. Victim CECELIA SHEPARD and victim BRYAN HARTNELL both had been placed in the Queen of the Valley Hospital intensive care unit. Victim SHEPARD had surgery performed on her earlier in the morning (9/28/69) and was unable to be questioned by the Reporting Officer, however Dr. Ludwig gave permission for victim HARTNELL to be interviewed.\nAlthough victim HARTNELL was heavily sedated, he was able to give R/O a verbal statement. (Note: R/O taped electrically the interview with victim HARTNELL.) Victim HARTNELL related the following.\nHe had known CECELIA SHEPARD for some time, they were good friends, and she had come to the Napa County area to spend the weekend. She and a female companion, DALORA LEE, Aspen, Loma Linda, San Bernardino County, Calif. (phone Ext. 2155) had driven from Southern California and were to drive back Sunday, 9/28/69. Victim stated he and MISS SHEPARD drove to Lake Berryessa, picked a large tree near the shore line where they decided to lie down and enjoy the scenery. While lying on the ground, victim HARTNELL stated he heard a noise and asked MISS SHEPARD if she could hear anything or see anything behind a tree not far from where the couple were lying. MISS SHEPARD told victim HARTNELL she could see a man behind the tree. HARTNELL asked her what he was doing. MISS SHEPARD stated she couldn't tell. HARTNELL stated he (suspect) then came from behind the tree. MISS SHEPARD said, \"\"Oh my God, he has a gun!\"\"\nVictim HARTNELL stated the man approached the couple, aiming a black steel automatic pistol. The suspect stated he needed a car and money. Suspect stated his car was \"\"hot\"\" and he wanted victim HARTNELL's car keys. Victim HARTNELL stated he began talking with the suspect, telling the suspect he had no money, only a small amount of change, also that if the suspect was really in need of assistance HARTNELL would attempt to help him. The suspect told victim to get on the ground. Suspect then had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him. HARTNELL stated he attempted to keep the suspect engaged in conversation while suspect was tying the victims.\nHARTNELL further stated the suspect was described as follows: Wearing a black hooded mask (cloth), covering suspect's entire head and shoulders, coming down almost to suspect's waist. Victim stated on front of the four-cornered type mask (similar to paper bag in style) there was a symbol, the symbol described as white, approximately 3 x 3 inches in diameter, with a symmetrical cross. Also on the eyelets of the mask was a pair of clip-on sunglasses, the glasses clipped to the eyelets. Victim stated he could also see hair through the mask's eyelets and observed the hair to be dark brown.\nVictim stated suspect was wearing a light-weight windbreaker, dark blue or black, pleated slacks (old-fashioned type). Victim could not remember what type of shoes or anything about suspect's hands, could not remember if suspect was wearing gloves.\nVictim thought suspect was possibly 20 to 30 years of age by voice concept. Victim stated suspect was 5'8\"\" to 6', 225-250 lbs., dark brown hair, eyes unknown, sloppy dresser, stomach hanging over trousers. Suspect spoke with some\nPage 17\n(2)\ntype of drawl, but victim stated it was not a Southern drawl, did not really know what type of drawl, but thought the man was not well educated, but did not feel he was illiterate either. Victim said suspect's voice was moderate in sound, that is, not high or low pitched.\nSuspect told victim he was sent to (?) Lodge State Prison (possibly Deer Lodge State Prison), Montana, for a killing. While there (in prison) he killed a guard while escaping. Suspect also told victims he was heading for Mexico, told victim he was flat broke.\nVictim observed cut-up rope in suspect's rear pocket (trouser's), also stated he was wearing a knife in a case (on belt) on his right side, near front of trousers. Knife description: Appeared to be a long bread knife, 12\"\" long blade, 3/4\"\" wide, hardwood handle, 2 brass rivets holding handle in place, cotton surgical tape wrapped approximately 1\"\" around handle of knife. Knife case possibly made of wood.\nVictim asked suspect if suspect's gun was loaded. Suspect removed magazine from handle of pistol and showed victim a bullet removed from gun, bullet described as a possible .45 caliber. Victim did not know what caliber the pistol was.\nSuspect had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him, suspect then tied victim SHEPARD's hands, then re-tied HARTNELL's hands, then tied both victims' ankles together, had victims lie on their stomachs. HARTNELL stated suspect said, \"\"I'm getting nervous.\"\" This was when suspect was tying MISS SHEPARD'S hands, in fact HARTNELL stated suspect got real shaky when he was tying MISS SHEPARD's hands.\nVictim HARTNELL then stated that without warning the suspect plunged his knife into the back of HARTNELL. Suspect did this repeatedly, HARTNELL stated he thinks six times. HARTNELL stated he pretended to be dead and the suspect went over to MISS SHEPARD and stabbed MISS SHEPARD repeatedly in the back, and when MISS SHEPARD turned her body over (on back), suspect stabbed her in the lower abdomen. Victim stated suspect stabbed MISS SHEPARD much worse than him. Suspect went into some sort of frenzy when stabbing MISS SHEPARD.\nVictim HARTNELL stated suspect left the area after the stabbing. Victim HARTNELL hailed a boat (off shore) and told the man in the boat the couple needed help badly. Victim stated the boat left the area and he (victim) attempted to get help by crawling and walking to the road. (Victim believed he had walked to the road, however had not gone too far from his wounded companion.)\nVictim stated he thought suspect had been with the couple for approximately fifteen (15) minutes from time of observing suspect until suspect departed. Victim stated suspect did not take his wallet, although when MISS SHEPARD was tying victim HARTNELL's hands, she reached in his pocket and threw his wallet to suspect. Suspect did not take the wallet or victim's car keys.\nVictim stated a man in a pickup truck found him on the road and called an ambulance. Victim stated he estimated one hour in time was involved between the time he and MISS SHEPARD were stabbed until help arrived.\nMISS SHEPARD is listed in critical condition.\n\n-------\n\nTranscript\nPage 1\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-321-F9-5861\nSgt. ROBERTSON stated that Mr. HARTNELL was heavily sedated but was able to give a verbal statement pertaining to the attack at Lake Berrysessa. The interview was taped and reads as follows:\n\"\"INTERVIEW OF JOHN ROBERTSON, DET/SGT., NAPA COUNTY SHERIFF's DEPARTMENT, WITH BRYAN CALVIN HARTNELL (NSO CASE #105907) AT QUEEN OF THE VALLEY HOSPITAL ON SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1969 (TRANSCRIBED FROM TAPE RECORDING BY M. FEURLE):\n\"\"J.R. Can you give me this fellow's description and tell me what happened?\n\"\"B.H. So many people have been asking me... I hope...\n\"\"J.R. Well sometimes when we're repetitious, I know it happens to me, I tell the same thing over and over and over, and sometimes I might vary a little, and if you do...\n\"\"B.H. Shall I just start out and tell you what happened?\n\"\"J.R. I don't want to tire you out.\n\"\"B.H. I just don't want this to happen again to anybody... Of course he might have his reasons, I don't know...\n\"\"J.R. Okay. Go right ahead. Start right from the beginning. What happened?\n\"\"B.H. Okay. This girl came out from school, I used to go with her two years ago, and she's now going to another school, and she came up to visit some friends and we were having dinner at the school cafeteria, and I said, 'Well, are you doing anything special this afternoon?' and she said, 'Why?', and I said, 'I don't know. We could go out and either go for a walk, go to San Francisco, or, you know, just...', 'cause we used to be good friends. We used to have a good friendship. And so it got too late by the time we got around to what we were going to do. We had to stop in St. Helena for a couple items and then we had to cart a couple kids home and stuff, and by the time we finally got around to it, it was getting late, and I thought going to San Francisco 'd rush you, you know, because by the time we got back for worship... And so we went out to Berryessa, and there was this one place I used to go out... we used to all the time, you know... and I couldn't find it. And so I figured Ah, forget it, and this looks like as good a place as any. So I parked the car, there were no other cars there. I had a Kharman Ghia, '56, white, with a black vinyl top, and it's in pretty\nPage 2\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n... \"\"good-looking shape. But we parked there on the road's edge and we talked Oh it must be about a quarter of a mile to down to the place where we went. We had... (unintelligible) peninsula, it's an an island I guess during the wetter season, You can see where it was levee... And so that looked like a lot... there was a big spreading tree up there. There were two of them, really, one was a little bigger than the other. We took the one that was out on the point.\n\"\"It was really beautiful out there. We were sitting on top... I lay down on my back and she lay down on her stomach beside me, you know, kind of resting her head on my shoulder, and we were talking, you know, kind of reminiscing about old times, and stuff. And I heard these rustling leaves, and I said, 'You have your specs on. Why don't you see what the deal is over there?' And she says, 'Oh, it's some man.' And I said, 'Is he alone?' and she said, 'Yeah... (unintelligible)...' and she says, 'Well he just stepped behind the tree.' And I said, 'What's the idea of that? To take a leak?' You know, 'cause that's the only thing I could think of, just step behind a tree. And so I says, 'Well, keep looking and tell me what happens,' and she says, 'Oh my God, he's got a gun!' and squeezed my arm and\n\"\"And so he came out, and of course still actually I wasn't... There's some things you really wouldn't mind having happen, just for the experience of it. You know I thought, Well I only got fifty cents on me. It's worth all of that having it happen. I didn't think about another angle. So I talked to him, you know. I said, 'Well listen, Mac, (you know I'm in the sociologist field, you know, I'm pre-law, with history and psych.) You know I've read about the criminal mind and everything, you know. I thought well maybe the guy really does need help, you know. I says, 'There's no strings attached.' I says, 'I don't have any money right now but if you need help that badly I can help you out in another way maybe.' And he says, 'Nah.. time's running short,' he says, ''cause I just got out of... some prison in Montana, I don't know what the name of it is. Feathers? Do you know what the name of it is? I'll see if it sounds familiar. Fern or Feathers? It's some double name, like Fern Lock or something...\n\"\"J.R. It's Lodge..\nPage 3\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. Oh yeah, yeah, Lodge. At least we know we're together on that.\n\"\"J.R. Mountain Lodge Prison, or something of that nature...\n\"\"B.H. Yeah. You know he said he broke out and had to kill a guard getting out. And I said, 'Well, man, I mean actually I don't mean to call your bluff or anything, but wouldn't you rather be stuck on a stealing charge than a threat of homicide?' you know? And he says, 'Well just don't start playing hero on me.' You know, 'Don't try to grab the gun,' 'cause I didn't really figure the gun was loaded. I always thought it would be empty. I've heard a lot of times that this is what they do just as a bluff, but I decided not to call his bluff after he really, you know... I told him, 'You know you're really wasting your time with me. I've got a billfold and this much change and that's it.' And he said, he told the girl, 'Go tie him up. I'd feel much better if you were tied up.' And she tied a couple of loose knots on me, so I made it look kind of tight... (unintelligible)... you know, just for a second, and he said 'Go ahead.' And I whispered to her, 'You know I think I can get that gun.' And I said, 'Do you mind?' and she got kind of fearful about it, so I figured since there's two lives involved, not just mine, I won't do it.\n\"\"So I let her tie me up on the wrists again, and he tied her up, - terribly tight, you know, real... (unintelligible) ... put his gun away, and we were talking and all, bantering, you know, basically. I was thinking, anything I can do to help, by the way just to keep the conversation going... Suddenly he was taking it all seriously, you know... So I was starting out and finally he said, 'Okay, lay down. I've got her tied up', you know... He strung a rope between our ankles in the rear, so we were like this, you know, on our stomachs, tied...\n\"\"J.R. You both facing the ground...\n\"\"B.H. Right. And, oh, this was before. I got sort of ahead. So anyway, he said, 'Get down,' and I said, 'Oh come on! We could freeze to death!' I said that a couple, three times, and he said, 'GET DOWN! RIGHT NOW!' He got a little pushed off at me. So I got down and then he finished tying her up and clonked her down, - and then he goes... Sswhooosh (a sound with his mouth)... (unintelligible)\nPage 4\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"And so I said, 'Do you have bullets in there?' And so he pulled out the clip and showed me that he did. The bullets were about this long, I can remember, and about this fat, and they had the regular red cap on it, about this long. Maybe that doesn't give you any better description of the gun or not. I don't know. And it came out of the heel, the grip, you know. It slipped out from the bottom.\n\"\"And now, to backtrack a bit. I was really trying to see what he looked like, you know. He had on pleated pants, these old type of suit pants, you know, and they were either black or dark blue, I can't remember now. And I can't remember what he was wearing for shoes. But he had on this cotton coat, You've seen the kind, that you just turn the collar up once, there's a zipper down the front, you know. They're real light, super-thin, you know...\n\"\"J.R. Kind of a windbreaker...\n\"\"B.H. Yeah, like a windbreaker. And it's got this blue, this little collar, sometimes the guys wear them standing up, you know.\n\"\"J.R. What color was that?\n\"\"B.H. That was dark blue. And I don't know. Maybe he had something in his pouch. I just took it as being a... as being a... you know, he was stout 'cause he looked kind of heavy. I think he was weighing two and a quarter, two fifty, somewhere in there. And I got kind of a look at his hair. His voice... I can remember... almost like I'd heard it before. You know there's some drawls that a lot of people have similar. And... almost as if I'd heard it before... couldn't think where.\n\"\"I gave that one up, I just gave it up on that angle. I looked through his hair. I kind of looked like it was combed, you know, like this.. it was a brownish, you know, dark brown hair.\n\"\"And this mask he had on. It was ingeniously devised. It was... he had four corners at the top, like the top of a paper sack... black. It came down, came down, with the front panel about to here, and a kind of a thing that came over the shoulders, you know, and then the same thing down the back, straight down. And in the front he had a circle with a symmetrical cross in the middle. You know what I mean by a symmetrical cross?\nPage 5\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. Um hum (affirmative).\n\"\"B.H. The ends of the cross hung out about this far on each of the... you know, where it came out. The circle was this much... like this... and then it was like this, you see... hung out on the end, over the edge of the circle.\n\"\"And he had clip-on sunglasses... it was hard to tell. You know, the sunglasses you clip on when you're wearing glasses, eyeglasses, He had those clipped on. I'm pretty sure... I don't think he had glasses, though. I think he just had these clipped on to his suit... you know, that little mask.\n\"\"And I don't know how tall he was. Maybe 5-8 or maybe 5-10, 6 feet, somewhere in there. I'm a very poor judge of height because of my height. I have no meaning, you know. It's always down, you know. It can never be up...\n\"\"And so I saw him put away his gun, and I was turning to say something to Celia, and all of a sudden I felt my back... just... no, I think I saw him pull it out.. I don't remember... I think I saw him whip out his knife and just start stabbing me in the back... CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP! I was just (makes a gutteral sound)... you know that kind of a sound... and Celia turned to see why I was (repeats gutteral sound), you know, and she just about fainted. She went hysterical... (unintelligible) ... and when he finally stopped... I mean he went over and... The doctor says there's six in the back, six wounds on my back. You ought to confirm that. One I've got went clear through the lung. I've got it draining. I did drain a couple pints of blood out as soon as I got here. I lost an awful lot of blood, I guess.\n\"\"We were down... I mean it was absolutely no question in my mind... when a person gets stabbed as many times as we did... we were going to die. I mean there'd be no reason to question it. But somehow I, you know, started (unintelligible)... I just knew there was too much I had to live for. I mean really it does happen... about getting depressed and everything... when you're young you always think about these things... you know you think about it... and when you've got someone forcing your hand, oh well, there was a lot of things I had to do. And what really kept me going... you know my parents are pretty Christian. I haven't been too much of a Christian myself... but if you believe in the principle you ask God to help you. Another thing, What was my only strength was knowing two things. One, that I did not want to die, and two, that I felt that whatever was\nPage 6\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n\"\"going to be was going to be, but I was going to try my damnedest to stay alive. And so, like I say, - before I left her I kissed her, and I said, 'Well,' I says, 'I'm gonna try to get help.'\n\"\"There was a boat kept circling around out there in the lake and we started yelling at it and finally it came within about 100 yards of the shore and turned off its motor and stayed there watching us for about fifteen minutes, and we were just screaming hysterically, trying to get their attention, you know, to come over here. Oh, I don't know, I guess they were afraid that the guy might be there in the bushes and they were liable to get choked or something. So finally he came up a little closer. I didn't have my glasses on... I was just swaying, you know... and I had gotten one of her hands free before they came, and so I kept trying to get her to untie me, and she couldn't, she was too weak, she said.\n\"\"So finally I just kept hollering and hollering, and she said, 'Turn around and let's see if I can do it again.' She finally got it. My hands and my feet were just pure numbness... they're still numb but I'm sure that will go 'way. But I finally got... (unintelligible)... untie her so she could kind of relax out. 'Cause it was a terrible position, you know, upon our stomachs... (unintelligible)...\n\"\"And so I started to go for help. I finally got myself fairly reconciled. I wasn't too worried about dying, if that was what was going to happen, but I knew I had to keep pushing on. I had to force myself into staying alive because it was... I could just see myself... you know, all sort of waves would come over... I just (coughing sound)... (unintelligible)... 'Well, you're not gonna give up this easy', you know. And, like I say, I just kept believing that God would do everything the best, if the thing was gonna happen, but I couldn't see any reason why my dying would be the best good. So I just played along with that.\n\"\"I just started to walk toward the road... everything blacked out on me... my visual... my mind was never blacked out, but my visual was. So I lay down... My eyes started to come open... I just saw a haze of trees, you know. In a little while I got up and went another twenty feet, and then the same thing happened... (unintelligible)... and sat down. Next thing I went clear... (unintelligible)... the road, and by that time I just fell... I just... I was trying so hard to go far I just went too far. Finally I heard this pickup\nPage 7\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"coming... I was just laying alongside the road, and that's where this guy picked me up.\n\"\"They weren't in any hurry at all, it didn't seem like, you know, but they finally called an ambulance. About fifteen minutes later it came... (unintelligible)... but I still believe... I've got feeling... starting to get a little pain to come through. But from the minute that knife blade went in, it was nothing but pure shock from there on. I just did not expect it. I didn't expect that he would do that. That was a variable I had completely left out. And I guess he just took off running after we started running. I don't know. I never saw him before and hope not to see him again... at least outside of a courtroom.\n\"\"It's hard for me to explain much more. I mean I'm trying to give you a kind of example of his technique. He had some rope cut up in his back pocket. And he had a ... well, I thought it was a police automatic because it was in one of these black leather cases, you know...\n\"\"J.R. Was it in a smooth case, or did it have a basket weave like..\n\"\"B.H. Can I have my glasses? Oh, they're not here. It was a smooth one, though.\n\"\"J.R. Did he have this hood down to about the middle of his chest?\n\"\"B.H. No, about like... well, I'll show you... Here... his stomach.. You know I could see his... (voice fades away)\n\"\"J.R. Okay. You said his hair looked dark brown. How could you see his hair?\n\"\"B.H. 'Cause I saw it from where those goggles fit. I looked so closely to find out. And when he turned you know they kind of flittered... I could see his hair. It looked kind of greasy.\n\"\"J.R. Now was he as heavy as I am?\n\"\"B.H. Well I can't say 'cause he wasn't wearing those type of clothes. They were sloppy clothes, you know. And he just had on this old pair of pleated pants. I don't know... How tall are you?\n\"\"J.R. I'm about five eleven.\nPage 8\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. Well, like I say, he was dressed kind of sloppily, you know. His pants real tight up here and his stomach kind of pouched a bit, you know. I don't know... it's hard to say 'cause I can't judge you with being in a suit and all, you know, and him not being professional-looking at all. He could be about the same. It's hard to say. He was so sloppily dressed.\n\"\"J.R. Bryan, you also mentioned a drawl. Well not a drawl, an accent.\n\"\"B.H. It was just something... I guess his way of talking. It was something I couldn't repeat. It's like a song. Sometimes you know what you're going to say but you just can't sing the melody worth a darn.\n\"\"J.R. Did he have a throaty voice or a high pitched?\n\"\"B.H. In between. But it was just a unique way of talking.\n\"\"J.R. Did he sound like an educated man?\n\"\"B.H. Heck no! I don't think so.\n\"\"J.R. Did he sound illiterate?\n\"\"B.H. No. He didn't sound that way either. He just impressed me as being rather low class. The reason was because of his clothes, you know.\n\"\"J.R. Did you lose consciousness when he stabbed you at any time? Did you observe him stab Cecelia?\n\"\"B.H. Yeah...\n\"\"J.R. What did he say after...\n\"\"B.H. He stabbed her a bunch of times in the back. After she turned around, he got her once in the groin and one in the arm I think. He kind of went a little more hog-wild with her than with me. I faked dead... like that... I didn't want him to come back and give me some more.\n\"\"J.R. So you were pretty sure he thought you were dead when he finished working on you?\nPage 9\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. I think he kind of thought that. Of course I don't know because we started talking right after he left. It's hard to say... (unintelligible)... I don't think she fainted either.\n\"\"J.R. Was she in a lot of pain, did she tell you?\n\"\"B.H. Oh yeah. She was more weak at the time... (unintelligible).. from the religious angle. I told her I sure as heck wasn't going to have any deathbed conversion. 'No,' she says... (unintelligible)... I mean it was just like you were gonna die and had a few things to say. But I felt more and more I wasn't losing strength as much... (unintelligible)... that I thought I could cope with...\n\"\"J.R. What you did was a courageous thing. It was a terrible thing to have happen to anyone.\n\"\"B.H. Well there was nothing we could do. We were kind of at the mercy of him. I mean I wanted to get that gun... (unintelligible)... There was a time I think I could have gotten it...\n\"\"J.R. Did it appear to be a .45 to you? An automatic?\n\"\"B.H.

Did the bullet look anything like that?\n\"\"B.H. No. It was kind of like this, only it was gold, and this part here came out along with this and then round the gold, round the blunt end. Not quite that blunt-ended, though.\n\"\"J.R. Was it fat? Fatter than this?\n\"\"B.H. Yeah, I think it was a little fatter. But it was gold, you know. And I didn't see any of this here. There was a part where it crimped... Well, almost like that 22, short, only a lot bigger.

BYRD advised that MISS JUDY was a student at the college and had left the college earlier in the afternoon, driving a yellow Datsun. At 2135 hours Reporting Officers put out an All Points Bulletin around the City and County of Napa for this above described vehicle. At 2137 hours Officers received permission to interview the victim BRYAN HARTNELL who was taken to the X-Ray Room for x-rays. Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Lonergan attempted to interview BRYAN HARTNELL while in the presence of DONALD JUDAH and hospital attendant CLIFFORD MEAGHER. Sgt. Narlow was called away to answer a phone before the interview got under way. HARTNELL appeared to be in extreme pain and also appeared to be in shock. Reporting Officer Lonergan introduced himself to HARTNELL and asked him to give us any information he had on his assailant. HARTNELL stated that the assailant was wearing a black ceremonial type hood, square on top, and appeared to be heavy-set, between 200 and 250 pounds. He also stated his assailant had approached both him and MISS SHEPARD with a gun but had stabbed them with a long knife. HARTNELL further stated the gun was in a black holster and the knife was in a sheath. He stated that the attacker was wearing dark clothing, dark jacket and dark pants. HARTNELL further stated that the gun was an automatic pistol and the knife had a black handle and appeared to be homemade.\nIt should be noted that HARTNELL was very groggy and he was very difficult to interview at that time. Subject was re-interviewed the next day by Det/Sgt. Robertson and gave more complete details. (The report of Sgt. Robertson's interview is attached.)\nAt 2215 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan left the Queen of the Valley Hospital after advising Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and William Munk to take charge of the clothing of the victims and any other evidence from the victims when it was released from the hospital. Munk and Brambrink were also advised to stand by at the hospital as a security measure until other arrangements could be made.\nAs Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan were arriving at the Napa County Sheriff's Office, they were advised by the Napa Police Department that they had located MISS JUDY in the downtown Napa area and were bringing her to the Napa County Sheriff's Office. MISS [JUDY] was interviewed by Lonergan and Narlow at the Napa County Sheriff's Office. She was further identified as MISS JUDITH, a student at Pacific Union College, with a permanent residence address of Sun Valley, California. MISS [JUDITH] advised that she was with BRYAN\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

She stated that they all left Pacific Union College together at approximately 1:00 P.M. and went to a rummage sale in the City of St. Helena. She stated that BRYAN had bought a T.V. set at the rummage sale and had to transport it back to his room at Pacific Union College. She stated he left CECELIA at the rummage sale as there was not enough room in his car. MISS [JUDITH] stated BRYAN returned to the St. Helena area and picked up CECELIA at approximately 2:00 P.M. MISS [JUDITH] stated as far as she knew, both BRYAN and CECELIA were planning to go to San Francisco when they left her in St. Helena. MISS [JUDITH] stated she had no knowledge of any plans that BRYAN and CECELIA were making to go to the Lake Berryessa area. MISS [JUDITH] stated the last time she saw BRYAN and CECELIA was approximately 2:00 P.M. in the afternoon.\nThe interview with MISS [JUDITH] was terminated at that point.\nDet/Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow then proceeded to Lake Berryessa and arrived at the scene of the crime, which was approximately a mile and a half north of Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters, at 2354 hours. The scene was being preserved by uniformed officers and under the direct control of Deputy Sheriffs David Collins and Ray Land. The investigating officers were briefed by Officers Collins and Land as to what had taken place prior to our arrival. Officers observed a 1956 white Kharman Ghia with a black vinyl top, Oregon license plate 4 U 2040. Investigating officers were shown footprints in dirt area and tire tracks, both believed to have been left by responsible. Investigating officers awaited the arrival of Sgt. Tom Butler who had been called to take photographs of the crime scene area and Sgt. Hal Snook, criminalist for collection and preservation of physical evidence. R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were advised by Park Ranger Dennis Land who had also arrived at the scene that it was possible to get to the beach area by vehicle from a locked gate approximately one-half mile south of the victim's vehicle. Officers proceeded to the area and arrived at the footpath approximately halfway between the scene of the crime at the beach and the victim's vehicle on the road. At that point, after a brief examination of the footpath area, officers discovered a similar footprint on the footpath to that found at the scene of the victim's vehicle. At that point, due to the lateness and darkness of the hour, Reporting Officers decided to completely secure the area and make a thorough search of the scene at first light. Officers then exited the crime scene area in the same manner and locked the aforementioned gate leading to this vicinity. Investigating officers along with Park Ranger Dennis Land went to the Berryessa Park Headquarters.\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

These items consisted of a blanket, a pair of man's shoes, a wallet belonging to BRYAN HARTNELL, eyeglasses, and playing cards. Among the various aforementioned items believed to belong to the victims, were numerous strands of white plastic line cut into various assorted lengths, some of which had what appeared to be bloodstains. These items were subsequently turned over to Det/Sgt. Hal Snook for preservation.\nAssigned investigators then proceeded back to the scene where the victim's car was parked and assisted Sgt. Snook in the making of the plaster casts. At approximately 0245 hours Sgt. Lonergan, having previously obtained the keys to the vehicle from BRYAN HARTNELL's property at Queen of the Valley Hospital, drove the white Kharman Ghia to the maintenance shop at Berryessa Park Headquarters. The vehicle was parked inside of the maintenance shop building and the building was secured for the evening by investigating officers with the assistance of Park Ranger Dennis Land. Assigned Investigators then returned back to the scene where the victim's vehicle had been previously parked and awaited the arrival of Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and Mel Fechter who were assigned to security duty in the crime scene area. At approximately 0300 hours officers assumed their duties at the crime scene area and the security was placed under the direction of Deputy Allen Brambrink. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then returned to their respective residences with plans to continue the investigation at daybreak.\n9/28/69 0700 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene at Lake Berryessa area, accompanied by Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Capt. Donald Townsend, and Sgt. James Munk. Officers then assisted Det/Sgt. Snook in tracking the footprints from the vehicle to the scene of the crime by the beach area. (The location and preservation of aforementioned footprints will be detailed in a supplementary evidence report by Sgt. Snook.)\nAt 0800 hours Reporting Officers Lonergan and Narlow received information via Park Headquarters that a DR. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his son would like to talk to them at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop regarding a possible suspect in this crime. At 0912 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan contacted DR. R. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his 16-yr. old son DAVID LEE RAYFIELD at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop. DR. RAYFIELD gave a home address of Los Gatos, California. DR. RAYFIELD stated that about 6:30 P.M. the previous evening he and his son had parked their car north of Park Headquarters in the general area of the\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts.

They stated they went down towards the beach area when DAVID RAYFIELD noticed a white male adult subject walking in the area, described as about 5'10\"\", heavy build, wearing dark trousers, a dark shirt with red in it, long sleeves. He stated this subject was carrying nothing in his hands and was apparently just walking alongside the hill area about halfway between the road and the lake. DAVID further stated that when the subject observed him he turned around and walked up the hill in a southerly direction. DR. RAYFIELD and his son stated that they did not notice a vehicle in the area of their vehicle and only this subject at a distance of about 100 yards. They also advised there was a man with two young boys in the area shooting B-B guns, but they did not know if this man saw the subject or not. This location was approximately 8/10ths of a mile from the scene of the victim's vehicle. In the opinion of R/Os, it is unlikely, unless this male subject had a vehicle in the immediate area, he could have traversed the area to the scene of the crime on foot. There are four coves of water between the scene of the crime and the area where the doctor saw the subject. The interview with DR. RAYFIELD and his son was terminated at that point.\nAt 1000 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene of the crime and further assisted Sgt. Snook in the collecting and locating of evidence.\nAt 1320 hours 9/28/69, R/Os interviewed Ranger Sgt. William White at Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters. White was interviewed as to his activities before and during his part in locating the victims the night before. White stated at approximately 1855 hours 9/27/69 he was on routine patrol around the Lake Berryessa area when he received a call from Park Headquarters to proceed to the Rancho Monticello Resort where a person was reporting a possible stabbing. \nWhite stated he proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort where he was contacted by ARCHIE E. WHITE, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG. RONALD FONG advised him that he had seen a male and a female victim on the beach area south of Rancho Monticello Resort, hollering that they had been stabbed. Ranger Sgt. White, accompanied by ARCHIE WHITE, ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the beach area via speedboat owned by ARCHIE WHITE. When they arrived on the beach they observed a young female lying on the ground with what appeared to be numerous stab wounds. Ranger Sgt. White stated that the female appeared to be in a great deal of pain. White stated as they discovered the female victim, Ranger Dennis Land arrived at the scene in his pickup truck, carrying a male victim who also appeared to have numerous stab wounds. White stated he immediately radioed in and had Park Headquarters call the Sheriff's Office to dispatch an ambulance and a Deputy. White stated he attempted to interview both the boy and girl victims while awaiting\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

According to White, the male victim said that a male subject approached them, wearing a hood, dressed in dark clothing. The subject was carrying what appeared to be an automatic pistol and stated that he wanted their money and car keys. According to White, the male victim related to him that the subject advised him he was an ex-con out of Colorado and was en route to Mexico. Suspect stated he had to tie them up, and after they were tied the responsible stated, \"\"I'm going to have to stab you.\"\" White further related that the male victim advised the responsible, \"\"Stab me first, I can't stand to see her stabbed first.\"\" The male victim then advised that the responsible stabbed him numerous times in the back and then stabbed the girl.\nThe female victim advised White that she could not see the responsible's face as a hood was covering all of his head. She also advised White that the suspect had what appeared to be clip-on sunglasses to cover his eyes. Ranger Sgt. White stated that this is the most he could get out of either victim as they were both in great shock and pain. White stated that he noticed a lot of blood near the girl's groin area. The interview with Ranger Sgt. White was terminated at that point.\n9/28/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort and interviewed MR. ARCHIE E. WHITE. (It should be noted that ARCHIE E. WHITE and ELIZABETH WHITE are no relation to Ranger Sgt. White.) ARCHIE E. WHITE is the owner of the Boat Repair Shop at Rancho Monticello Resort. He lives at the Resort. Also interviewed were MR. WHITE's wife, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE. MR. and MRS. WHITE advised that they were contacted by RONALD FONG who advised them he had just observed what appeared to be a male and a female subject lying on the beach south of the Rancho Monticello Resort, covered with blood. FONG advised them that the couple had shouted out to him that they had been stabbed and robbed. MRS. WHITE immediately called Park Headquarters and Ranger Sgt. William White arrived at the Resort a short time later. MR. and MRS. WHITE, accompanied by Ranger Sgt. Bill White and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the scene area in one of MR. WHITE's ski boats. When they arrived on the scene, they observed a young female wearing a sweater dress lying on the beach, covered with blood.

WHITE further advised that the female victim told her that the responsible was wearing glasses, with dark clip-on sunglasses over the hood. She told her that the responsible had a black pistol. MR. ARCHIE WHITE stated he overheard the male victim advise someone that the responsible was wearing gloves. MR. and MRS. WHITE further advised that this is the only information either victim gave them on the responsible, and that they spent the balance of the time attempting to make the victim more comfortable until the arrival of the ambulance.\nAfter the interview with MR. and MRS. WHITE, Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan returned to the Napa County Sheriff's Office.\nAt 1620 hours R/O Det/Sgt. Narlow was contacted by a DEAN of the Pacific Union College in Angwin. DEAN advised that three young ladies, students at the college, might possibly have information as to a suspect in the attack at Lake Berryessa. The young ladies were identified as MISS JOANNE, MISS LINDA, and MISS LINDA. DEAN advised that these girls had been in the Lake Berryessa area from about 3:00 P.M. to 4:30 P.M. the previous Saturday afternoon. They had observed a male subject in a late model, silver blue Chevrolet, two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. DEAN advised that the girls had told him they were observed out of the car by this subject while they were sunbathing on the beach. They described the subject as approximately 40 years old, [blank] feet tall, dressed in dark clothing. Sgt. Narlow dispatched Deputy Sheriff Raymond Land to interview these three girls that evening. (The report of Land's interview is attached.)\nReporting Officers spent the balance of the day and evening going through their investigative notes and issuing a statewide All Points Bulletin.\nMonday, 9/29/69 Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan spent the majority of the morning interviewing numerous citizens and officers from other departments regarding this crime and similar crimes. (A general list of possible suspects was begun and they are noted on separate incident reports as to origin of information and description of suspects, attached.)\nReporting Officers were advised by Deputy Sheriff Ray Land who interviewed the three college girls, MISS [JOANNE], MISS [LINDA], and MISS [LINDA] that the information appeared to have some merit and advised that the three young ladies would be in the office in the afternoon for further interview.\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgt.

MISS [JOANNE] advised R/O that on 9/27/69 at approximately 5:30 P.M. she and her two girlfriends parked their vehicle at a location two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. When they left their car they noticed a subject driving a late model silver blue Chevrolet, 2-door sedan, pull up behind them. What appeared to be a white male adult was sitting in the vehicle. They did not observe this subject leave the vehicle. The girls proceeded to the beach area and were sunbathing in their bikinis. After approximately one-half hour had passed, they observed what appeared to be the same subject standing within 40 or 50 feet of them, apparently observing them. This subject was described as 6' tall, weighing 200/210 lbs., muscular build, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing dark pants and a dark pullover shirt. The subject would stare at the three girls but when they looked up at him he would look away. The subject hung around the area for approximately 45 minutes and then the girls observed him walk up the hill. MISS [JOANNE] stated it was very doubtful that from his vantage point in the vehicle the subject could observe the three girls on the beach. She believes he waited in his vehicle and then followed them down after they were on the beach. MISS [JOANNE] further described the car as appearing very conservative. She stated the car did not appear to belong to any young person such as a teenager. She did state the car had California license plates but did not notice the number.\nThe other two young ladies, MISS [LINDA] and MISS [LINDA] were interviewed by Sgt. Snook and Capt.

Subject was wearing a black short-sleeved sweater shirt, bunched up in front, and a white tee shirt hanging out in back, and dark trousers. The three girls left the area about 4:30 P.M. and the subject's vehicle was gone. Witnesses did not observe the subject either leave or get back into his vehicle.\nMISS LINDA LEE was interviewed by R/O Capt. Donald Townsend. MISS [LINDA LEE] is a WFA, DOB [blank], address Howell Mountain Road, Angwin. MISS [LINDA LEE] is employed as a secretary of the college press. MISS [LINDA LEE] observed the same vehicle which was described as a late model Chevrolet, sky blue in color. The rear tail lights appeared to be long rather than round. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated they parked their vehicle at approximately 2:55 P.M. and observed the subject in his vehicle at that location. The girls proceeded to the beach and she, MISS [LINDA LEE], again noticed the subject about 30 to 45 minutes after they were at the beach. She noticed him standing on the bank approximately 45 yards from her location. She described the subject as 6 feet tall, stocky build, about 200 lbs., black short-sleeved sweater shirt, dark blue slacks, and straight dark hair neatly combed. She guessed his age at approximately 30 years. Subject had medium color skin and was not wearing glasses. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated she thought she saw a white belt around his back but it possibly was a tee shirt hanging out. She further stated that the man was fairly nice-looking, with a round face. She did not observe the subject leave the area in his vehicle.\n9/29/69 - 1600 hours Reporting Officers Sgt. Narlow and Sgt. Lonergan were advised by Capt.

DE PETRIS would complete the autopsy.\nAt 1945 hours 9/29/69, R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were contacted by Probation Officer H. B. Schotte. Mr. Schotte had observed the footprint design that R/Os had taken at the scene and stated he had knowledge of a possible similar shoe sole design. Mr. Schotte brought into the office a MR.

He described these boots as being Government issue, issued to all Air Force personnel at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. They are primarily designed as a wing-walker shoe, however according to MR. [BASSEL] most Air Force personnel and many of the civilian personnel employed at Air Force bases had this type of shoe. The sole design of this shoe exactly matched the plaster cast design that Sgt. Snook had taken at the scene of the crime. It should be noted that Det/Sgt John Robertson had attempted to find a similar shoe design at the local shoe stores in the Napa area with negative results. (Refer Sgt. Robertson's supplementary report.) MR. [BASSEL] was asked if we could keep his shoes for identification purposes and he agreed. R/Os was also advised that this information regarding the type of footprint had not been released to the press or general public. MR.

Kenneth Narlow contacted CAPT. at Travis Air Force Base and arranged for an interview with COL. and SGT. to take place on Wednesday morning, October 1st, 1969, at 9:00 A.M. R/Os wanted to talk to someone at Travis regarding the shoeprints that were found on the scene. The remainder of the day and evening was spent in answering phone calls from people who had possible knowledge of the crime.\nWednesday, 10/1/69 - 0900 hours Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow went to Travis Air Force Base and were present at an interview in Col. office, who is Commanding Officer in charge of base security. Also present at this meeting besides the aforementioned officers was LT. COL. of the Office of Special Investigation. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan advised the Air Force personnel present of the portion of the evidence we had discovered at the crime scene and asked them for assistance in locating where this type of shoe was sold or issued. LT. COL. advised that his office would assist assigned investigators in attempting to locate the source of the shoe.\nOfficers were directed to the Base Supply with the assistance of Special Agent DONALD of O.S.I., at which time it was determined through Base Supply that this shoe in question was of Government issue and that it was not kept in stock at Base Supply, however it was believed that the Sales Store had such an item. It was then explained that if a military person or civilian employee was determined to be in need of such an item, he first reported to the Base Supply, at which time he was issued a purchase requisition which he in turn took to the Sales Store and the type of shoe was issued to the individual and they in turn required the individual to sign the purchase requisition showing that he did receive the item. This purchase requisition states the type of shoe that the individual was to receive, however makes no reference as to size.\nAssigned investigators, accompanied by Special Agent proceeded to the Sales Store located on Travis Air Force Base. After a short period of time R/Os located in stock a shoe fitting the identical description of the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast which officers had in their possession. The identical shoe with identical tread was found and a shoe bearing the closest measurements in the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast was measured and found to be a size 10 1/2 in military styling or a 10 1/2 D in civilian equivalent. It was determined through Air Force records that they were unable to furnish officers with the\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

Air Force records indicate this type shoe is manufactured by the International Shoe Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, then shipped to Air Force Depot, Ogden, Utah, and from there shipped to the various military installations upon requisition orders.\n10/1/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then proceeded to the Vallejo Police Department and met with Sgt. Jack Mullanax and Sgt. Duane Nilsson. Officers exchanged information regarding Vallejo's crime of 7/4/69 and our particular incident. Suspect information was exchanged and is listed in the separate suspect file.\nInvestigating Officers checked to determine the validity of the decoded message and as to how far the original cyphers had been decoded. It was then learned that the message had been decoded by at least two different sources, one being by MR. and MRS. HARDIN of Salinas and the other by the FBI in Washington. It was noted that these cyphers were broken independent of one another and the FBI confirmed the validity of the original decoded message. It was also learned that there was a small portion on the very end of the coded message that had not been decoded for reasons unknown.\nThe balance of the afternoon and evening Reporting Officers and other investigating officers met to exchange information and further discuss the evidence at hand.\nThursday, October 2nd, 1969, 0845 hours Reporting Officer Lonergan received a telephone call from Special Agent, OSI, Travis Air Force Base.

Agent further related he has the names of all the subjects who have purchased this item through surplus and will keep these names available to officers upon request.\nThe balance of the morning was spent searching fingerprint evidence and answering phone calls from possible witnesses.\nThursday, 10/2/69, 1400 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan attended the funeral services for victim CECELIA SHEPARD.

[JAMES] had previously reported that this subject had left the hospital on a pass Friday evening, 9/26/69, and returned to the hospital Monday afternoon, 9/29/69. This subject also had spent time in the Air Force and was discharged from the Air Force in January 1969 for psychiatric problems. According to the doctors at the hospital, this subject was capable of committing this type of a crime. R/O in the presence of JAMES and Security Officer PHIL RYAN interviewed subject FRANKLIN. FRANKLIN was very cooperative and talkative to R/O and went over his activities the prior weekend. Briefly stated, MR. FRANKLIN, whose parents live in Vallejo, never left the Vallejo area that weekend and stayed around home talking with his mother, stepfather, and three brothers. After interviewing subject, it was the opinion of R/O Sgt. Lonergan that this subject was not the responsible. He had a definite very fast manner of speaking which was completely opposed to the victim's statement concerning the suspect's voice. R/O also contacted the mother of the suspect, a MRS. OPAL at Hollywood Avenue, Vallejo. MRS. OPAL stated more or less the exact same thing that her son had stated as to his whereabouts that weekend. It appears that this subject has a reliable alibi as to his activities and had no access to a vehicle that weekend.

ROBERTSON stated that Mr. HARTNELL was heavily sedated but was able to give a verbal statement pertaining to the attack at Lake Berrysessa. The interview was taped and reads as follows:\n\"\"INTERVIEW OF JOHN ROBERTSON, DET/SGT., NAPA COUNTY SHERIFF's DEPARTMENT, WITH BRYAN CALVIN HARTNELL (NSO CASE #105907) AT QUEEN OF THE VALLEY HOSPITAL ON SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1969 (TRANSCRIBED FROM TAPE RECORDING BY M. FEURLE):\n\"\"J.R. Can you give me this fellow's description and tell me what happened?\n\"\"B.H. So many people have been asking me... I hope...\n\"\"J.R. Well sometimes when we're repetitious, I know it happens to me, I tell the same thing over and over and over, and sometimes I might vary a little, and if you do...\n\"\"B.H. Shall I just start out and tell you what happened?\n\"\"J.R. I don't want to tire you out.\n\"\"B.H. I just don't want this to happen again to anybody... Of course he might have his reasons, I don't know...\n\"\"J.R. Okay. Go right ahead. Start right from the beginning. What happened?\n\"\"B.H. Okay. This girl came out from school, I used to go with her two years ago, and she's now going to another school, and she came up to visit some friends and we were having dinner at the school cafeteria, and I said, 'Well, are you doing anything special this afternoon?' and she said, 'Why?', and I said, 'I don't know. We could go out and either go for a walk, go to San Francisco, or, you know, just...', 'cause we used to be good friends. We used to have a good friendship. And so it got too late by the time we got around to what we were going to do. We had to stop in St. Helena for a couple items and then we had to cart a couple kids home and stuff, and by the time we finally got around to it, it was getting late, and I thought going to San Francisco 'd rush you, you know, because by the time we got back for worship... And so we went out to Berryessa, and there was this one place I used to go out... we used to all the time, you know... and I couldn't find it. And so I figured Ah, forget it, and this looks like as good a place as any. So I parked the car, there were no other cars there. I had a Kharman Ghia, '56, white, with a black vinyl top, and it's in pretty\nPage 2\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n... \"\"good-looking shape. But we parked there on the road's edge and we talked Oh it must be about a quarter of a mile to down to the place where we went. We had... (unintelligible) peninsula, it's an an island I guess during the wetter season, You can see where it was levee... And so that looked like a lot... there was a big spreading tree up there. There were two of them, really, one was a little bigger than the other. We took the one that was out on the point.\n\"\"It was really beautiful out there. We were sitting on top... I lay down on my back and she lay down on her stomach beside me, you know, kind of resting her head on my shoulder, and we were talking, you know, kind of reminiscing about old times, and stuff. And I heard these rustling leaves, and I said, 'You have your specs on. Why don't you see what the deal is over there?' And she says, 'Oh, it's some man.' And I said, 'Is he alone?' and she said, 'Yeah... (unintelligible)...' and she says, 'Well he just stepped behind the tree.' And I said, 'What's the idea of that? To take a leak?' You know, 'cause that's the only thing I could think of, just step behind a tree. And so I says, 'Well, keep looking and tell me what happens,' and she says, 'Oh my God, he's got a gun!' and squeezed my arm and\n\"\"And so he came out, and of course still actually I wasn't... There's some things you really wouldn't mind having happen, just for the experience of it. You know I thought, Well I only got fifty cents on me. It's worth all of that having it happen. I didn't think about another angle. So I talked to him, you know. I said, 'Well listen, Mac, (you know I'm in the sociologist field, you know, I'm pre-law, with history and psych.) You know I've read about the criminal mind and everything, you know. I thought well maybe the guy really does need help, you know. I says, 'There's no strings attached.' I says, 'I don't have any money right now but if you need help that badly I can help you out in another way maybe.' And he says, 'Nah.. time's running short,' he says, ''cause I just got out of... some prison in Montana, I don't know what the name of it is. Feathers? Do you know what the name of it is? I'll see if it sounds familiar. Fern or Feathers? It's some double name, like Fern Lock or something...\n\"\"J.R. It's Lodge..\nPage 3\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. Oh yeah, yeah, Lodge. At least we know we're together on that.\n\"\"J.R. Mountain Lodge Prison, or something of that nature...\n\"\"B.H. Yeah. You know he said he broke out and had to kill a guard getting out. And I said, 'Well, man, I mean actually I don't mean to call your bluff or anything, but wouldn't you rather be stuck on a stealing charge than a threat of homicide?' you know? And he says, 'Well just don't start playing hero on me.' You know, 'Don't try to grab the gun,' 'cause I didn't really figure the gun was loaded. I always thought it would be empty. I've heard a lot of times that this is what they do just as a bluff, but I decided not to call his bluff after he really, you know... I told him, 'You know you're really wasting your time with me. I've got a billfold and this much change and that's it.' And he said, he told the girl, 'Go tie him up. I'd feel much better if you were tied up.' And she tied a couple of loose knots on me, so I made it look kind of tight... (unintelligible)... you know, just for a second, and he said 'Go ahead.' And I whispered to her, 'You know I think I can get that gun.' And I said, 'Do you mind?' and she got kind of fearful about it, so I figured since there's two lives involved, not just mine, I won't do it.\n\"\"So I let her tie me up on the wrists again, and he tied her up, - terribly tight, you know, real... (unintelligible) ... put his gun away, and we were talking and all, bantering, you know, basically. I was thinking, anything I can do to help, by the way just to keep the conversation going... Suddenly he was taking it all seriously, you know... So I was starting out and finally he said, 'Okay, lay down. I've got her tied up', you know... He strung a rope between our ankles in the rear, so we were like this, you know, on our stomachs, tied...\n\"\"J.R. You both facing the ground...\n\"\"B.H. Right. And, oh, this was before. I got sort of ahead. So anyway, he said, 'Get down,' and I said, 'Oh come on! We could freeze to death!' I said that a couple, three times, and he said, 'GET DOWN! RIGHT NOW!' He got a little pushed off at me. So I got down and then he finished tying her up and clonked her down, - and then he goes... Sswhooosh (a sound with his mouth)... (unintelligible)\nPage 4\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"And so I said, 'Do you have bullets in there?' And so he pulled out the clip and showed me that he did. The bullets were about this long, I can remember, and about this fat, and they had the regular red cap on it, about this long. Maybe that doesn't give you any better description of the gun or not. I don't know. And it came out of the heel, the grip, you know. It slipped out from the bottom.\n\"\"And now, to backtrack a bit. I was really trying to see what he looked like, you know. He had on pleated pants, these old type of suit pants, you know, and they were either black or dark blue, I can't remember now. And I can't remember what he was wearing for shoes. But he had on this cotton coat, You've seen the kind, that you just turn the collar up once, there's a zipper down the front, you know. They're real light, super-thin, you know...\n\"\"J.R. Kind of a windbreaker...\n\"\"B.H. Yeah, like a windbreaker. And it's got this blue, this little collar, sometimes the guys wear them standing up, you know.\n\"\"J.R. What color was that?\n\"\"B.H. That was dark blue. And I don't know. Maybe he had something in his pouch. I just took it as being a... as being a... you know, he was stout 'cause he looked kind of heavy. I think he was weighing two and a quarter, two fifty, somewhere in there. And I got kind of a look at his hair. His voice... I can remember... almost like I'd heard it before. You know there's some drawls that a lot of people have similar. And... almost as if I'd heard it before... couldn't think where.\n\"\"I gave that one up, I just gave it up on that angle. I looked through his hair. I kind of looked like it was combed, you know, like this.. it was a brownish, you know, dark brown hair.\n\"\"And this mask he had on. It was ingeniously devised. It was... he had four corners at the top, like the top of a paper sack... black. It came down, came down, with the front panel about to here, and a kind of a thing that came over the shoulders, you know, and then the same thing down the back, straight down. And in the front he had a circle with a symmetrical cross in the middle. You know what I mean by a symmetrical cross?\nPage 5\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. Um hum (affirmative).\n\"\"B.H. The ends of the cross hung out about this far on each of the... you know, where it came out. The circle was this much... like this... and then it was like this, you see... hung out on the end, over the edge of the circle.\n\"\"And he had clip-on sunglasses... it was hard to tell. You know, the sunglasses you clip on when you're wearing glasses, eyeglasses, He had those clipped on. I'm pretty sure... I don't think he had glasses, though. I think he just had these clipped on to his suit... you know, that little mask.\n\"\"And I don't know how tall he was. Maybe 5-8 or maybe 5-10, 6 feet, somewhere in there. I'm a very poor judge of height because of my height. I have no meaning, you know. It's always down, you know. It can never be up...\n\"\"And so I saw him put away his gun, and I was turning to say something to Celia, and all of a sudden I felt my back... just... no, I think I saw him pull it out.. I don't remember... I think I saw him whip out his knife and just start stabbing me in the back... CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP! I was just (makes a gutteral sound)... you know that kind of a sound... and Celia turned to see why I was (repeats gutteral sound), you know, and she just about fainted. She went hysterical... (unintelligible) ... and when he finally stopped... I mean he went over and... The doctor says there's six in the back, six wounds on my back. You ought to confirm that. One I've got went clear through the lung. I've got it draining. I did drain a couple pints of blood out as soon as I got here. I lost an awful lot of blood, I guess.\n\"\"We were down... I mean it was absolutely no question in my mind... when a person gets stabbed as many times as we did... we were going to die. I mean there'd be no reason to question it. But somehow I, you know, started (unintelligible)... I just knew there was too much I had to live for. I mean really it does happen... about getting depressed and everything... when you're young you always think about these things... you know you think about it... and when you've got someone forcing your hand, oh well, there was a lot of things I had to do. And what really kept me going... you know my parents are pretty Christian. I haven't been too much of a Christian myself... but if you believe in the principle you ask God to help you. Another thing, What was my only strength was knowing two things. One, that I did not want to die, and two, that I felt that whatever was\nPage 6\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n\"\"going to be was going to be, but I was going to try my damnedest to stay alive. And so, like I say, - before I left her I kissed her, and I said, 'Well,' I says, 'I'm gonna try to get help.'\n\"\"There was a boat kept circling around out there in the lake and we started yelling at it and finally it came within about 100 yards of the shore and turned off its motor and stayed there watching us for about fifteen minutes, and we were just screaming hysterically, trying to get their attention, you know, to come over here. Oh, I don't know, I guess they were afraid that the guy might be there in the bushes and they were liable to get choked or something. So finally he came up a little closer. I didn't have my glasses on... I was just swaying, you know... and I had gotten one of her hands free before they came, and so I kept trying to get her to untie me, and she couldn't, she was too weak, she said.\n\"\"So finally I just kept hollering and hollering, and she said, 'Turn around and let's see if I can do it again.' She finally got it. My hands and my feet were just pure numbness... they're still numb but I'm sure that will go 'way. But I finally got... (unintelligible)... untie her so she could kind of relax out. 'Cause it was a terrible position, you know, upon our stomachs... (unintelligible)...\n\"\"And so I started to go for help. I finally got myself fairly reconciled. I wasn't too worried about dying, if that was what was going to happen, but I knew I had to keep pushing on. I had to force myself into staying alive because it was... I could just see myself... you know, all sort of waves would come over... I just (coughing sound)... (unintelligible)... 'Well, you're not gonna give up this easy', you know. And, like I say, I just kept believing that God would do everything the best, if the thing was gonna happen, but I couldn't see any reason why my dying would be the best good. So I just played along with that.\n\"\"I just started to walk toward the road... everything blacked out on me... my visual... my mind was never blacked out, but my visual was. So I lay down... My eyes started to come open... I just saw a haze of trees, you know. In a little while I got up and went another twenty feet, and then the same thing happened... (unintelligible)... and sat down. Next thing I went clear... (unintelligible)... the road, and by that time I just fell... I just... I was trying so hard to go far I just went too far. Finally I heard this pickup\nPage 7\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"coming... I was just laying alongside the road, and that's where this guy picked me up.\n\"\"They weren't in any hurry at all, it didn't seem like, you know, but they finally called an ambulance. About fifteen minutes later it came... (unintelligible)... but I still believe... I've got feeling... starting to get a little pain to come through. But from the minute that knife blade went in, it was nothing but pure shock from there on. I just did not expect it. I didn't expect that he would do that. That was a variable I had completely left out. And I guess he just took off running after we started running. I don't know. I never saw him before and hope not to see him again... at least outside of a courtroom.\n\"\"It's hard for me to explain much more. I mean I'm trying to give you a kind of example of his technique. He had some rope cut up in his back pocket. And he had a ... well, I thought it was a police automatic because it was in one of these black leather cases, you know...\n\"\"J.R. Was it in a smooth case, or did it have a basket weave like..\n\"\"B.H. Can I have my glasses? Oh, they're not here. It was a smooth one, though.\n\"\"J.R. Did he have this hood down to about the middle of his chest?\n\"\"B.H. No, about like... well, I'll show you... Here... his stomach.. You know I could see his... (voice fades away)\n\"\"J.R. Okay. You said his hair looked dark brown. How could you see his hair?\n\"\"B.H. 'Cause I saw it from where those goggles fit. I looked so closely to find out. And when he turned you know they kind of flittered... I could see his hair. It looked kind of greasy.\n\"\"J.R. Now was he as heavy as I am?\n\"\"B.H. Well I can't say 'cause he wasn't wearing those type of clothes. They were sloppy clothes, you know. And he just had on this old pair of pleated pants. I don't know... How tall are you?\n\"\"J.R. I'm about five eleven.\nPage 8\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. Well, like I say, he was dressed kind of sloppily, you know. His pants real tight up here and his stomach kind of pouched a bit, you know. I don't know... it's hard to say 'cause I can't judge you with being in a suit and all, you know, and him not being professional-looking at all. He could be about the same. It's hard to say. He was so sloppily dressed.\n\"\"J.R. Bryan, you also mentioned a drawl. Well not a drawl, an accent.\n\"\"B.H. It was just something... I guess his way of talking. It was something I couldn't repeat. It's like a song. Sometimes you know what you're going to say but you just can't sing the melody worth a darn.\n\"\"J.R. Did he have a throaty voice or a high pitched?\n\"\"B.H. In between. But it was just a unique way of talking.\n\"\"J.R. Did he sound like an educated man?\n\"\"B.H. Heck no! I don't think so.\n\"\"J.R. Did he sound illiterate?\n\"\"B.H. No. He didn't sound that way either. He just impressed me as being rather low class. The reason was because of his clothes, you know.\n\"\"J.R. Did you lose consciousness when he stabbed you at any time? Did you observe him stab Cecelia?\n\"\"B.H. Yeah...\n\"\"J.R. What did he say after...\n\"\"B.H. He stabbed her a bunch of times in the back. After she turned around, he got her once in the groin and one in the arm I think. He kind of went a little more hog-wild with her than with me. I faked dead... like that... I didn't want him to come back and give me some more.\n\"\"J.R. So you were pretty sure he thought you were dead when he finished working on you?\nPage 9\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. I think he kind of thought that. Of course I don't know because we started talking right after he left. It's hard to say... (unintelligible)... I don't think she fainted either.\n\"\"J.R. Was she in a lot of pain, did she tell you?\n\"\"B.H. Oh yeah. She was more weak at the time... (unintelligible).. from the religious angle. I told her I sure as heck wasn't going to have any deathbed conversion. 'No,' she says... (unintelligible)... I mean it was just like you were gonna die and had a few things to say. But I felt more and more I wasn't losing strength as much... (unintelligible)... that I thought I could cope with...\n\"\"J.R. What you did was a courageous thing. It was a terrible thing to have happen to anyone.\n\"\"B.H. Well there was nothing we could do. We were kind of at the mercy of him. I mean I wanted to get that gun... (unintelligible)... There was a time I think I could have gotten it...\n\"\"J.R. Did it appear to be a .45 to you? An automatic?\n\"\"B.H. It was about this long... along the stock... and had a wood edge on it, you know.. on either side...\n\"\"J.R. Handles.\n\"\"B.H. Yeah...yeah...\n\"\"J.R. Did the bullet look anything like that?\n\"\"B.H. No. It was kind of like this, only it was gold, and this part here came out along with this and then round the gold, round the blunt end. Not quite that blunt-ended, though.\n\"\"J.R. Was it fat? Fatter than this?\n\"\"B.H. Yeah, I think it was a little fatter. But it was gold, you know. And I didn't see any of this here. There was a part where it crimped... Well, almost like that 22, short, only a lot bigger. It was about like this length, maybe more stubby.\nPage 10\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n\"\"J.R. Well I'll get a .45 a little later and we can bring it up and let you observe it.\n\"\"B.H. \"\"Let's take the suspect. His hands... I don't remember if they had gloves on or not. I can't remember now. I keep thinking that he had gloves on. I can't figure how he tied us... Let's ask Celia, she probably knows about that.\n\"\"J.R. Did he swear? Did he use any profane language or obscenity?\n\"\"B.H. I don't think so. If he did it was no more than I was using at the time. I don't think he used any obscenity. He might have used a swear word or something, you know. That wasn't striking to me...\n\"\"J.R. Do you have any idea what his motive might have been? Money?\n\"\"B.H. Money. He said he was going to go to Mexico and he was flat broke.\n\"\"J.R. Did he search you after he...\n\"\"B.H. Heck no! Very unprofessional. He didn't even end up taking that loose change and didn't even take my billfold.\n\"\"J.R. Why did he stab you when you weren't fighting him off or anything?\n\"\"B.H. I couldn't. Even if I'd have wanted to. I was laying on my stomach...\n\"\"J.R. So what would have been the purpose of him to stab you, do you think?\n\"\"B.H. Well I (unintelligible)...but I think he got rattled... (unintelligible)... very, very nervous. His hands were shaking... (unintelligible)... Are you nervous?\n\"\"J.R. I'm just curious. If you could write me that symbol you were telling me about. Do you think you could draw me a picture of that even without your glasses?\n\"\"B.H. Um hum (affirmative). (Draws)... kind of like that. I can't see very well...\nPage 11\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. Yes, I see. Okay...\n\"\"B.H. ... (unintelligible)... that I could really die...\n\"\"J.R. Does this ring a bell?\n\"\"B.H. This one here. This is more like it, but I'm not sure. It was distinctly that design. It was thick. More thick marks.\n\"\"J.R. Okay. What color was this? Do you recall?\n\"\"B.H. Black. And that was white.\n\"\"J.R. This was black.\n\"\"B.H. No, that was white. It was about this tall.\n\"\"J.R. Two and a half, three inches?\n\"\"B.H. About four by four... three by three...\n\"\"J.R. How do you feel? Am I tiring you out too much?\n\"\"B.H. No. I've had a couple shots. It's not hurting me at all.\n\"\"J.R. Do you think Cecelia could tell me any more than you have already told me? Add anything?\n\"\"B.H. (unintelligible)\n\"\"J.R. Did he slap you around? Slap her?\n\"\"B.H. (unintelligible)... No.\n\"\"J.R. He was a much smaller man than you?\n\"\"B.H. Not much. About your height I guess. I don't know.\n\"\"J.R. Well you're getting kind of sleepy. I'll ease up on you.\n\"\"B.H. Have you gotten any clues at all?\n\"\"J.R. Yes, we've got some good clues. Before we get this guy it's going to take a lot of work.\n\"\"B.H. Remember he said he was headed for Mexico,\nPage 12\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. He's headed for Mexico?\n\"\"B.H.

CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his son would like to talk to them at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop regarding a possible suspect in this crime. \nAt 0912 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan contacted DR. R. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his 16-yr. old son DAVID LEE RAYFIELD at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop. DR. RAYFIELD gave a home address of Los Gatos, California. DR. RAYFIELD stated that about 6:30 P.M. the previous evening he and his son had parked their car north of Park Headquarters in the general area of the crime scene. \nThey stated they went down towards the beach area when DAVID RAYFIELD noticed a white male adult subject walking in the area, described as about 5'10\"\", heavy build, wearing dark trousers, a dark shirt with red in it, long sleeves. He stated this subject was carrying nothing in his hands and was apparently just walking alongside the hill area about halfway between the road and the lake. DAVID further stated that when the subject observed him he turned around and walked up the hill in a southerly direction. DR. RAYFIELD and his son stated that they did not notice a vehicle in the area of their vehicle and only this subject at a distance of about 100 yards. \nThey also advised there was a man with two young boys in the area shooting B-B guns, but they did not know if this man saw the subject or not. This location was approximately 8/10ths of a mile from the scene of the victim's vehicle. In the opinion of R/Os, it is unlikely, unless this male subject had a vehicle in the immediate area, he could have traversed the area to the scene of the crime on foot. There are four coves of water between the scene of the crime and the area where the doctor saw the subject. The interview with DR. RAYFIELD and his son was terminated at that point.\n\",,\"rec7Fue7MIOL0uRL6,recwRee0DtTX3tRVn,reccRBkzVCjHazVUW,recIgEVcAF0n18DST\",,,,reczLS0i9zVkwmRCs,recguCeqiWgWqR24q,1969,September,Sunday,\"recmQK2TtG43z2t8t,reck7vmxrcURSt5gU\",Case Event,1969-09-28T09:12:00.000Z,9/28/1969 9:12AM,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Narlow%20and%20Lonergan%20interview%20Rayfields&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Narlow%20and%20Lonergan%20interview%20Rayfields&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2025-09-27T18:11:41.000Z,9:12 AM,,1969-09-28T09:12:00.000Z,The_Napa_Valley_Register_1967_08_04_14.jpg (data/media/attucXhPC3KScpW6R_The_Napa_Valley_Register_1967_08_04_14.jpg),\"Title: NCSD Report on Lake Berryessa\n\nDate: 1969-10-05T00:00:00.000Z\n\nAuthor / Source: Napa County Sheriff's Department, Ken Narlow, Richard Lonergan, David Lee Rayfield, R.

BYRD advised that MISS JUDY was a student at the college and had left the college earlier in the afternoon, driving a yellow Datsun. At 2135 hours Reporting Officers put out an All Points Bulletin around the City and County of Napa for this above described vehicle. At 2137 hours Officers received permission to interview the victim BRYAN HARTNELL who was taken to the X-Ray Room for x-rays. Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Lonergan attempted to interview BRYAN HARTNELL while in the presence of DONALD JUDAH and hospital attendant CLIFFORD MEAGHER. Sgt. Narlow was called away to answer a phone before the interview got under way. HARTNELL appeared to be in extreme pain and also appeared to be in shock. Reporting Officer Lonergan introduced himself to HARTNELL and asked him to give us any information he had on his assailant. HARTNELL stated that the assailant was wearing a black ceremonial type hood, square on top, and appeared to be heavy-set, between 200 and 250 pounds. He also stated his assailant had approached both him and MISS SHEPARD with a gun but had stabbed them with a long knife. HARTNELL further stated the gun was in a black holster and the knife was in a sheath. He stated that the attacker was wearing dark clothing, dark jacket and dark pants. HARTNELL further stated that the gun was an automatic pistol and the knife had a black handle and appeared to be homemade.\nIt should be noted that HARTNELL was very groggy and he was very difficult to interview at that time. Subject was re-interviewed the next day by Det/Sgt. Robertson and gave more complete details. (The report of Sgt. Robertson's interview is attached.)\nAt 2215 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan left the Queen of the Valley Hospital after advising Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and William Munk to take charge of the clothing of the victims and any other evidence from the victims when it was released from the hospital. Munk and Brambrink were also advised to stand by at the hospital as a security measure until other arrangements could be made.\nAs Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan were arriving at the Napa County Sheriff's Office, they were advised by the Napa Police Department that they had located MISS JUDY in the downtown Napa area and were bringing her to the Napa County Sheriff's Office. MISS [JUDY] was interviewed by Lonergan and Narlow at the Napa County Sheriff's Office. She was further identified as MISS JUDITH, a student at Pacific Union College, with a permanent residence address of Sun Valley, California. MISS [JUDITH] advised that she was with BRYAN\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

She stated that they all left Pacific Union College together at approximately 1:00 P.M. and went to a rummage sale in the City of St. Helena. She stated that BRYAN had bought a T.V. set at the rummage sale and had to transport it back to his room at Pacific Union College. She stated he left CECELIA at the rummage sale as there was not enough room in his car. MISS [JUDITH] stated BRYAN returned to the St. Helena area and picked up CECELIA at approximately 2:00 P.M. MISS [JUDITH] stated as far as she knew, both BRYAN and CECELIA were planning to go to San Francisco when they left her in St. Helena. MISS [JUDITH] stated she had no knowledge of any plans that BRYAN and CECELIA were making to go to the Lake Berryessa area. MISS [JUDITH] stated the last time she saw BRYAN and CECELIA was approximately 2:00 P.M. in the afternoon.\nThe interview with MISS [JUDITH] was terminated at that point.\nDet/Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow then proceeded to Lake Berryessa and arrived at the scene of the crime, which was approximately a mile and a half north of Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters, at 2354 hours. The scene was being preserved by uniformed officers and under the direct control of Deputy Sheriffs David Collins and Ray Land. The investigating officers were briefed by Officers Collins and Land as to what had taken place prior to our arrival. Officers observed a 1956 white Kharman Ghia with a black vinyl top, Oregon license plate 4 U 2040. Investigating officers were shown footprints in dirt area and tire tracks, both believed to have been left by responsible. Investigating officers awaited the arrival of Sgt. Tom Butler who had been called to take photographs of the crime scene area and Sgt. Hal Snook, criminalist for collection and preservation of physical evidence. R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were advised by Park Ranger Dennis Land who had also arrived at the scene that it was possible to get to the beach area by vehicle from a locked gate approximately one-half mile south of the victim's vehicle. Officers proceeded to the area and arrived at the footpath approximately halfway between the scene of the crime at the beach and the victim's vehicle on the road. At that point, after a brief examination of the footpath area, officers discovered a similar footprint on the footpath to that found at the scene of the victim's vehicle. At that point, due to the lateness and darkness of the hour, Reporting Officers decided to completely secure the area and make a thorough search of the scene at first light. Officers then exited the crime scene area in the same manner and locked the aforementioned gate leading to this vicinity. Investigating officers along with Park Ranger Dennis Land went to the Berryessa Park Headquarters.\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

These items consisted of a blanket, a pair of man's shoes, a wallet belonging to BRYAN HARTNELL, eyeglasses, and playing cards. Among the various aforementioned items believed to belong to the victims, were numerous strands of white plastic line cut into various assorted lengths, some of which had what appeared to be bloodstains. These items were subsequently turned over to Det/Sgt. Hal Snook for preservation.\nAssigned investigators then proceeded back to the scene where the victim's car was parked and assisted Sgt. Snook in the making of the plaster casts. At approximately 0245 hours Sgt. Lonergan, having previously obtained the keys to the vehicle from BRYAN HARTNELL's property at Queen of the Valley Hospital, drove the white Kharman Ghia to the maintenance shop at Berryessa Park Headquarters. The vehicle was parked inside of the maintenance shop building and the building was secured for the evening by investigating officers with the assistance of Park Ranger Dennis Land. Assigned Investigators then returned back to the scene where the victim's vehicle had been previously parked and awaited the arrival of Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and Mel Fechter who were assigned to security duty in the crime scene area. At approximately 0300 hours officers assumed their duties at the crime scene area and the security was placed under the direction of Deputy Allen Brambrink. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then returned to their respective residences with plans to continue the investigation at daybreak.\n9/28/69 0700 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene at Lake Berryessa area, accompanied by Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Capt. Donald Townsend, and Sgt. James Munk. Officers then assisted Det/Sgt. Snook in tracking the footprints from the vehicle to the scene of the crime by the beach area. (The location and preservation of aforementioned footprints will be detailed in a supplementary evidence report by Sgt. Snook.)\nAt 0800 hours Reporting Officers Lonergan and Narlow received information via Park Headquarters that a DR. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his son would like to talk to them at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop regarding a possible suspect in this crime. At 0912 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan contacted DR. R. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his 16-yr. old son DAVID LEE RAYFIELD at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop. DR. RAYFIELD gave a home address of Los Gatos, California. DR. RAYFIELD stated that about 6:30 P.M. the previous evening he and his son had parked their car north of Park Headquarters in the general area of the\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts.

They stated they went down towards the beach area when DAVID RAYFIELD noticed a white male adult subject walking in the area, described as about 5'10\"\", heavy build, wearing dark trousers, a dark shirt with red in it, long sleeves. He stated this subject was carrying nothing in his hands and was apparently just walking alongside the hill area about halfway between the road and the lake. DAVID further stated that when the subject observed him he turned around and walked up the hill in a southerly direction. DR. RAYFIELD and his son stated that they did not notice a vehicle in the area of their vehicle and only this subject at a distance of about 100 yards. They also advised there was a man with two young boys in the area shooting B-B guns, but they did not know if this man saw the subject or not. This location was approximately 8/10ths of a mile from the scene of the victim's vehicle. In the opinion of R/Os, it is unlikely, unless this male subject had a vehicle in the immediate area, he could have traversed the area to the scene of the crime on foot. There are four coves of water between the scene of the crime and the area where the doctor saw the subject. The interview with DR. RAYFIELD and his son was terminated at that point.\nAt 1000 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene of the crime and further assisted Sgt. Snook in the collecting and locating of evidence.\nAt 1320 hours 9/28/69, R/Os interviewed Ranger Sgt. William White at Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters. White was interviewed as to his activities before and during his part in locating the victims the night before. White stated at approximately 1855 hours 9/27/69 he was on routine patrol around the Lake Berryessa area when he received a call from Park Headquarters to proceed to the Rancho Monticello Resort where a person was reporting a possible stabbing. \nWhite stated he proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort where he was contacted by ARCHIE E. WHITE, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG. RONALD FONG advised him that he had seen a male and a female victim on the beach area south of Rancho Monticello Resort, hollering that they had been stabbed. Ranger Sgt. White, accompanied by ARCHIE WHITE, ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the beach area via speedboat owned by ARCHIE WHITE. When they arrived on the beach they observed a young female lying on the ground with what appeared to be numerous stab wounds. Ranger Sgt. White stated that the female appeared to be in a great deal of pain. White stated as they discovered the female victim, Ranger Dennis Land arrived at the scene in his pickup truck, carrying a male victim who also appeared to have numerous stab wounds. White stated he immediately radioed in and had Park Headquarters call the Sheriff's Office to dispatch an ambulance and a Deputy. White stated he attempted to interview both the boy and girl victims while awaiting\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

According to White, the male victim said that a male subject approached them, wearing a hood, dressed in dark clothing. The subject was carrying what appeared to be an automatic pistol and stated that he wanted their money and car keys. According to White, the male victim related to him that the subject advised him he was an ex-con out of Colorado and was en route to Mexico. Suspect stated he had to tie them up, and after they were tied the responsible stated, \"\"I'm going to have to stab you.\"\" White further related that the male victim advised the responsible, \"\"Stab me first, I can't stand to see her stabbed first.\"\" The male victim then advised that the responsible stabbed him numerous times in the back and then stabbed the girl.\nThe female victim advised White that she could not see the responsible's face as a hood was covering all of his head. She also advised White that the suspect had what appeared to be clip-on sunglasses to cover his eyes. Ranger Sgt. White stated that this is the most he could get out of either victim as they were both in great shock and pain. White stated that he noticed a lot of blood near the girl's groin area. The interview with Ranger Sgt. White was terminated at that point.\n9/28/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort and interviewed MR. ARCHIE E. WHITE. (It should be noted that ARCHIE E. WHITE and ELIZABETH WHITE are no relation to Ranger Sgt. White.) ARCHIE E. WHITE is the owner of the Boat Repair Shop at Rancho Monticello Resort. He lives at the Resort. Also interviewed were MR. WHITE's wife, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE. MR. and MRS. WHITE advised that they were contacted by RONALD FONG who advised them he had just observed what appeared to be a male and a female subject lying on the beach south of the Rancho Monticello Resort, covered with blood. FONG advised them that the couple had shouted out to him that they had been stabbed and robbed. MRS. WHITE immediately called Park Headquarters and Ranger Sgt. William White arrived at the Resort a short time later. MR. and MRS. WHITE, accompanied by Ranger Sgt. Bill White and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the scene area in one of MR. WHITE's ski boats. When they arrived on the scene, they observed a young female wearing a sweater dress lying on the beach, covered with blood. When they approached the area she was on her elbows and knees, rocking back and forth as if in great pain. MRS. WHITE stated she immediately attempted to make the victim more comfortable and tried to calm her down until the ambulance arrived. MRS. WHITE stated the girl advised him, \"\"He was a man with a hood... His face was covered... He was wearing black pants... It hurts, it\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts.

WHITE then advised after the female had regained her composure, she told her the man had asked for money but didn't take any. She said she hadn't been raped. MRS. WHITE further advised that the female victim told her that the responsible was wearing glasses, with dark clip-on sunglasses over the hood. She told her that the responsible had a black pistol. MR. ARCHIE WHITE stated he overheard the male victim advise someone that the responsible was wearing gloves. MR. and MRS. WHITE further advised that this is the only information either victim gave them on the responsible, and that they spent the balance of the time attempting to make the victim more comfortable until the arrival of the ambulance.\nAfter the interview with MR. and MRS. WHITE, Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan returned to the Napa County Sheriff's Office.\nAt 1620 hours R/O Det/Sgt. Narlow was contacted by a DEAN of the Pacific Union College in Angwin. DEAN advised that three young ladies, students at the college, might possibly have information as to a suspect in the attack at Lake Berryessa. The young ladies were identified as MISS JOANNE, MISS LINDA, and MISS LINDA. DEAN advised that these girls had been in the Lake Berryessa area from about 3:00 P.M. to 4:30 P.M. the previous Saturday afternoon. They had observed a male subject in a late model, silver blue Chevrolet, two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. DEAN advised that the girls had told him they were observed out of the car by this subject while they were sunbathing on the beach. They described the subject as approximately 40 years old, [blank] feet tall, dressed in dark clothing. Sgt. Narlow dispatched Deputy Sheriff Raymond Land to interview these three girls that evening. (The report of Land's interview is attached.)\nReporting Officers spent the balance of the day and evening going through their investigative notes and issuing a statewide All Points Bulletin.\nMonday, 9/29/69 Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan spent the majority of the morning interviewing numerous citizens and officers from other departments regarding this crime and similar crimes. (A general list of possible suspects was begun and they are noted on separate incident reports as to origin of information and description of suspects, attached.)\nReporting Officers were advised by Deputy Sheriff Ray Land who interviewed the three college girls, MISS [JOANNE], MISS [LINDA], and MISS [LINDA] that the information appeared to have some merit and advised that the three young ladies would be in the office in the afternoon for further interview.\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgt.

Lonergan, Sgt. Snook, and Capt. Donald Townsend.\nLonergan interviewed a MISS JOANNE MARIE, who, [age] years of age, DOB [blank], her address at the college is 114 Dauphine, Pacific Union College, home address South East 12th, College Place, Washington. MISS [JOANNE] advised R/O that on 9/27/69 at approximately 5:30 P.M. she and her two girlfriends parked their vehicle at a location two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. When they left their car they noticed a subject driving a late model silver blue Chevrolet, 2-door sedan, pull up behind them. What appeared to be a white male adult was sitting in the vehicle. They did not observe this subject leave the vehicle. The girls proceeded to the beach area and were sunbathing in their bikinis. After approximately one-half hour had passed, they observed what appeared to be the same subject standing within 40 or 50 feet of them, apparently observing them. This subject was described as 6' tall, weighing 200/210 lbs., muscular build, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing dark pants and a dark pullover shirt. The subject would stare at the three girls but when they looked up at him he would look away. The subject hung around the area for approximately 45 minutes and then the girls observed him walk up the hill. MISS [JOANNE] stated it was very doubtful that from his vantage point in the vehicle the subject could observe the three girls on the beach. She believes he waited in his vehicle and then followed them down after they were on the beach. MISS [JOANNE] further described the car as appearing very conservative. She stated the car did not appear to belong to any young person such as a teenager. She did state the car had California license plates but did not notice the number.\nThe other two young ladies, MISS [LINDA] and MISS [LINDA] were interviewed by Sgt. Snook and Capt. Donald Townsend.\nMISS LINDA who was interviewed by R/O Det/Sgt. Snook, is a WFA, DOB [blank], home address Sunnyside Road, Sanitarium. She stated she left the Angwin area with two other girls, JOANNE and LINDA at approximately 2:45 P.M. 9/27/69. The girls drove through Pope Valley to Lake Berryessa where they parked their vehicle two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand. MISS [LINDA] stated she observed a subject go into the parking lot area to the south. Subject went past their vehicle and backed up so their rear bumpers were nearly touching. Vehicle described as a 1966 or 1967 light blue Chevrolet with California plates. Witness believes the vehicle was a 2-door sedan and described the headlights as being long rather than round. The rear window glass was tinted quite dark. Another vehicle from Angwin with Arizona plates was in the parking area and witness saw the occupants, a MISS DENISE BROWN and a MR. WAYNE HAIGHT. The three girls went\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

After about 30 minutes the subject came down by the beach and passed within 20 feet of witness as he walked from south to north. Subject was described by MISS [LINDA] as approximately 28 years of age, 6' to 6'2\"\" tall, 200/225 lbs., black hair possibly styled, with a part on left, rounded eyes, thin lips, medium nose, straight eyebrows, small ears, well built, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing a black short-sleeved sweater shirt, bunched up in front, and a white tee shirt hanging out in back, and dark trousers. The three girls left the area about 4:30 P.M. and the subject's vehicle was gone. Witnesses did not observe the subject either leave or get back into his vehicle.\nMISS LINDA LEE was interviewed by R/O Capt. Donald Townsend. MISS [LINDA LEE] is a WFA, DOB [blank], address Howell Mountain Road, Angwin. MISS [LINDA LEE] is employed as a secretary of the college press. MISS [LINDA LEE] observed the same vehicle which was described as a late model Chevrolet, sky blue in color. The rear tail lights appeared to be long rather than round. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated they parked their vehicle at approximately 2:55 P.M. and observed the subject in his vehicle at that location. The girls proceeded to the beach and she, MISS [LINDA LEE], again noticed the subject about 30 to 45 minutes after they were at the beach. She noticed him standing on the bank approximately 45 yards from her location. She described the subject as 6 feet tall, stocky build, about 200 lbs., black short-sleeved sweater shirt, dark blue slacks, and straight dark hair neatly combed.

He described these boots as being Government issue, issued to all Air Force personnel at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. They are primarily designed as a wing-walker shoe, however according to MR. [BASSEL] most Air Force personnel and many of the civilian personnel employed at Air Force bases had this type of shoe. The sole design of this shoe exactly matched the plaster cast design that Sgt. Snook had taken at the scene of the crime. It should be noted that Det/Sgt John Robertson had attempted to find a similar shoe design at the local shoe stores in the Napa area with negative results. (Refer Sgt. Robertson's supplementary report.) MR. [BASSEL] was asked if we could keep his shoes for identification purposes and he agreed.

Kenneth Narlow contacted CAPT. at Travis Air Force Base and arranged for an interview with COL. and SGT. to take place on Wednesday morning, October 1st, 1969, at 9:00 A.M. R/Os wanted to talk to someone at Travis regarding the shoeprints that were found on the scene. The remainder of the day and evening was spent in answering phone calls from people who had possible knowledge of the crime.\nWednesday, 10/1/69 - 0900 hours Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow went to Travis Air Force Base and were present at an interview in Col. office, who is Commanding Officer in charge of base security. Also present at this meeting besides the aforementioned officers was LT. COL. of the Office of Special Investigation. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan advised the Air Force personnel present of the portion of the evidence we had discovered at the crime scene and asked them for assistance in locating where this type of shoe was sold or issued. LT. COL. advised that his office would assist assigned investigators in attempting to locate the source of the shoe.\nOfficers were directed to the Base Supply with the assistance of Special Agent DONALD of O.S.I., at which time it was determined through Base Supply that this shoe in question was of Government issue and that it was not kept in stock at Base Supply, however it was believed that the Sales Store had such an item. It was then explained that if a military person or civilian employee was determined to be in need of such an item, he first reported to the Base Supply, at which time he was issued a purchase requisition which he in turn took to the Sales Store and the type of shoe was issued to the individual and they in turn required the individual to sign the purchase requisition showing that he did receive the item. This purchase requisition states the type of shoe that the individual was to receive, however makes no reference as to size.\nAssigned investigators, accompanied by Special Agent proceeded to the Sales Store located on Travis Air Force Base. After a short period of time R/Os located in stock a shoe fitting the identical description of the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast which officers had in their possession. The identical shoe with identical tread was found and a shoe bearing the closest measurements in the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast was measured and found to be a size 10 1/2 in military styling or a 10 1/2 D in civilian equivalent. It was determined through Air Force records that they were unable to furnish officers with the\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

Air Force records indicate this type shoe is manufactured by the International Shoe Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, then shipped to Air Force Depot, Ogden, Utah, and from there shipped to the various military installations upon requisition orders.\n10/1/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then proceeded to the Vallejo Police Department and met with Sgt. Jack Mullanax and Sgt. Duane Nilsson. Officers exchanged information regarding Vallejo's crime of 7/4/69 and our particular incident. Suspect information was exchanged and is listed in the separate suspect file.\nInvestigating Officers checked to determine the validity of the decoded message and as to how far the original cyphers had been decoded. It was then learned that the message had been decoded by at least two different sources, one being by MR. and MRS. HARDIN of Salinas and the other by the FBI in Washington. It was noted that these cyphers were broken independent of one another and the FBI confirmed the validity of the original decoded message. It was also learned that there was a small portion on the very end of the coded message that had not been decoded for reasons unknown.\nThe balance of the afternoon and evening Reporting Officers and other investigating officers met to exchange information and further discuss the evidence at hand.\nThursday, October 2nd, 1969, 0845 hours Reporting Officer Lonergan received a telephone call from Special Agent, OSI, Travis Air Force Base. Subject called to report that approximately 500 to 1,000 of that type of wing-walker shoe have been sold as surplus on the Base. This would be over and above those sold at the Sales Store. Agent further related he has the names of all the subjects who have purchased this item through surplus and will keep these names available to officers upon request.\nThe balance of the morning was spent searching fingerprint evidence and answering phone calls from possible witnesses.\nThursday, 10/2/69, 1400 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan attended the funeral services for victim CECELIA SHEPARD. These services were held at the Pacific Union College Church, Angwin, California. Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan positioned themselves\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow\n- TYPED BY: M.

This included individual photographs and group scenes. Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow also attended the graveside services at the St. Helena Cemetery in St. Helena.\nFriday, 10/3/69 - Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Richard Lonergan contacted JAMES, Napa State Hospital, advised him to set up an interview with a patient who is a possible suspect in our case. The patient is identified as GRIFFIN RAYMOND FRANKLIN, WMA, 20 yrs. of age, DOB [blank], 6'2\"\", 223 lbs. [JAMES] had previously reported that this subject had left the hospital on a pass Friday evening, 9/26/69, and returned to the hospital Monday afternoon, 9/29/69. This subject also had spent time in the Air Force and was discharged from the Air Force in January 1969 for psychiatric problems. According to the doctors at the hospital, this subject was capable of committing this type of a crime. R/O in the presence of JAMES and Security Officer PHIL RYAN interviewed subject FRANKLIN. FRANKLIN was very cooperative and talkative to R/O and went over his activities the prior weekend. Briefly stated, MR. FRANKLIN, whose parents live in Vallejo, never left the Vallejo area that weekend and stayed around home talking with his mother, stepfather, and three brothers. After interviewing subject, it was the opinion of R/O Sgt. Lonergan that this subject was not the responsible. He had a definite very fast manner of speaking which was completely opposed to the victim's statement concerning the suspect's voice. R/O also contacted the mother of the suspect, a MRS. OPAL at Hollywood Avenue, Vallejo. MRS. OPAL stated more or less the exact same thing that her son had stated as to his whereabouts that weekend. It appears that this subject has a reliable alibi as to his activities and had no access to a vehicle that weekend. This subject was cleared as far as this crime is concerned.\nThe balance of the morning and afternoon was spent by R/Os Det/Sgts.

Victim stated he and MISS SHEPARD drove to Lake Berryessa, picked a large tree near the shore line where they decided to lie down and enjoy the scenery. While lying on the ground, victim HARTNELL stated he heard a noise and asked MISS SHEPARD if she could hear anything or see anything behind a tree not far from where the couple were lying. MISS SHEPARD told victim HARTNELL she could see a man behind the tree. HARTNELL asked her what he was doing. MISS SHEPARD stated she couldn't tell. HARTNELL stated he (suspect) then came from behind the tree. MISS SHEPARD said, \"\"Oh my God, he has a gun!\"\"\nVictim HARTNELL stated the man approached the couple, aiming a black steel automatic pistol. The suspect stated he needed a car and money. Suspect stated his car was \"\"hot\"\" and he wanted victim HARTNELL's car keys. Victim HARTNELL stated he began talking with the suspect, telling the suspect he had no money, only a small amount of change, also that if the suspect was really in need of assistance HARTNELL would attempt to help him. The suspect told victim to get on the ground. Suspect then had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him. HARTNELL stated he attempted to keep the suspect engaged in conversation while suspect was tying the victims.\nHARTNELL further stated the suspect was described as follows: Wearing a black hooded mask (cloth), covering suspect's entire head and shoulders, coming down almost to suspect's waist. Victim stated on front of the four-cornered type mask (similar to paper bag in style) there was a symbol, the symbol described as white, approximately 3 x 3 inches in diameter, with a symmetrical cross.

Suspect spoke with some\nPage 17\n(2)\ntype of drawl, but victim stated it was not a Southern drawl, did not really know what type of drawl, but thought the man was not well educated, but did not feel he was illiterate either. Victim said suspect's voice was moderate in sound, that is, not high or low pitched.\nSuspect told victim he was sent to (?) Lodge State Prison (possibly Deer Lodge State Prison), Montana, for a killing. While there (in prison) he killed a guard while escaping. Suspect also told victims he was heading for Mexico, told victim he was flat broke.\nVictim observed cut-up rope in suspect's rear pocket (trouser's), also stated he was wearing a knife in a case (on belt) on his right side, near front of trousers. Knife description: Appeared to be a long bread knife, 12\"\" long blade, 3/4\"\" wide, hardwood handle, 2 brass rivets holding handle in place, cotton surgical tape wrapped approximately 1\"\" around handle of knife. Knife case possibly made of wood.\nVictim asked suspect if suspect's gun was loaded. Suspect removed magazine from handle of pistol and showed victim a bullet removed from gun, bullet described as a possible .45 caliber. Victim did not know what caliber the pistol was.\nSuspect had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him, suspect then tied victim SHEPARD's hands, then re-tied HARTNELL's hands, then tied both victims' ankles together, had victims lie on their stomachs. HARTNELL stated suspect said, \"\"I'm getting nervous.\"\" This was when suspect was tying MISS SHEPARD'S hands, in fact HARTNELL stated suspect got real shaky when he was tying MISS SHEPARD's hands.\nVictim HARTNELL then stated that without warning the suspect plunged his knife into the back of HARTNELL. Suspect did this repeatedly, HARTNELL stated he thinks six times. HARTNELL stated he pretended to be dead and the suspect went over to MISS SHEPARD and stabbed MISS SHEPARD repeatedly in the back, and when MISS SHEPARD turned her body over (on back), suspect stabbed her in the lower abdomen. Victim stated suspect stabbed MISS SHEPARD much worse than him. Suspect went into some sort of frenzy when stabbing MISS SHEPARD.\nVictim HARTNELL stated suspect left the area after the stabbing. Victim HARTNELL hailed a boat (off shore) and told the man in the boat the couple needed help badly. Victim stated the boat left the area and he (victim) attempted to get help by crawling and walking to the road. (Victim believed he had walked to the road, however had not gone too far from his wounded companion.)\nVictim stated he thought suspect had been with the couple for approximately fifteen (15) minutes from time of observing suspect until suspect departed. Victim stated suspect did not take his wallet, although when MISS SHEPARD was tying victim HARTNELL's hands, she reached in his pocket and threw his wallet to suspect. Suspect did not take the wallet or victim's car keys.\nVictim stated a man in a pickup truck found him on the road and called an ambulance. Victim stated he estimated one hour in time was involved between the time he and MISS SHEPARD were stabbed until help arrived.\nMISS SHEPARD is listed in critical condition.\n\n-------\n\nTranscript\nPage 1\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-321-F9-5861\nSgt. ROBERTSON stated that Mr. HARTNELL was heavily sedated but was able to give a verbal statement pertaining to the attack at Lake Berrysessa. The interview was taped and reads as follows:\n\"\"INTERVIEW OF JOHN ROBERTSON, DET/SGT., NAPA COUNTY SHERIFF's DEPARTMENT, WITH BRYAN CALVIN HARTNELL (NSO CASE #105907) AT QUEEN OF THE VALLEY HOSPITAL ON SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1969 (TRANSCRIBED FROM TAPE RECORDING BY M. FEURLE):\n\"\"J.R. Can you give me this fellow's description and tell me what happened?\n\"\"B.H. So many people have been asking me... I hope...\n\"\"J.R. Well sometimes when we're repetitious, I know it happens to me, I tell the same thing over and over and over, and sometimes I might vary a little, and if you do...\n\"\"B.H. Shall I just start out and tell you what happened?\n\"\"J.R. I don't want to tire you out.\n\"\"B.H. I just don't want this to happen again to anybody... Of course he might have his reasons, I don't know...\n\"\"J.R. Okay. Go right ahead. Start right from the beginning. What happened?\n\"\"B.H. Okay. This girl came out from school, I used to go with her two years ago, and she's now going to another school, and she came up to visit some friends and we were having dinner at the school cafeteria, and I said, 'Well, are you doing anything special this afternoon?' and she said, 'Why?', and I said, 'I don't know. We could go out and either go for a walk, go to San Francisco, or, you know, just...', 'cause we used to be good friends. We used to have a good friendship. And so it got too late by the time we got around to what we were going to do. We had to stop in St. Helena for a couple items and then we had to cart a couple kids home and stuff, and by the time we finally got around to it, it was getting late, and I thought going to San Francisco 'd rush you, you know, because by the time we got back for worship... And so we went out to Berryessa, and there was this one place I used to go out... we used to all the time, you know... and I couldn't find it. And so I figured Ah, forget it, and this looks like as good a place as any. So I parked the car, there were no other cars there. I had a Kharman Ghia, '56, white, with a black vinyl top, and it's in pretty\nPage 2\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n... \"\"good-looking shape. But we parked there on the road's edge and we talked Oh it must be about a quarter of a mile to down to the place where we went. We had... (unintelligible) peninsula, it's an an island I guess during the wetter season, You can see where it was levee... And so that looked like a lot... there was a big spreading tree up there. There were two of them, really, one was a little bigger than the other. We took the one that was out on the point.\n\"\"It was really beautiful out there. We were sitting on top... I lay down on my back and she lay down on her stomach beside me, you know, kind of resting her head on my shoulder, and we were talking, you know, kind of reminiscing about old times, and stuff. And I heard these rustling leaves, and I said, 'You have your specs on. Why don't you see what the deal is over there?' And she says, 'Oh, it's some man.' And I said, 'Is he alone?' and she said, 'Yeah... (unintelligible)...' and she says, 'Well he just stepped behind the tree.' And I said, 'What's the idea of that? To take a leak?' You know, 'cause that's the only thing I could think of, just step behind a tree. And so I says, 'Well, keep looking and tell me what happens,' and she says, 'Oh my God, he's got a gun!' and squeezed my arm and\n\"\"And so he came out, and of course still actually I wasn't... There's some things you really wouldn't mind having happen, just for the experience of it. You know I thought, Well I only got fifty cents on me. It's worth all of that having it happen. I didn't think about another angle. So I talked to him, you know. I said, 'Well listen, Mac, (you know I'm in the sociologist field, you know, I'm pre-law, with history and psych.) You know I've read about the criminal mind and everything, you know. I thought well maybe the guy really does need help, you know. I says, 'There's no strings attached.' I says, 'I don't have any money right now but if you need help that badly I can help you out in another way maybe.' And he says, 'Nah.. time's running short,' he says, ''cause I just got out of... some prison in Montana, I don't know what the name of it is. Feathers? Do you know what the name of it is? I'll see if it sounds familiar. Fern or Feathers? It's some double name, like Fern Lock or something...\n\"\"J.R. It's Lodge..\nPage 3\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. Oh yeah, yeah, Lodge. At least we know we're together on that.\n\"\"J.R. Mountain Lodge Prison, or something of that nature...\n\"\"B.H. Yeah. You know he said he broke out and had to kill a guard getting out. And I said, 'Well, man, I mean actually I don't mean to call your bluff or anything, but wouldn't you rather be stuck on a stealing charge than a threat of homicide?' you know? And he says, 'Well just don't start playing hero on me.' You know, 'Don't try to grab the gun,' 'cause I didn't really figure the gun was loaded. I always thought it would be empty. I've heard a lot of times that this is what they do just as a bluff, but I decided not to call his bluff after he really, you know... I told him, 'You know you're really wasting your time with me. I've got a billfold and this much change and that's it.' And he said, he told the girl, 'Go tie him up. I'd feel much better if you were tied up.' And she tied a couple of loose knots on me, so I made it look kind of tight... (unintelligible)... you know, just for a second, and he said 'Go ahead.' And I whispered to her, 'You know I think I can get that gun.' And I said, 'Do you mind?' and she got kind of fearful about it, so I figured since there's two lives involved, not just mine, I won't do it.\n\"\"So I let her tie me up on the wrists again, and he tied her up, - terribly tight, you know, real... (unintelligible) ... put his gun away, and we were talking and all, bantering, you know, basically. I was thinking, anything I can do to help, by the way just to keep the conversation going... Suddenly he was taking it all seriously, you know... So I was starting out and finally he said, 'Okay, lay down. I've got her tied up', you know... He strung a rope between our ankles in the rear, so we were like this, you know, on our stomachs, tied...\n\"\"J.R. You both facing the ground...\n\"\"B.H. Right. And, oh, this was before. I got sort of ahead. So anyway, he said, 'Get down,' and I said, 'Oh come on! We could freeze to death!' I said that a couple, three times, and he said, 'GET DOWN! RIGHT NOW!' He got a little pushed off at me. So I got down and then he finished tying her up and clonked her down, - and then he goes... Sswhooosh (a sound with his mouth)... (unintelligible)\nPage 4\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"And so I said, 'Do you have bullets in there?' And so he pulled out the clip and showed me that he did. The bullets were about this long, I can remember, and about this fat, and they had the regular red cap on it, about this long. Maybe that doesn't give you any better description of the gun or not. I don't know. And it came out of the heel, the grip, you know. It slipped out from the bottom.\n\"\"And now, to backtrack a bit. I was really trying to see what he looked like, you know. He had on pleated pants, these old type of suit pants, you know, and they were either black or dark blue, I can't remember now. And I can't remember what he was wearing for shoes. But he had on this cotton coat, You've seen the kind, that you just turn the collar up once, there's a zipper down the front, you know. They're real light, super-thin, you know...\n\"\"J.R. Kind of a windbreaker...\n\"\"B.H. Yeah, like a windbreaker. And it's got this blue, this little collar, sometimes the guys wear them standing up, you know.\n\"\"J.R. What color was that?\n\"\"B.H. That was dark blue. And I don't know. Maybe he had something in his pouch. I just took it as being a... as being a... you know, he was stout 'cause he looked kind of heavy. I think he was weighing two and a quarter, two fifty, somewhere in there. And I got kind of a look at his hair. His voice... I can remember... almost like I'd heard it before. You know there's some drawls that a lot of people have similar. And... almost as if I'd heard it before... couldn't think where.\n\"\"I gave that one up, I just gave it up on that angle. I looked through his hair. I kind of looked like it was combed, you know, like this.. it was a brownish, you know, dark brown hair.\n\"\"And this mask he had on. It was ingeniously devised. It was... he had four corners at the top, like the top of a paper sack... black. It came down, came down, with the front panel about to here, and a kind of a thing that came over the shoulders, you know, and then the same thing down the back, straight down. And in the front he had a circle with a symmetrical cross in the middle. You know what I mean by a symmetrical cross?\nPage 5\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. Um hum (affirmative).\n\"\"B.H. The ends of the cross hung out about this far on each of the... you know, where it came out. The circle was this much... like this... and then it was like this, you see... hung out on the end, over the edge of the circle.\n\"\"And he had clip-on sunglasses... it was hard to tell. You know, the sunglasses you clip on when you're wearing glasses, eyeglasses, He had those clipped on. I'm pretty sure... I don't think he had glasses, though. I think he just had these clipped on to his suit... you know, that little mask.\n\"\"And I don't know how tall he was. Maybe 5-8 or maybe 5-10, 6 feet, somewhere in there. I'm a very poor judge of height because of my height. I have no meaning, you know. It's always down, you know. It can never be up...\n\"\"And so I saw him put away his gun, and I was turning to say something to Celia, and all of a sudden I felt my back... just... no, I think I saw him pull it out.. I don't remember... I think I saw him whip out his knife and just start stabbing me in the back... CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP! I was just (makes a gutteral sound)... you know that kind of a sound... and Celia turned to see why I was (repeats gutteral sound), you know, and she just about fainted. She went hysterical... (unintelligible) ... and when he finally stopped... I mean he went over and... The doctor says there's six in the back, six wounds on my back. You ought to confirm that. One I've got went clear through the lung. I've got it draining. I did drain a couple pints of blood out as soon as I got here. I lost an awful lot of blood, I guess.\n\"\"We were down... I mean it was absolutely no question in my mind... when a person gets stabbed as many times as we did... we were going to die. I mean there'd be no reason to question it. But somehow I, you know, started (unintelligible)... I just knew there was too much I had to live for. I mean really it does happen... about getting depressed and everything... when you're young you always think about these things... you know you think about it... and when you've got someone forcing your hand, oh well, there was a lot of things I had to do. And what really kept me going... you know my parents are pretty Christian. I haven't been too much of a Christian myself... but if you believe in the principle you ask God to help you. Another thing, What was my only strength was knowing two things. One, that I did not want to die, and two, that I felt that whatever was\nPage 6\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n\"\"going to be was going to be, but I was going to try my damnedest to stay alive. And so, like I say, - before I left her I kissed her, and I said, 'Well,' I says, 'I'm gonna try to get help.'\n\"\"There was a boat kept circling around out there in the lake and we started yelling at it and finally it came within about 100 yards of the shore and turned off its motor and stayed there watching us for about fifteen minutes, and we were just screaming hysterically, trying to get their attention, you know, to come over here. Oh, I don't know, I guess they were afraid that the guy might be there in the bushes and they were liable to get choked or something. So finally he came up a little closer. I didn't have my glasses on... I was just swaying, you know... and I had gotten one of her hands free before they came, and so I kept trying to get her to untie me, and she couldn't, she was too weak, she said.\n\"\"So finally I just kept hollering and hollering, and she said, 'Turn around and let's see if I can do it again.' She finally got it. My hands and my feet were just pure numbness... they're still numb but I'm sure that will go 'way. But I finally got... (unintelligible)... untie her so she could kind of relax out. 'Cause it was a terrible position, you know, upon our stomachs... (unintelligible)...\n\"\"And so I started to go for help. I finally got myself fairly reconciled. I wasn't too worried about dying, if that was what was going to happen, but I knew I had to keep pushing on. I had to force myself into staying alive because it was... I could just see myself... you know, all sort of waves would come over... I just (coughing sound)... (unintelligible)... 'Well, you're not gonna give up this easy', you know. And, like I say, I just kept believing that God would do everything the best, if the thing was gonna happen, but I couldn't see any reason why my dying would be the best good. So I just played along with that.\n\"\"I just started to walk toward the road... everything blacked out on me... my visual... my mind was never blacked out, but my visual was. So I lay down... My eyes started to come open... I just saw a haze of trees, you know. In a little while I got up and went another twenty feet, and then the same thing happened... (unintelligible)... and sat down. Next thing I went clear... (unintelligible)... the road, and by that time I just fell... I just... I was trying so hard to go far I just went too far. Finally I heard this pickup\nPage 7\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"coming... I was just laying alongside the road, and that's where this guy picked me up.\n\"\"They weren't in any hurry at all, it didn't seem like, you know, but they finally called an ambulance. About fifteen minutes later it came... (unintelligible)... but I still believe... I've got feeling... starting to get a little pain to come through. But from the minute that knife blade went in, it was nothing but pure shock from there on. I just did not expect it. I didn't expect that he would do that. That was a variable I had completely left out. And I guess he just took off running after we started running. I don't know. I never saw him before and hope not to see him again... at least outside of a courtroom.\n\"\"It's hard for me to explain much more. I mean I'm trying to give you a kind of example of his technique. He had some rope cut up in his back pocket. And he had a ... well, I thought it was a police automatic because it was in one of these black leather cases, you know...\n\"\"J.R. Was it in a smooth case, or did it have a basket weave like..\n\"\"B.H. Can I have my glasses? Oh, they're not here. It was a smooth one, though.\n\"\"J.R. Did he have this hood down to about the middle of his chest?\n\"\"B.H. No, about like... well, I'll show you... Here... his stomach.. You know I could see his... (voice fades away)\n\"\"J.R. Okay. You said his hair looked dark brown. How could you see his hair?\n\"\"B.H. 'Cause I saw it from where those goggles fit. I looked so closely to find out. And when he turned you know they kind of flittered... I could see his hair. It looked kind of greasy.\n\"\"J.R. Now was he as heavy as I am?\n\"\"B.H. Well I can't say 'cause he wasn't wearing those type of clothes. They were sloppy clothes, you know. And he just had on this old pair of pleated pants. I don't know... How tall are you?\n\"\"J.R. I'm about five eleven.\nPage 8\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. Well, like I say, he was dressed kind of sloppily, you know. His pants real tight up here and his stomach kind of pouched a bit, you know. I don't know... it's hard to say 'cause I can't judge you with being in a suit and all, you know, and him not being professional-looking at all. He could be about the same. It's hard to say. He was so sloppily dressed.\n\"\"J.R. Bryan, you also mentioned a drawl. Well not a drawl, an accent.\n\"\"B.H. It was just something... I guess his way of talking. It was something I couldn't repeat. It's like a song. Sometimes you know what you're going to say but you just can't sing the melody worth a darn.\n\"\"J.R. Did he have a throaty voice or a high pitched?\n\"\"B.H. In between. But it was just a unique way of talking.\n\"\"J.R. Did he sound like an educated man?\n\"\"B.H. Heck no! I don't think so.\n\"\"J.R. Did he sound illiterate?\n\"\"B.H. No. He didn't sound that way either. He just impressed me as being rather low class. The reason was because of his clothes, you know.\n\"\"J.R. Did you lose consciousness when he stabbed you at any time? Did you observe him stab Cecelia?\n\"\"B.H. Yeah...\n\"\"J.R. What did he say after...\n\"\"B.H. He stabbed her a bunch of times in the back. After she turned around, he got her once in the groin and one in the arm I think. He kind of went a little more hog-wild with her than with me. I faked dead... like that... I didn't want him to come back and give me some more.\n\"\"J.R. So you were pretty sure he thought you were dead when he finished working on you?\nPage 9\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. I think he kind of thought that. Of course I don't know because we started talking right after he left. It's hard to say... (unintelligible)... I don't think she fainted either.\n\"\"J.R. Was she in a lot of pain, did she tell you?\n\"\"B.H. Oh yeah. She was more weak at the time... (unintelligible).. from the religious angle. I told her I sure as heck wasn't going to have any deathbed conversion. 'No,' she says... (unintelligible)... I mean it was just like you were gonna die and had a few things to say. But I felt more and more I wasn't losing strength as much... (unintelligible)... that I thought I could cope with...\n\"\"J.R. What you did was a courageous thing. It was a terrible thing to have happen to anyone.\n\"\"B.H. Well there was nothing we could do. We were kind of at the mercy of him. I mean I wanted to get that gun... (unintelligible)... There was a time I think I could have gotten it...\n\"\"J.R. Did it appear to be a .45 to you? An automatic?\n\"\"B.H. It was about this long... along the stock... and had a wood edge on it, you know.. on either side...\n\"\"J.R. Handles.\n\"\"B.H. Yeah...yeah...\n\"\"J.R. Did the bullet look anything like that?\n\"\"B.H. No. It was kind of like this, only it was gold, and this part here came out along with this and then round the gold, round the blunt end. Not quite that blunt-ended, though.\n\"\"J.R. Was it fat? Fatter than this?\n\"\"B.H. Yeah, I think it was a little fatter. But it was gold, you know. And I didn't see any of this here. There was a part where it crimped... Well, almost like that 22, short, only a lot bigger. It was about like this length, maybe more stubby.\nPage 10\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n\"\"J.R. Well I'll get a .45 a little later and we can bring it up and let you observe it.\n\"\"B.H. \"\"Let's take the suspect. His hands... I don't remember if they had gloves on or not. I can't remember now. I keep thinking that he had gloves on. I can't figure how he tied us... Let's ask Celia, she probably knows about that.\n\"\"J.R. Did he swear? Did he use any profane language or obscenity?\n\"\"B.H. I don't think so. If he did it was no more than I was using at the time. I don't think he used any obscenity. He might have used a swear word or something, you know. That wasn't striking to me...\n\"\"J.R. Do you have any idea what his motive might have been? Money?\n\"\"B.H. Money. He said he was going to go to Mexico and he was flat broke.\n\"\"J.R. Did he search you after he...\n\"\"B.H. Heck no! Very unprofessional. He didn't even end up taking that loose change and didn't even take my billfold.\n\"\"J.R. Why did he stab you when you weren't fighting him off or anything?\n\"\"B.H. I couldn't. Even if I'd have wanted to. I was laying on my stomach...\n\"\"J.R. So what would have been the purpose of him to stab you, do you think?\n\"\"B.H. Well I (unintelligible)...but I think he got rattled... (unintelligible)... very, very nervous. His hands were shaking... (unintelligible)... Are you nervous?\n\"\"J.R. I'm just curious. If you could write me that symbol you were telling me about. Do you think you could draw me a picture of that even without your glasses?\n\"\"B.H. Um hum (affirmative). (Draws)... kind of like that. I can't see very well...\nPage 11\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. Yes, I see. Okay...\n\"\"B.H. ... (unintelligible)... that I could really die...\n\"\"J.R. Does this ring a bell?\n\"\"B.H. This one here. This is more like it, but I'm not sure. It was distinctly that design. It was thick. More thick marks.\n\"\"J.R. Okay. What color was this? Do you recall?\n\"\"B.H. Black. And that was white.\n\"\"J.R. This was black.\n\"\"B.H. No, that was white. It was about this tall.\n\"\"J.R. Two and a half, three inches?\n\"\"B.H. About four by four... three by three...\n\"\"J.R. How do you feel? Am I tiring you out too much?\n\"\"B.H. No. I've had a couple shots. It's not hurting me at all.\n\"\"J.R. Do you think Cecelia could tell me any more than you have already told me? Add anything?\n\"\"B.H. (unintelligible)\n\"\"J.R. Did he slap you around? Slap her?\n\"\"B.H. (unintelligible)... No.\n\"\"J.R. He was a much smaller man than you?\n\"\"B.H. Not much. About your height I guess. I don't know.\n\"\"J.R. Well you're getting kind of sleepy. I'll ease up on you.\n\"\"B.H. Have you gotten any clues at all?\n\"\"J.R. Yes, we've got some good clues. Before we get this guy it's going to take a lot of work.\n\"\"B.H. Remember he said he was headed for Mexico,\nPage 12\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. He's headed for Mexico?\n\"\"B.H. That's what he said.\n\"\"J.R. I'll leave you my card. It's right up here. I'm going to go down and talk to your mom and dad.\n\"\"B.H. Have the news heard about this at all?\n\"\"J.R. Yes.\n\"\"B.H. Was there anything in the paper today?\n\"\"J.R. No, it wasn't in...\n\"\"B.H. The Napa paper?\n\"\"J.R. Well there's no Napa paper on Sundays. It's been on the news media...\n\"\"B.H. Names? Did they name my name?\n\"\"J.R. I don't know, to tell you the truth.\n\"\"B.H. The reason I asked is my girl friend lives in Portland and I've got to talk to her before it gets to her...\n\"\"J.R. Okay\n\"\"B.H. What time is it now?\n\"\"J.R. It's one o'clock\n\"\"B.H. What are the rates now?\n\"\"J.R. Don't you worry about the rates.\n\"\"B.H. Well I should probably give her a call...\n\"\"J.R. You're looking real good. You've got some color...\n\"\"B.H. Is there a phone real close by?\n\"\"J.R. I'll get the nurse...\n\"\"B.H. 'Cause I'd like to call her now...\nPage 13\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R.

CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his son would like to talk to them at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop regarding a possible suspect in this crime. \nAt 0912 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan contacted DR. R. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his 16-yr. old son DAVID LEE RAYFIELD at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop. DR. RAYFIELD gave a home address of Los Gatos, California. DR. RAYFIELD stated that about 6:30 P.M. the previous evening he and his son had parked their car north of Park Headquarters in the general area of the crime scene. \nThey stated they went down towards the beach area when DAVID RAYFIELD noticed a white male adult subject walking in the area, described as about 5'10\"\", heavy build, wearing dark trousers, a dark shirt with red in it, long sleeves. He stated this subject was carrying nothing in his hands and was apparently just walking alongside the hill area about halfway between the road and the lake. DAVID further stated that when the subject observed him he turned around and walked up the hill in a southerly direction. DR. RAYFIELD and his son stated that they did not notice a vehicle in the area of their vehicle and only this subject at a distance of about 100 yards. \nThey also advised there was a man with two young boys in the area shooting B-B guns, but they did not know if this man saw the subject or not. This location was approximately 8/10ths of a mile from the scene of the victim's vehicle. In the opinion of R/Os, it is unlikely, unless this male subject had a vehicle in the immediate area, he could have traversed the area to the scene of the crime on foot. There are four coves of water between the scene of the crime and the area where the doctor saw the subject. The interview with DR. RAYFIELD and his son was terminated at that point.\n\",,\"recGZwp9mtC6qB9Hd,recIgEVcAF0n18DST,reccRBkzVCjHazVUW\",,,recJ0x1q0mKJ3HoOg,reczLS0i9zVkwmRCs,recguCeqiWgWqR24q,1969,September,Saturday,recmQK2TtG43z2t8t,Case Event,1969-09-27T18:30:00.000Z,9/27/1969 6:30PM,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Rayfields%20see%20a%20suspicious%20man%20at%20Lake%20Berryessa&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Rayfields%20see%20a%20suspicious%20man%20at%20Lake%20Berryessa&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2025-09-27T18:15:32.000Z,6:30 PM,,1969-09-27T18:30:00.000Z,,\"Title: NCSD Report on Lake Berryessa\n\nDate: 1969-10-05T00:00:00.000Z\n\nAuthor / Source: Napa County Sheriff's Department, Ken Narlow, Richard Lonergan, David Lee Rayfield, R.

BYRD advised that MISS JUDY was a student at the college and had left the college earlier in the afternoon, driving a yellow Datsun. At 2135 hours Reporting Officers put out an All Points Bulletin around the City and County of Napa for this above described vehicle. At 2137 hours Officers received permission to interview the victim BRYAN HARTNELL who was taken to the X-Ray Room for x-rays. Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Lonergan attempted to interview BRYAN HARTNELL while in the presence of DONALD JUDAH and hospital attendant CLIFFORD MEAGHER. Sgt. Narlow was called away to answer a phone before the interview got under way. HARTNELL appeared to be in extreme pain and also appeared to be in shock. Reporting Officer Lonergan introduced himself to HARTNELL and asked him to give us any information he had on his assailant. HARTNELL stated that the assailant was wearing a black ceremonial type hood, square on top, and appeared to be heavy-set, between 200 and 250 pounds. He also stated his assailant had approached both him and MISS SHEPARD with a gun but had stabbed them with a long knife. HARTNELL further stated the gun was in a black holster and the knife was in a sheath. He stated that the attacker was wearing dark clothing, dark jacket and dark pants. HARTNELL further stated that the gun was an automatic pistol and the knife had a black handle and appeared to be homemade.\nIt should be noted that HARTNELL was very groggy and he was very difficult to interview at that time. Subject was re-interviewed the next day by Det/Sgt. Robertson and gave more complete details. (The report of Sgt. Robertson's interview is attached.)\nAt 2215 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan left the Queen of the Valley Hospital after advising Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and William Munk to take charge of the clothing of the victims and any other evidence from the victims when it was released from the hospital. Munk and Brambrink were also advised to stand by at the hospital as a security measure until other arrangements could be made.\nAs Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan were arriving at the Napa County Sheriff's Office, they were advised by the Napa Police Department that they had located MISS JUDY in the downtown Napa area and were bringing her to the Napa County Sheriff's Office. MISS [JUDY] was interviewed by Lonergan and Narlow at the Napa County Sheriff's Office. She was further identified as MISS JUDITH, a student at Pacific Union College, with a permanent residence address of Sun Valley, California. MISS [JUDITH] advised that she was with BRYAN\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

She stated that they all left Pacific Union College together at approximately 1:00 P.M. and went to a rummage sale in the City of St. Helena. She stated that BRYAN had bought a T.V. set at the rummage sale and had to transport it back to his room at Pacific Union College. She stated he left CECELIA at the rummage sale as there was not enough room in his car. MISS [JUDITH] stated BRYAN returned to the St. Helena area and picked up CECELIA at approximately 2:00 P.M. MISS [JUDITH] stated as far as she knew, both BRYAN and CECELIA were planning to go to San Francisco when they left her in St. Helena. MISS [JUDITH] stated she had no knowledge of any plans that BRYAN and CECELIA were making to go to the Lake Berryessa area. MISS [JUDITH] stated the last time she saw BRYAN and CECELIA was approximately 2:00 P.M. in the afternoon.\nThe interview with MISS [JUDITH] was terminated at that point.\nDet/Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow then proceeded to Lake Berryessa and arrived at the scene of the crime, which was approximately a mile and a half north of Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters, at 2354 hours. The scene was being preserved by uniformed officers and under the direct control of Deputy Sheriffs David Collins and Ray Land. The investigating officers were briefed by Officers Collins and Land as to what had taken place prior to our arrival. Officers observed a 1956 white Kharman Ghia with a black vinyl top, Oregon license plate 4 U 2040. Investigating officers were shown footprints in dirt area and tire tracks, both believed to have been left by responsible. Investigating officers awaited the arrival of Sgt. Tom Butler who had been called to take photographs of the crime scene area and Sgt. Hal Snook, criminalist for collection and preservation of physical evidence. R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were advised by Park Ranger Dennis Land who had also arrived at the scene that it was possible to get to the beach area by vehicle from a locked gate approximately one-half mile south of the victim's vehicle. Officers proceeded to the area and arrived at the footpath approximately halfway between the scene of the crime at the beach and the victim's vehicle on the road. At that point, after a brief examination of the footpath area, officers discovered a similar footprint on the footpath to that found at the scene of the victim's vehicle. At that point, due to the lateness and darkness of the hour, Reporting Officers decided to completely secure the area and make a thorough search of the scene at first light. Officers then exited the crime scene area in the same manner and locked the aforementioned gate leading to this vicinity. Investigating officers along with Park Ranger Dennis Land went to the Berryessa Park Headquarters.\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

These items consisted of a blanket, a pair of man's shoes, a wallet belonging to BRYAN HARTNELL, eyeglasses, and playing cards. Among the various aforementioned items believed to belong to the victims, were numerous strands of white plastic line cut into various assorted lengths, some of which had what appeared to be bloodstains. These items were subsequently turned over to Det/Sgt. Hal Snook for preservation.\nAssigned investigators then proceeded back to the scene where the victim's car was parked and assisted Sgt. Snook in the making of the plaster casts. At approximately 0245 hours Sgt. Lonergan, having previously obtained the keys to the vehicle from BRYAN HARTNELL's property at Queen of the Valley Hospital, drove the white Kharman Ghia to the maintenance shop at Berryessa Park Headquarters. The vehicle was parked inside of the maintenance shop building and the building was secured for the evening by investigating officers with the assistance of Park Ranger Dennis Land. Assigned Investigators then returned back to the scene where the victim's vehicle had been previously parked and awaited the arrival of Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and Mel Fechter who were assigned to security duty in the crime scene area. At approximately 0300 hours officers assumed their duties at the crime scene area and the security was placed under the direction of Deputy Allen Brambrink. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then returned to their respective residences with plans to continue the investigation at daybreak.\n9/28/69 0700 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene at Lake Berryessa area, accompanied by Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Capt. Donald Townsend, and Sgt. James Munk. Officers then assisted Det/Sgt. Snook in tracking the footprints from the vehicle to the scene of the crime by the beach area. (The location and preservation of aforementioned footprints will be detailed in a supplementary evidence report by Sgt. Snook.)\nAt 0800 hours Reporting Officers Lonergan and Narlow received information via Park Headquarters that a DR. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his son would like to talk to them at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop regarding a possible suspect in this crime. At 0912 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan contacted DR. R. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his 16-yr. old son DAVID LEE RAYFIELD at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop. DR. RAYFIELD gave a home address of Los Gatos, California. DR. RAYFIELD stated that about 6:30 P.M. the previous evening he and his son had parked their car north of Park Headquarters in the general area of the\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts.

They stated they went down towards the beach area when DAVID RAYFIELD noticed a white male adult subject walking in the area, described as about 5'10\"\", heavy build, wearing dark trousers, a dark shirt with red in it, long sleeves. He stated this subject was carrying nothing in his hands and was apparently just walking alongside the hill area about halfway between the road and the lake. DAVID further stated that when the subject observed him he turned around and walked up the hill in a southerly direction. DR. RAYFIELD and his son stated that they did not notice a vehicle in the area of their vehicle and only this subject at a distance of about 100 yards. They also advised there was a man with two young boys in the area shooting B-B guns, but they did not know if this man saw the subject or not. This location was approximately 8/10ths of a mile from the scene of the victim's vehicle. In the opinion of R/Os, it is unlikely, unless this male subject had a vehicle in the immediate area, he could have traversed the area to the scene of the crime on foot. There are four coves of water between the scene of the crime and the area where the doctor saw the subject. The interview with DR. RAYFIELD and his son was terminated at that point.\nAt 1000 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene of the crime and further assisted Sgt. Snook in the collecting and locating of evidence.\nAt 1320 hours 9/28/69, R/Os interviewed Ranger Sgt. William White at Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters. White was interviewed as to his activities before and during his part in locating the victims the night before. White stated at approximately 1855 hours 9/27/69 he was on routine patrol around the Lake Berryessa area when he received a call from Park Headquarters to proceed to the Rancho Monticello Resort where a person was reporting a possible stabbing. \nWhite stated he proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort where he was contacted by ARCHIE E. WHITE, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG. RONALD FONG advised him that he had seen a male and a female victim on the beach area south of Rancho Monticello Resort, hollering that they had been stabbed. Ranger Sgt. White, accompanied by ARCHIE WHITE, ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the beach area via speedboat owned by ARCHIE WHITE. When they arrived on the beach they observed a young female lying on the ground with what appeared to be numerous stab wounds. Ranger Sgt. White stated that the female appeared to be in a great deal of pain. White stated as they discovered the female victim, Ranger Dennis Land arrived at the scene in his pickup truck, carrying a male victim who also appeared to have numerous stab wounds. White stated he immediately radioed in and had Park Headquarters call the Sheriff's Office to dispatch an ambulance and a Deputy. White stated he attempted to interview both the boy and girl victims while awaiting\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

According to White, the male victim said that a male subject approached them, wearing a hood, dressed in dark clothing. The subject was carrying what appeared to be an automatic pistol and stated that he wanted their money and car keys. According to White, the male victim related to him that the subject advised him he was an ex-con out of Colorado and was en route to Mexico. Suspect stated he had to tie them up, and after they were tied the responsible stated, \"\"I'm going to have to stab you.\"\" White further related that the male victim advised the responsible, \"\"Stab me first, I can't stand to see her stabbed first.\"\" The male victim then advised that the responsible stabbed him numerous times in the back and then stabbed the girl.\nThe female victim advised White that she could not see the responsible's face as a hood was covering all of his head. She also advised White that the suspect had what appeared to be clip-on sunglasses to cover his eyes. Ranger Sgt. White stated that this is the most he could get out of either victim as they were both in great shock and pain. White stated that he noticed a lot of blood near the girl's groin area. The interview with Ranger Sgt. White was terminated at that point.\n9/28/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort and interviewed MR. ARCHIE E. WHITE. (It should be noted that ARCHIE E. WHITE and ELIZABETH WHITE are no relation to Ranger Sgt. White.) ARCHIE E. WHITE is the owner of the Boat Repair Shop at Rancho Monticello Resort. He lives at the Resort. Also interviewed were MR. WHITE's wife, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE. MR. and MRS. WHITE advised that they were contacted by RONALD FONG who advised them he had just observed what appeared to be a male and a female subject lying on the beach south of the Rancho Monticello Resort, covered with blood. FONG advised them that the couple had shouted out to him that they had been stabbed and robbed. MRS. WHITE immediately called Park Headquarters and Ranger Sgt. William White arrived at the Resort a short time later. MR. and MRS. WHITE, accompanied by Ranger Sgt. Bill White and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the scene area in one of MR. WHITE's ski boats. When they arrived on the scene, they observed a young female wearing a sweater dress lying on the beach, covered with blood. When they approached the area she was on her elbows and knees, rocking back and forth as if in great pain. MRS. WHITE stated she immediately attempted to make the victim more comfortable and tried to calm her down until the ambulance arrived. MRS. WHITE stated the girl advised him, \"\"He was a man with a hood... His face was covered... He was wearing black pants... It hurts, it\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts.

WHITE then advised after the female had regained her composure, she told her the man had asked for money but didn't take any. She said she hadn't been raped. MRS. WHITE further advised that the female victim told her that the responsible was wearing glasses, with dark clip-on sunglasses over the hood. She told her that the responsible had a black pistol. MR. ARCHIE WHITE stated he overheard the male victim advise someone that the responsible was wearing gloves. MR. and MRS. WHITE further advised that this is the only information either victim gave them on the responsible, and that they spent the balance of the time attempting to make the victim more comfortable until the arrival of the ambulance.\nAfter the interview with MR. and MRS. WHITE, Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan returned to the Napa County Sheriff's Office.\nAt 1620 hours R/O Det/Sgt. Narlow was contacted by a DEAN of the Pacific Union College in Angwin. DEAN advised that three young ladies, students at the college, might possibly have information as to a suspect in the attack at Lake Berryessa. The young ladies were identified as MISS JOANNE, MISS LINDA, and MISS LINDA. DEAN advised that these girls had been in the Lake Berryessa area from about 3:00 P.M. to 4:30 P.M. the previous Saturday afternoon. They had observed a male subject in a late model, silver blue Chevrolet, two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. DEAN advised that the girls had told him they were observed out of the car by this subject while they were sunbathing on the beach. They described the subject as approximately 40 years old, [blank] feet tall, dressed in dark clothing. Sgt. Narlow dispatched Deputy Sheriff Raymond Land to interview these three girls that evening. (The report of Land's interview is attached.)\nReporting Officers spent the balance of the day and evening going through their investigative notes and issuing a statewide All Points Bulletin.\nMonday, 9/29/69 Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan spent the majority of the morning interviewing numerous citizens and officers from other departments regarding this crime and similar crimes. (A general list of possible suspects was begun and they are noted on separate incident reports as to origin of information and description of suspects, attached.)\nReporting Officers were advised by Deputy Sheriff Ray Land who interviewed the three college girls, MISS [JOANNE], MISS [LINDA], and MISS [LINDA] that the information appeared to have some merit and advised that the three young ladies would be in the office in the afternoon for further interview.\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgt.

Lonergan, Sgt. Snook, and Capt. Donald Townsend.\nLonergan interviewed a MISS JOANNE MARIE, who, [age] years of age, DOB [blank], her address at the college is 114 Dauphine, Pacific Union College, home address South East 12th, College Place, Washington. MISS [JOANNE] advised R/O that on 9/27/69 at approximately 5:30 P.M. she and her two girlfriends parked their vehicle at a location two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. When they left their car they noticed a subject driving a late model silver blue Chevrolet, 2-door sedan, pull up behind them. What appeared to be a white male adult was sitting in the vehicle. They did not observe this subject leave the vehicle. The girls proceeded to the beach area and were sunbathing in their bikinis. After approximately one-half hour had passed, they observed what appeared to be the same subject standing within 40 or 50 feet of them, apparently observing them. This subject was described as 6' tall, weighing 200/210 lbs., muscular build, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing dark pants and a dark pullover shirt. The subject would stare at the three girls but when they looked up at him he would look away. The subject hung around the area for approximately 45 minutes and then the girls observed him walk up the hill. MISS [JOANNE] stated it was very doubtful that from his vantage point in the vehicle the subject could observe the three girls on the beach. She believes he waited in his vehicle and then followed them down after they were on the beach. MISS [JOANNE] further described the car as appearing very conservative. She stated the car did not appear to belong to any young person such as a teenager. She did state the car had California license plates but did not notice the number.\nThe other two young ladies, MISS [LINDA] and MISS [LINDA] were interviewed by Sgt. Snook and Capt. Donald Townsend.\nMISS LINDA who was interviewed by R/O Det/Sgt. Snook, is a WFA, DOB [blank], home address Sunnyside Road, Sanitarium.

The girls drove through Pope Valley to Lake Berryessa where they parked their vehicle two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand. MISS [LINDA] stated she observed a subject go into the parking lot area to the south. Subject went past their vehicle and backed up so their rear bumpers were nearly touching. Vehicle described as a 1966 or 1967 light blue Chevrolet with California plates. Witness believes the vehicle was a 2-door sedan and described the headlights as being long rather than round. The rear window glass was tinted quite dark. Another vehicle from Angwin with Arizona plates was in the parking area and witness saw the occupants, a MISS DENISE BROWN and a MR. WAYNE HAIGHT.

After about 30 minutes the subject came down by the beach and passed within 20 feet of witness as he walked from south to north. Subject was described by MISS [LINDA] as approximately 28 years of age, 6' to 6'2\"\" tall, 200/225 lbs., black hair possibly styled, with a part on left, rounded eyes, thin lips, medium nose, straight eyebrows, small ears, well built, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing a black short-sleeved sweater shirt, bunched up in front, and a white tee shirt hanging out in back, and dark trousers. The three girls left the area about 4:30 P.M. and the subject's vehicle was gone. Witnesses did not observe the subject either leave or get back into his vehicle.\nMISS LINDA LEE was interviewed by R/O Capt. Donald Townsend. MISS [LINDA LEE] is a WFA, DOB [blank], address Howell Mountain Road, Angwin. MISS [LINDA LEE] is employed as a secretary of the college press. MISS [LINDA LEE] observed the same vehicle which was described as a late model Chevrolet, sky blue in color. The rear tail lights appeared to be long rather than round. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated they parked their vehicle at approximately 2:55 P.M. and observed the subject in his vehicle at that location. The girls proceeded to the beach and she, MISS [LINDA LEE], again noticed the subject about 30 to 45 minutes after they were at the beach. She noticed him standing on the bank approximately 45 yards from her location. She described the subject as 6 feet tall, stocky build, about 200 lbs., black short-sleeved sweater shirt, dark blue slacks, and straight dark hair neatly combed. She guessed his age at approximately 30 years. Subject had medium color skin and was not wearing glasses. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated she thought she saw a white belt around his back but it possibly was a tee shirt hanging out. She further stated that the man was fairly nice-looking, with a round face. She did not observe the subject leave the area in his vehicle.\n9/29/69 - 1600 hours Reporting Officers Sgt. Narlow and Sgt. Lonergan were advised by Capt.

He described these boots as being Government issue, issued to all Air Force personnel at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. They are primarily designed as a wing-walker shoe, however according to MR. [BASSEL] most Air Force personnel and many of the civilian personnel employed at Air Force bases had this type of shoe. The sole design of this shoe exactly matched the plaster cast design that Sgt. Snook had taken at the scene of the crime. It should be noted that Det/Sgt John Robertson had attempted to find a similar shoe design at the local shoe stores in the Napa area with negative results. (Refer Sgt. Robertson's supplementary report.) MR. [BASSEL] was asked if we could keep his shoes for identification purposes and he agreed. R/Os was also advised that this information regarding the type of footprint had not been released to the press or general public. MR.

She stated at this time they were parked on the Knoxville Road approximately one mile south of the Lake Berryessa Marina. She stated shortly after they parked the vehicle they observed the victims who were known to them, BRYAN HARTNELL and CECELIA SHEPARD, driving south on Knoxville Road in BRYAN's white Kharman Ghia. She stated as the HARTNELL vehicle drove by, BRYAN waved out the window and said, \"\"Hi, John!\"\", referring to MR. [JOHN]. MISS [MARILYN] stated that they did not see the HARTNELL vehicle any other time that day.\n9/30/69, 0900 hours R/Os Det/Sgt. Narlow and Det/Sgt. Richard Lonergan, accompanied by Sgt. Thomas Butler, proceeded to the Morrison Funeral Home in St. Helena. They were met at the funeral home by Capt. Joseph Page and the owner of the Funeral Home, Mr. Harold.

Kenneth Narlow contacted CAPT. at Travis Air Force Base and arranged for an interview with COL. and SGT. to take place on Wednesday morning, October 1st, 1969, at 9:00 A.M. R/Os wanted to talk to someone at Travis regarding the shoeprints that were found on the scene. The remainder of the day and evening was spent in answering phone calls from people who had possible knowledge of the crime.\nWednesday, 10/1/69 - 0900 hours Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow went to Travis Air Force Base and were present at an interview in Col. office, who is Commanding Officer in charge of base security. Also present at this meeting besides the aforementioned officers was LT. COL. of the Office of Special Investigation. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan advised the Air Force personnel present of the portion of the evidence we had discovered at the crime scene and asked them for assistance in locating where this type of shoe was sold or issued. LT. COL. advised that his office would assist assigned investigators in attempting to locate the source of the shoe.\nOfficers were directed to the Base Supply with the assistance of Special Agent DONALD of O.S.I., at which time it was determined through Base Supply that this shoe in question was of Government issue and that it was not kept in stock at Base Supply, however it was believed that the Sales Store had such an item. It was then explained that if a military person or civilian employee was determined to be in need of such an item, he first reported to the Base Supply, at which time he was issued a purchase requisition which he in turn took to the Sales Store and the type of shoe was issued to the individual and they in turn required the individual to sign the purchase requisition showing that he did receive the item. This purchase requisition states the type of shoe that the individual was to receive, however makes no reference as to size.\nAssigned investigators, accompanied by Special Agent proceeded to the Sales Store located on Travis Air Force Base. After a short period of time R/Os located in stock a shoe fitting the identical description of the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast which officers had in their possession. The identical shoe with identical tread was found and a shoe bearing the closest measurements in the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast was measured and found to be a size 10 1/2 in military styling or a 10 1/2 D in civilian equivalent. It was determined through Air Force records that they were unable to furnish officers with the\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

Air Force records indicate this type shoe is manufactured by the International Shoe Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, then shipped to Air Force Depot, Ogden, Utah, and from there shipped to the various military installations upon requisition orders.\n10/1/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then proceeded to the Vallejo Police Department and met with Sgt. Jack Mullanax and Sgt. Duane Nilsson. Officers exchanged information regarding Vallejo's crime of 7/4/69 and our particular incident. Suspect information was exchanged and is listed in the separate suspect file.\nInvestigating Officers checked to determine the validity of the decoded message and as to how far the original cyphers had been decoded. It was then learned that the message had been decoded by at least two different sources, one being by MR. and MRS. HARDIN of Salinas and the other by the FBI in Washington. It was noted that these cyphers were broken independent of one another and the FBI confirmed the validity of the original decoded message. It was also learned that there was a small portion on the very end of the coded message that had not been decoded for reasons unknown.\nThe balance of the afternoon and evening Reporting Officers and other investigating officers met to exchange information and further discuss the evidence at hand.\nThursday, October 2nd, 1969, 0845 hours Reporting Officer Lonergan received a telephone call from Special Agent, OSI, Travis Air Force Base. Subject called to report that approximately 500 to 1,000 of that type of wing-walker shoe have been sold as surplus on the Base. This would be over and above those sold at the Sales Store. Agent further related he has the names of all the subjects who have purchased this item through surplus and will keep these names available to officers upon request.\nThe balance of the morning was spent searching fingerprint evidence and answering phone calls from possible witnesses.\nThursday, 10/2/69, 1400 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan attended the funeral services for victim CECELIA SHEPARD. These services were held at the Pacific Union College Church, Angwin, California. Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan positioned themselves\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow\n- TYPED BY: M.

Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Sgt. Thomas Butler, and Detective Ronald Montgomery of the Napa Police Department positioned themselves outside the church and photographed all persons entering and leaving the services. This included individual photographs and group scenes. Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow also attended the graveside services at the St. Helena Cemetery in St. Helena.\nFriday, 10/3/69 - Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Richard Lonergan contacted JAMES, Napa State Hospital, advised him to set up an interview with a patient who is a possible suspect in our case. The patient is identified as GRIFFIN RAYMOND FRANKLIN, WMA, 20 yrs. of age, DOB [blank], 6'2\"\", 223 lbs. [JAMES] had previously reported that this subject had left the hospital on a pass Friday evening, 9/26/69, and returned to the hospital Monday afternoon, 9/29/69. This subject also had spent time in the Air Force and was discharged from the Air Force in January 1969 for psychiatric problems. According to the doctors at the hospital, this subject was capable of committing this type of a crime. R/O in the presence of JAMES and Security Officer PHIL RYAN interviewed subject FRANKLIN. FRANKLIN was very cooperative and talkative to R/O and went over his activities the prior weekend. Briefly stated, MR. FRANKLIN, whose parents live in Vallejo, never left the Vallejo area that weekend and stayed around home talking with his mother, stepfather, and three brothers. After interviewing subject, it was the opinion of R/O Sgt. Lonergan that this subject was not the responsible. He had a definite very fast manner of speaking which was completely opposed to the victim's statement concerning the suspect's voice. R/O also contacted the mother of the suspect, a MRS. OPAL at Hollywood Avenue, Vallejo. MRS. OPAL stated more or less the exact same thing that her son had stated as to his whereabouts that weekend. It appears that this subject has a reliable alibi as to his activities and had no access to a vehicle that weekend. This subject was cleared as far as this crime is concerned.\nThe balance of the morning and afternoon was spent by R/Os Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan going over physical evidence and dictating reports.\nInvestigation continuing.\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow\n- TYPED BY: M.

Reporting Officer John Robertson, Det/Sgt., interviewed one of two victims who were each stabbed numerous times by an unknown assailant. Victim CECELIA SHEPARD and victim BRYAN HARTNELL both had been placed in the Queen of the Valley Hospital intensive care unit. Victim SHEPARD had surgery performed on her earlier in the morning (9/28/69) and was unable to be questioned by the Reporting Officer, however Dr. Ludwig gave permission for victim HARTNELL to be interviewed.\nAlthough victim HARTNELL was heavily sedated, he was able to give R/O a verbal statement. (Note: R/O taped electrically the interview with victim HARTNELL.) Victim HARTNELL related the following.\nHe had known CECELIA SHEPARD for some time, they were good friends, and she had come to the Napa County area to spend the weekend. She and a female companion, DALORA LEE, Aspen, Loma Linda, San Bernardino County, Calif. (phone Ext. 2155) had driven from Southern California and were to drive back Sunday, 9/28/69. Victim stated he and MISS SHEPARD drove to Lake Berryessa, picked a large tree near the shore line where they decided to lie down and enjoy the scenery. While lying on the ground, victim HARTNELL stated he heard a noise and asked MISS SHEPARD if she could hear anything or see anything behind a tree not far from where the couple were lying. MISS SHEPARD told victim HARTNELL she could see a man behind the tree. HARTNELL asked her what he was doing. MISS SHEPARD stated she couldn't tell. HARTNELL stated he (suspect) then came from behind the tree. MISS SHEPARD said, \"\"Oh my God, he has a gun!\"\"\nVictim HARTNELL stated the man approached the couple, aiming a black steel automatic pistol. The suspect stated he needed a car and money. Suspect stated his car was \"\"hot\"\" and he wanted victim HARTNELL's car keys. Victim HARTNELL stated he began talking with the suspect, telling the suspect he had no money, only a small amount of change, also that if the suspect was really in need of assistance HARTNELL would attempt to help him. The suspect told victim to get on the ground. Suspect then had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him. HARTNELL stated he attempted to keep the suspect engaged in conversation while suspect was tying the victims.\nHARTNELL further stated the suspect was described as follows: Wearing a black hooded mask (cloth), covering suspect's entire head and shoulders, coming down almost to suspect's waist. Victim stated on front of the four-cornered type mask (similar to paper bag in style) there was a symbol, the symbol described as white, approximately 3 x 3 inches in diameter, with a symmetrical cross. Also on the eyelets of the mask was a pair of clip-on sunglasses, the glasses clipped to the eyelets. Victim stated he could also see hair through the mask's eyelets and observed the hair to be dark brown.\nVictim stated suspect was wearing a light-weight windbreaker, dark blue or black, pleated slacks (old-fashioned type). Victim could not remember what type of shoes or anything about suspect's hands, could not remember if suspect was wearing gloves.\nVictim thought suspect was possibly 20 to 30 years of age by voice concept. Victim stated suspect was 5'8\"\" to 6', 225-250 lbs., dark brown hair, eyes unknown, sloppy dresser, stomach hanging over trousers. Suspect spoke with some\nPage 17\n(2)\ntype of drawl, but victim stated it was not a Southern drawl, did not really know what type of drawl, but thought the man was not well educated, but did not feel he was illiterate either. Victim said suspect's voice was moderate in sound, that is, not high or low pitched.\nSuspect told victim he was sent to (?) Lodge State Prison (possibly Deer Lodge State Prison), Montana, for a killing. While there (in prison) he killed a guard while escaping. Suspect also told victims he was heading for Mexico, told victim he was flat broke.\nVictim observed cut-up rope in suspect's rear pocket (trouser's), also stated he was wearing a knife in a case (on belt) on his right side, near front of trousers. Knife description: Appeared to be a long bread knife, 12\"\" long blade, 3/4\"\" wide, hardwood handle, 2 brass rivets holding handle in place, cotton surgical tape wrapped approximately 1\"\" around handle of knife. Knife case possibly made of wood.\nVictim asked suspect if suspect's gun was loaded. Suspect removed magazine from handle of pistol and showed victim a bullet removed from gun, bullet described as a possible .45 caliber. Victim did not know what caliber the pistol was.\nSuspect had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him, suspect then tied victim SHEPARD's hands, then re-tied HARTNELL's hands, then tied both victims' ankles together, had victims lie on their stomachs. HARTNELL stated suspect said, \"\"I'm getting nervous.\"\" This was when suspect was tying MISS SHEPARD'S hands, in fact HARTNELL stated suspect got real shaky when he was tying MISS SHEPARD's hands.\nVictim HARTNELL then stated that without warning the suspect plunged his knife into the back of HARTNELL. Suspect did this repeatedly, HARTNELL stated he thinks six times. HARTNELL stated he pretended to be dead and the suspect went over to MISS SHEPARD and stabbed MISS SHEPARD repeatedly in the back, and when MISS SHEPARD turned her body over (on back), suspect stabbed her in the lower abdomen. Victim stated suspect stabbed MISS SHEPARD much worse than him. Suspect went into some sort of frenzy when stabbing MISS SHEPARD.\nVictim HARTNELL stated suspect left the area after the stabbing. Victim HARTNELL hailed a boat (off shore) and told the man in the boat the couple needed help badly. Victim stated the boat left the area and he (victim) attempted to get help by crawling and walking to the road. (Victim believed he had walked to the road, however had not gone too far from his wounded companion.)\nVictim stated he thought suspect had been with the couple for approximately fifteen (15) minutes from time of observing suspect until suspect departed. Victim stated suspect did not take his wallet, although when MISS SHEPARD was tying victim HARTNELL's hands, she reached in his pocket and threw his wallet to suspect. Suspect did not take the wallet or victim's car keys.\nVictim stated a man in a pickup truck found him on the road and called an ambulance. Victim stated he estimated one hour in time was involved between the time he and MISS SHEPARD were stabbed until help arrived.\nMISS SHEPARD is listed in critical condition.\n\n-------\n\nTranscript\nPage 1\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-321-F9-5861\nSgt. ROBERTSON stated that Mr. HARTNELL was heavily sedated but was able to give a verbal statement pertaining to the attack at Lake Berrysessa. The interview was taped and reads as follows:\n\"\"INTERVIEW OF JOHN ROBERTSON, DET/SGT., NAPA COUNTY SHERIFF's DEPARTMENT, WITH BRYAN CALVIN HARTNELL (NSO CASE #105907) AT QUEEN OF THE VALLEY HOSPITAL ON SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1969 (TRANSCRIBED FROM TAPE RECORDING BY M. FEURLE):\n\"\"J.R. Can you give me this fellow's description and tell me what happened?\n\"\"B.H. So many people have been asking me... I hope...\n\"\"J.R. Well sometimes when we're repetitious, I know it happens to me, I tell the same thing over and over and over, and sometimes I might vary a little, and if you do...\n\"\"B.H. Shall I just start out and tell you what happened?\n\"\"J.R. I don't want to tire you out.\n\"\"B.H. I just don't want this to happen again to anybody... Of course he might have his reasons, I don't know...\n\"\"J.R. Okay. Go right ahead. Start right from the beginning. What happened?\n\"\"B.H. Okay. This girl came out from school, I used to go with her two years ago, and she's now going to another school, and she came up to visit some friends and we were having dinner at the school cafeteria, and I said, 'Well, are you doing anything special this afternoon?' and she said, 'Why?', and I said, 'I don't know. We could go out and either go for a walk, go to San Francisco, or, you know, just...', 'cause we used to be good friends. We used to have a good friendship. And so it got too late by the time we got around to what we were going to do. We had to stop in St. Helena for a couple items and then we had to cart a couple kids home and stuff, and by the time we finally got around to it, it was getting late, and I thought going to San Francisco 'd rush you, you know, because by the time we got back for worship... And so we went out to Berryessa, and there was this one place I used to go out... we used to all the time, you know... and I couldn't find it. And so I figured Ah, forget it, and this looks like as good a place as any. So I parked the car, there were no other cars there. I had a Kharman Ghia, '56, white, with a black vinyl top, and it's in pretty\nPage 2\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n... \"\"good-looking shape. But we parked there on the road's edge and we talked Oh it must be about a quarter of a mile to down to the place where we went. We had... (unintelligible) peninsula, it's an an island I guess during the wetter season, You can see where it was levee... And so that looked like a lot... there was a big spreading tree up there. There were two of them, really, one was a little bigger than the other. We took the one that was out on the point.\n\"\"It was really beautiful out there. We were sitting on top... I lay down on my back and she lay down on her stomach beside me, you know, kind of resting her head on my shoulder, and we were talking, you know, kind of reminiscing about old times, and stuff. And I heard these rustling leaves, and I said, 'You have your specs on. Why don't you see what the deal is over there?' And she says, 'Oh, it's some man.' And I said, 'Is he alone?' and she said, 'Yeah... (unintelligible)...' and she says, 'Well he just stepped behind the tree.' And I said, 'What's the idea of that? To take a leak?' You know, 'cause that's the only thing I could think of, just step behind a tree. And so I says, 'Well, keep looking and tell me what happens,' and she says, 'Oh my God, he's got a gun!' and squeezed my arm and\n\"\"And so he came out, and of course still actually I wasn't... There's some things you really wouldn't mind having happen, just for the experience of it. You know I thought, Well I only got fifty cents on me. It's worth all of that having it happen. I didn't think about another angle. So I talked to him, you know. I said, 'Well listen, Mac, (you know I'm in the sociologist field, you know, I'm pre-law, with history and psych.) You know I've read about the criminal mind and everything, you know. I thought well maybe the guy really does need help, you know. I says, 'There's no strings attached.' I says, 'I don't have any money right now but if you need help that badly I can help you out in another way maybe.' And he says, 'Nah.. time's running short,' he says, ''cause I just got out of... some prison in Montana, I don't know what the name of it is. Feathers? Do you know what the name of it is? I'll see if it sounds familiar. Fern or Feathers? It's some double name, like Fern Lock or something...\n\"\"J.R. It's Lodge..\nPage 3\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. Oh yeah, yeah, Lodge. At least we know we're together on that.\n\"\"J.R. Mountain Lodge Prison, or something of that nature...\n\"\"B.H. Yeah. You know he said he broke out and had to kill a guard getting out. And I said, 'Well, man, I mean actually I don't mean to call your bluff or anything, but wouldn't you rather be stuck on a stealing charge than a threat of homicide?' you know? And he says, 'Well just don't start playing hero on me.' You know, 'Don't try to grab the gun,' 'cause I didn't really figure the gun was loaded. I always thought it would be empty. I've heard a lot of times that this is what they do just as a bluff, but I decided not to call his bluff after he really, you know... I told him, 'You know you're really wasting your time with me. I've got a billfold and this much change and that's it.' And he said, he told the girl, 'Go tie him up. I'd feel much better if you were tied up.' And she tied a couple of loose knots on me, so I made it look kind of tight... (unintelligible)... you know, just for a second, and he said 'Go ahead.' And I whispered to her, 'You know I think I can get that gun.' And I said, 'Do you mind?' and she got kind of fearful about it, so I figured since there's two lives involved, not just mine, I won't do it.\n\"\"So I let her tie me up on the wrists again, and he tied her up, - terribly tight, you know, real... (unintelligible) ... put his gun away, and we were talking and all, bantering, you know, basically. I was thinking, anything I can do to help, by the way just to keep the conversation going... Suddenly he was taking it all seriously, you know... So I was starting out and finally he said, 'Okay, lay down. I've got her tied up', you know... He strung a rope between our ankles in the rear, so we were like this, you know, on our stomachs, tied...\n\"\"J.R. You both facing the ground...\n\"\"B.H. Right. And, oh, this was before. I got sort of ahead. So anyway, he said, 'Get down,' and I said, 'Oh come on! We could freeze to death!' I said that a couple, three times, and he said, 'GET DOWN! RIGHT NOW!' He got a little pushed off at me. So I got down and then he finished tying her up and clonked her down, - and then he goes... Sswhooosh (a sound with his mouth)... (unintelligible)\nPage 4\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"And so I said, 'Do you have bullets in there?' And so he pulled out the clip and showed me that he did. The bullets were about this long, I can remember, and about this fat, and they had the regular red cap on it, about this long. Maybe that doesn't give you any better description of the gun or not. I don't know. And it came out of the heel, the grip, you know. It slipped out from the bottom.\n\"\"And now, to backtrack a bit. I was really trying to see what he looked like, you know. He had on pleated pants, these old type of suit pants, you know, and they were either black or dark blue, I can't remember now. And I can't remember what he was wearing for shoes. But he had on this cotton coat, You've seen the kind, that you just turn the collar up once, there's a zipper down the front, you know. They're real light, super-thin, you know...\n\"\"J.R. Kind of a windbreaker...\n\"\"B.H. Yeah, like a windbreaker. And it's got this blue, this little collar, sometimes the guys wear them standing up, you know.\n\"\"J.R. What color was that?\n\"\"B.H. That was dark blue. And I don't know. Maybe he had something in his pouch. I just took it as being a... as being a... you know, he was stout 'cause he looked kind of heavy. I think he was weighing two and a quarter, two fifty, somewhere in there. And I got kind of a look at his hair. His voice... I can remember... almost like I'd heard it before. You know there's some drawls that a lot of people have similar. And... almost as if I'd heard it before... couldn't think where.\n\"\"I gave that one up, I just gave it up on that angle. I looked through his hair. I kind of looked like it was combed, you know, like this.. it was a brownish, you know, dark brown hair.\n\"\"And this mask he had on. It was ingeniously devised. It was... he had four corners at the top, like the top of a paper sack... black. It came down, came down, with the front panel about to here, and a kind of a thing that came over the shoulders, you know, and then the same thing down the back, straight down. And in the front he had a circle with a symmetrical cross in the middle. You know what I mean by a symmetrical cross?\nPage 5\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. Um hum (affirmative).\n\"\"B.H. The ends of the cross hung out about this far on each of the... you know, where it came out. The circle was this much... like this... and then it was like this, you see... hung out on the end, over the edge of the circle.\n\"\"And he had clip-on sunglasses... it was hard to tell. You know, the sunglasses you clip on when you're wearing glasses, eyeglasses, He had those clipped on. I'm pretty sure... I don't think he had glasses, though. I think he just had these clipped on to his suit... you know, that little mask.\n\"\"And I don't know how tall he was. Maybe 5-8 or maybe 5-10, 6 feet, somewhere in there. I'm a very poor judge of height because of my height. I have no meaning, you know. It's always down, you know. It can never be up...\n\"\"And so I saw him put away his gun, and I was turning to say something to Celia, and all of a sudden I felt my back... just... no, I think I saw him pull it out.. I don't remember... I think I saw him whip out his knife and just start stabbing me in the back... CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP! I was just (makes a gutteral sound)... you know that kind of a sound... and Celia turned to see why I was (repeats gutteral sound), you know, and she just about fainted. She went hysterical... (unintelligible) ... and when he finally stopped... I mean he went over and... The doctor says there's six in the back, six wounds on my back. You ought to confirm that. One I've got went clear through the lung. I've got it draining. I did drain a couple pints of blood out as soon as I got here. I lost an awful lot of blood, I guess.\n\"\"We were down... I mean it was absolutely no question in my mind... when a person gets stabbed as many times as we did... we were going to die. I mean there'd be no reason to question it. But somehow I, you know, started (unintelligible)... I just knew there was too much I had to live for. I mean really it does happen... about getting depressed and everything... when you're young you always think about these things... you know you think about it... and when you've got someone forcing your hand, oh well, there was a lot of things I had to do. And what really kept me going... you know my parents are pretty Christian. I haven't been too much of a Christian myself... but if you believe in the principle you ask God to help you. Another thing, What was my only strength was knowing two things. One, that I did not want to die, and two, that I felt that whatever was\nPage 6\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n\"\"going to be was going to be, but I was going to try my damnedest to stay alive. And so, like I say, - before I left her I kissed her, and I said, 'Well,' I says, 'I'm gonna try to get help.'\n\"\"There was a boat kept circling around out there in the lake and we started yelling at it and finally it came within about 100 yards of the shore and turned off its motor and stayed there watching us for about fifteen minutes, and we were just screaming hysterically, trying to get their attention, you know, to come over here. Oh, I don't know, I guess they were afraid that the guy might be there in the bushes and they were liable to get choked or something. So finally he came up a little closer. I didn't have my glasses on... I was just swaying, you know... and I had gotten one of her hands free before they came, and so I kept trying to get her to untie me, and she couldn't, she was too weak, she said.\n\"\"So finally I just kept hollering and hollering, and she said, 'Turn around and let's see if I can do it again.' She finally got it. My hands and my feet were just pure numbness... they're still numb but I'm sure that will go 'way. But I finally got... (unintelligible)... untie her so she could kind of relax out. 'Cause it was a terrible position, you know, upon our stomachs... (unintelligible)...\n\"\"And so I started to go for help. I finally got myself fairly reconciled. I wasn't too worried about dying, if that was what was going to happen, but I knew I had to keep pushing on. I had to force myself into staying alive because it was... I could just see myself... you know, all sort of waves would come over... I just (coughing sound)... (unintelligible)... 'Well, you're not gonna give up this easy', you know. And, like I say, I just kept believing that God would do everything the best, if the thing was gonna happen, but I couldn't see any reason why my dying would be the best good. So I just played along with that.\n\"\"I just started to walk toward the road... everything blacked out on me... my visual... my mind was never blacked out, but my visual was. So I lay down... My eyes started to come open... I just saw a haze of trees, you know. In a little while I got up and went another twenty feet, and then the same thing happened... (unintelligible)... and sat down. Next thing I went clear... (unintelligible)... the road, and by that time I just fell... I just... I was trying so hard to go far I just went too far. Finally I heard this pickup\nPage 7\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"coming... I was just laying alongside the road, and that's where this guy picked me up.\n\"\"They weren't in any hurry at all, it didn't seem like, you know, but they finally called an ambulance. About fifteen minutes later it came... (unintelligible)... but I still believe... I've got feeling... starting to get a little pain to come through. But from the minute that knife blade went in, it was nothing but pure shock from there on. I just did not expect it. I didn't expect that he would do that. That was a variable I had completely left out. And I guess he just took off running after we started running. I don't know. I never saw him before and hope not to see him again... at least outside of a courtroom.\n\"\"It's hard for me to explain much more. I mean I'm trying to give you a kind of example of his technique. He had some rope cut up in his back pocket. And he had a ... well, I thought it was a police automatic because it was in one of these black leather cases, you know...\n\"\"J.R. Was it in a smooth case, or did it have a basket weave like..\n\"\"B.H. Can I have my glasses? Oh, they're not here. It was a smooth one, though.\n\"\"J.R. Did he have this hood down to about the middle of his chest?\n\"\"B.H. No, about like... well, I'll show you... Here... his stomach.. You know I could see his... (voice fades away)\n\"\"J.R. Okay. You said his hair looked dark brown. How could you see his hair?\n\"\"B.H. 'Cause I saw it from where those goggles fit. I looked so closely to find out. And when he turned you know they kind of flittered... I could see his hair. It looked kind of greasy.\n\"\"J.R. Now was he as heavy as I am?\n\"\"B.H. Well I can't say 'cause he wasn't wearing those type of clothes. They were sloppy clothes, you know. And he just had on this old pair of pleated pants. I don't know... How tall are you?\n\"\"J.R. I'm about five eleven.\nPage 8\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. Well, like I say, he was dressed kind of sloppily, you know. His pants real tight up here and his stomach kind of pouched a bit, you know. I don't know... it's hard to say 'cause I can't judge you with being in a suit and all, you know, and him not being professional-looking at all. He could be about the same. It's hard to say. He was so sloppily dressed.\n\"\"J.R. Bryan, you also mentioned a drawl. Well not a drawl, an accent.\n\"\"B.H. It was just something... I guess his way of talking. It was something I couldn't repeat. It's like a song. Sometimes you know what you're going to say but you just can't sing the melody worth a darn.\n\"\"J.R. Did he have a throaty voice or a high pitched?\n\"\"B.H. In between. But it was just a unique way of talking.\n\"\"J.R. Did he sound like an educated man?\n\"\"B.H. Heck no! I don't think so.\n\"\"J.R. Did he sound illiterate?\n\"\"B.H. No. He didn't sound that way either. He just impressed me as being rather low class. The reason was because of his clothes, you know.\n\"\"J.R. Did you lose consciousness when he stabbed you at any time? Did you observe him stab Cecelia?\n\"\"B.H. Yeah...\n\"\"J.R. What did he say after...\n\"\"B.H. He stabbed her a bunch of times in the back. After she turned around, he got her once in the groin and one in the arm I think. He kind of went a little more hog-wild with her than with me. I faked dead... like that... I didn't want him to come back and give me some more.\n\"\"J.R. So you were pretty sure he thought you were dead when he finished working on you?\nPage 9\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. I think he kind of thought that. Of course I don't know because we started talking right after he left. It's hard to say... (unintelligible)... I don't think she fainted either.\n\"\"J.R. Was she in a lot of pain, did she tell you?\n\"\"B.H. Oh yeah. She was more weak at the time... (unintelligible).. from the religious angle. I told her I sure as heck wasn't going to have any deathbed conversion. 'No,' she says... (unintelligible)... I mean it was just like you were gonna die and had a few things to say. But I felt more and more I wasn't losing strength as much... (unintelligible)... that I thought I could cope with...\n\"\"J.R. What you did was a courageous thing. It was a terrible thing to have happen to anyone.\n\"\"B.H. Well there was nothing we could do. We were kind of at the mercy of him. I mean I wanted to get that gun... (unintelligible)... There was a time I think I could have gotten it...\n\"\"J.R. Did it appear to be a .45 to you? An automatic?\n\"\"B.H. It was about this long... along the stock... and had a wood edge on it, you know.. on either side...\n\"\"J.R. Handles.\n\"\"B.H. Yeah...yeah...\n\"\"J.R. Did the bullet look anything like that?\n\"\"B.H. No. It was kind of like this, only it was gold, and this part here came out along with this and then round the gold, round the blunt end. Not quite that blunt-ended, though.\n\"\"J.R. Was it fat? Fatter than this?\n\"\"B.H. Yeah, I think it was a little fatter. But it was gold, you know. And I didn't see any of this here. There was a part where it crimped... Well, almost like that 22, short, only a lot bigger. It was about like this length, maybe more stubby.\nPage 10\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n\"\"J.R. Well I'll get a .45 a little later and we can bring it up and let you observe it.\n\"\"B.H. \"\"Let's take the suspect. His hands... I don't remember if they had gloves on or not. I can't remember now. I keep thinking that he had gloves on. I can't figure how he tied us... Let's ask Celia, she probably knows about that.\n\"\"J.R. Did he swear? Did he use any profane language or obscenity?\n\"\"B.H. I don't think so. If he did it was no more than I was using at the time. I don't think he used any obscenity. He might have used a swear word or something, you know. That wasn't striking to me...\n\"\"J.R. Do you have any idea what his motive might have been? Money?\n\"\"B.H. Money. He said he was going to go to Mexico and he was flat broke.\n\"\"J.R. Did he search you after he...\n\"\"B.H. Heck no! Very unprofessional. He didn't even end up taking that loose change and didn't even take my billfold.\n\"\"J.R. Why did he stab you when you weren't fighting him off or anything?\n\"\"B.H. I couldn't. Even if I'd have wanted to. I was laying on my stomach...\n\"\"J.R. So what would have been the purpose of him to stab you, do you think?\n\"\"B.H. Well I (unintelligible)...but I think he got rattled... (unintelligible)... very, very nervous. His hands were shaking... (unintelligible)... Are you nervous?\n\"\"J.R. I'm just curious. If you could write me that symbol you were telling me about. Do you think you could draw me a picture of that even without your glasses?\n\"\"B.H. Um hum (affirmative). (Draws)... kind of like that. I can't see very well...\nPage 11\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. Yes, I see. Okay...\n\"\"B.H. ... (unintelligible)... that I could really die...\n\"\"J.R. Does this ring a bell?\n\"\"B.H. This one here. This is more like it, but I'm not sure. It was distinctly that design. It was thick. More thick marks.\n\"\"J.R. Okay. What color was this? Do you recall?\n\"\"B.H. Black. And that was white.\n\"\"J.R. This was black.\n\"\"B.H. No, that was white. It was about this tall.\n\"\"J.R. Two and a half, three inches?\n\"\"B.H. About four by four... three by three...\n\"\"J.R. How do you feel? Am I tiring you out too much?\n\"\"B.H. No. I've had a couple shots. It's not hurting me at all.\n\"\"J.R. Do you think Cecelia could tell me any more than you have already told me? Add anything?\n\"\"B.H. (unintelligible)\n\"\"J.R. Did he slap you around? Slap her?\n\"\"B.H. (unintelligible)... No.\n\"\"J.R. He was a much smaller man than you?\n\"\"B.H. Not much. About your height I guess. I don't know.\n\"\"J.R. Well you're getting kind of sleepy. I'll ease up on you.\n\"\"B.H. Have you gotten any clues at all?\n\"\"J.R. Yes, we've got some good clues. Before we get this guy it's going to take a lot of work.\n\"\"B.H. Remember he said he was headed for Mexico,\nPage 12\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. He's headed for Mexico?\n\"\"B.H. That's what he said.\n\"\"J.R. I'll leave you my card. It's right up here. I'm going to go down and talk to your mom and dad.\n\"\"B.H. Have the news heard about this at all?\n\"\"J.R. Yes.\n\"\"B.H. Was there anything in the paper today?\n\"\"J.R. No, it wasn't in...\n\"\"B.H. The Napa paper?\n\"\"J.R. Well there's no Napa paper on Sundays. It's been on the news media...\n\"\"B.H. Names? Did they name my name?\n\"\"J.R. I don't know, to tell you the truth.\n\"\"B.H. The reason I asked is my girl friend lives in Portland and I've got to talk to her before it gets to her...\n\"\"J.R. Okay\n\"\"B.H. What time is it now?\n\"\"J.R. It's one o'clock\n\"\"B.H. What are the rates now?\n\"\"J.R. Don't you worry about the rates.\n\"\"B.H. Well I should probably give her a call...\n\"\"J.R. You're looking real good. You've got some color...\n\"\"B.H. Is there a phone real close by?\n\"\"J.R. I'll get the nurse...\n\"\"B.H.

BYRD advised that MISS JUDY was a student at the college and had left the college earlier in the afternoon, driving a yellow Datsun. At 2135 hours Reporting Officers put out an All Points Bulletin around the City and County of Napa for this above described vehicle. At 2137 hours Officers received permission to interview the victim BRYAN HARTNELL who was taken to the X-Ray Room for x-rays. Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Lonergan attempted to interview BRYAN HARTNELL while in the presence of DONALD JUDAH and hospital attendant CLIFFORD MEAGHER. Sgt. Narlow was called away to answer a phone before the interview got under way. HARTNELL appeared to be in extreme pain and also appeared to be in shock. Reporting Officer Lonergan introduced himself to HARTNELL and asked him to give us any information he had on his assailant. HARTNELL stated that the assailant was wearing a black ceremonial type hood, square on top, and appeared to be heavy-set, between 200 and 250 pounds. He also stated his assailant had approached both him and MISS SHEPARD with a gun but had stabbed them with a long knife. HARTNELL further stated the gun was in a black holster and the knife was in a sheath. He stated that the attacker was wearing dark clothing, dark jacket and dark pants. HARTNELL further stated that the gun was an automatic pistol and the knife had a black handle and appeared to be homemade.\nIt should be noted that HARTNELL was very groggy and he was very difficult to interview at that time. Subject was re-interviewed the next day by Det/Sgt. Robertson and gave more complete details. (The report of Sgt. Robertson's interview is attached.)\nAt 2215 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan left the Queen of the Valley Hospital after advising Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and William Munk to take charge of the clothing of the victims and any other evidence from the victims when it was released from the hospital. Munk and Brambrink were also advised to stand by at the hospital as a security measure until other arrangements could be made.\nAs Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan were arriving at the Napa County Sheriff's Office, they were advised by the Napa Police Department that they had located MISS JUDY in the downtown Napa area and were bringing her to the Napa County Sheriff's Office. MISS [JUDY] was interviewed by Lonergan and Narlow at the Napa County Sheriff's Office. She was further identified as MISS JUDITH, a student at Pacific Union College, with a permanent residence address of Sun Valley, California. MISS [JUDITH] advised that she was with BRYAN\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

She stated that they all left Pacific Union College together at approximately 1:00 P.M. and went to a rummage sale in the City of St. Helena. She stated that BRYAN had bought a T.V. set at the rummage sale and had to transport it back to his room at Pacific Union College. She stated he left CECELIA at the rummage sale as there was not enough room in his car. MISS [JUDITH] stated BRYAN returned to the St. Helena area and picked up CECELIA at approximately 2:00 P.M. MISS [JUDITH] stated as far as she knew, both BRYAN and CECELIA were planning to go to San Francisco when they left her in St. Helena. MISS [JUDITH] stated she had no knowledge of any plans that BRYAN and CECELIA were making to go to the Lake Berryessa area. MISS [JUDITH] stated the last time she saw BRYAN and CECELIA was approximately 2:00 P.M. in the afternoon.\nThe interview with MISS [JUDITH] was terminated at that point.\nDet/Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow then proceeded to Lake Berryessa and arrived at the scene of the crime, which was approximately a mile and a half north of Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters, at 2354 hours. The scene was being preserved by uniformed officers and under the direct control of Deputy Sheriffs David Collins and Ray Land. The investigating officers were briefed by Officers Collins and Land as to what had taken place prior to our arrival. Officers observed a 1956 white Kharman Ghia with a black vinyl top, Oregon license plate 4 U 2040.

These items consisted of a blanket, a pair of man's shoes, a wallet belonging to BRYAN HARTNELL, eyeglasses, and playing cards. Among the various aforementioned items believed to belong to the victims, were numerous strands of white plastic line cut into various assorted lengths, some of which had what appeared to be bloodstains. These items were subsequently turned over to Det/Sgt. Hal Snook for preservation.\nAssigned investigators then proceeded back to the scene where the victim's car was parked and assisted Sgt. Snook in the making of the plaster casts. At approximately 0245 hours Sgt. Lonergan, having previously obtained the keys to the vehicle from BRYAN HARTNELL's property at Queen of the Valley Hospital, drove the white Kharman Ghia to the maintenance shop at Berryessa Park Headquarters. The vehicle was parked inside of the maintenance shop building and the building was secured for the evening by investigating officers with the assistance of Park Ranger Dennis Land. Assigned Investigators then returned back to the scene where the victim's vehicle had been previously parked and awaited the arrival of Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and Mel Fechter who were assigned to security duty in the crime scene area. At approximately 0300 hours officers assumed their duties at the crime scene area and the security was placed under the direction of Deputy Allen Brambrink. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then returned to their respective residences with plans to continue the investigation at daybreak.\n9/28/69 0700 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene at Lake Berryessa area, accompanied by Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Capt. Donald Townsend, and Sgt. James Munk. Officers then assisted Det/Sgt. Snook in tracking the footprints from the vehicle to the scene of the crime by the beach area. (The location and preservation of aforementioned footprints will be detailed in a supplementary evidence report by Sgt. Snook.)\nAt 0800 hours Reporting Officers Lonergan and Narlow received information via Park Headquarters that a DR. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his son would like to talk to them at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop regarding a possible suspect in this crime. At 0912 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan contacted DR. R. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his 16-yr. old son DAVID LEE RAYFIELD at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop. DR. RAYFIELD gave a home address of Los Gatos, California. DR. RAYFIELD stated that about 6:30 P.M. the previous evening he and his son had parked their car north of Park Headquarters in the general area of the\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts.

They stated they went down towards the beach area when DAVID RAYFIELD noticed a white male adult subject walking in the area, described as about 5'10\"\", heavy build, wearing dark trousers, a dark shirt with red in it, long sleeves. He stated this subject was carrying nothing in his hands and was apparently just walking alongside the hill area about halfway between the road and the lake. DAVID further stated that when the subject observed him he turned around and walked up the hill in a southerly direction. DR. RAYFIELD and his son stated that they did not notice a vehicle in the area of their vehicle and only this subject at a distance of about 100 yards. They also advised there was a man with two young boys in the area shooting B-B guns, but they did not know if this man saw the subject or not. This location was approximately 8/10ths of a mile from the scene of the victim's vehicle. In the opinion of R/Os, it is unlikely, unless this male subject had a vehicle in the immediate area, he could have traversed the area to the scene of the crime on foot.

She also advised White that the suspect had what appeared to be clip-on sunglasses to cover his eyes. Ranger Sgt. White stated that this is the most he could get out of either victim as they were both in great shock and pain. White stated that he noticed a lot of blood near the girl's groin area. The interview with Ranger Sgt. White was terminated at that point.\n9/28/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort and interviewed MR. ARCHIE E. WHITE. (It should be noted that ARCHIE E. WHITE and ELIZABETH WHITE are no relation to Ranger Sgt. White.) ARCHIE E. WHITE is the owner of the Boat Repair Shop at Rancho Monticello Resort.

MISS [JOANNE] advised R/O that on 9/27/69 at approximately 5:30 P.M. she and her two girlfriends parked their vehicle at a location two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. When they left their car they noticed a subject driving a late model silver blue Chevrolet, 2-door sedan, pull up behind them. What appeared to be a white male adult was sitting in the vehicle. They did not observe this subject leave the vehicle. The girls proceeded to the beach area and were sunbathing in their bikinis. After approximately one-half hour had passed, they observed what appeared to be the same subject standing within 40 or 50 feet of them, apparently observing them. This subject was described as 6' tall, weighing 200/210 lbs., muscular build, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing dark pants and a dark pullover shirt. The subject would stare at the three girls but when they looked up at him he would look away. The subject hung around the area for approximately 45 minutes and then the girls observed him walk up the hill. MISS [JOANNE] stated it was very doubtful that from his vantage point in the vehicle the subject could observe the three girls on the beach. She believes he waited in his vehicle and then followed them down after they were on the beach. MISS [JOANNE] further described the car as appearing very conservative. She stated the car did not appear to belong to any young person such as a teenager. She did state the car had California license plates but did not notice the number.\nThe other two young ladies, MISS [LINDA] and MISS [LINDA] were interviewed by Sgt. Snook and Capt.

Subject was described by MISS [LINDA] as approximately 28 years of age, 6' to 6'2\"\" tall, 200/225 lbs., black hair possibly styled, with a part on left, rounded eyes, thin lips, medium nose, straight eyebrows, small ears, well built, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing a black short-sleeved sweater shirt, bunched up in front, and a white tee shirt hanging out in back, and dark trousers. The three girls left the area about 4:30 P.M. and the subject's vehicle was gone. Witnesses did not observe the subject either leave or get back into his vehicle.\nMISS LINDA LEE was interviewed by R/O Capt. Donald Townsend. MISS [LINDA LEE] is a WFA, DOB [blank], address Howell Mountain Road, Angwin. MISS [LINDA LEE] is employed as a secretary of the college press. MISS [LINDA LEE] observed the same vehicle which was described as a late model Chevrolet, sky blue in color. The rear tail lights appeared to be long rather than round. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated they parked their vehicle at approximately 2:55 P.M. and observed the subject in his vehicle at that location. The girls proceeded to the beach and she, MISS [LINDA LEE], again noticed the subject about 30 to 45 minutes after they were at the beach. She noticed him standing on the bank approximately 45 yards from her location. She described the subject as 6 feet tall, stocky build, about 200 lbs., black short-sleeved sweater shirt, dark blue slacks, and straight dark hair neatly combed. She guessed his age at approximately 30 years. Subject had medium color skin and was not wearing glasses. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated she thought she saw a white belt around his back but it possibly was a tee shirt hanging out. She further stated that the man was fairly nice-looking, with a round face. She did not observe the subject leave the area in his vehicle.\n9/29/69 - 1600 hours Reporting Officers Sgt. Narlow and Sgt. Lonergan were advised by Capt.

[BASSEL] most Air Force personnel and many of the civilian personnel employed at Air Force bases had this type of shoe. The sole design of this shoe exactly matched the plaster cast design that Sgt. Snook had taken at the scene of the crime. It should be noted that Det/Sgt John Robertson had attempted to find a similar shoe design at the local shoe stores in the Napa area with negative results. (Refer Sgt. Robertson's supplementary report.) MR. [BASSEL] was asked if we could keep his shoes for identification purposes and he agreed.

Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan advised the Air Force personnel present of the portion of the evidence we had discovered at the crime scene and asked them for assistance in locating where this type of shoe was sold or issued. LT. COL. advised that his office would assist assigned investigators in attempting to locate the source of the shoe.\nOfficers were directed to the Base Supply with the assistance of Special Agent DONALD of O.S.I., at which time it was determined through Base Supply that this shoe in question was of Government issue and that it was not kept in stock at Base Supply, however it was believed that the Sales Store had such an item. It was then explained that if a military person or civilian employee was determined to be in need of such an item, he first reported to the Base Supply, at which time he was issued a purchase requisition which he in turn took to the Sales Store and the type of shoe was issued to the individual and they in turn required the individual to sign the purchase requisition showing that he did receive the item. This purchase requisition states the type of shoe that the individual was to receive, however makes no reference as to size.\nAssigned investigators, accompanied by Special Agent proceeded to the Sales Store located on Travis Air Force Base. After a short period of time R/Os located in stock a shoe fitting the identical description of the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast which officers had in their possession. The identical shoe with identical tread was found and a shoe bearing the closest measurements in the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast was measured and found to be a size 10 1/2 in military styling or a 10 1/2 D in civilian equivalent.

Air Force records indicate this type shoe is manufactured by the International Shoe Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, then shipped to Air Force Depot, Ogden, Utah, and from there shipped to the various military installations upon requisition orders.\n10/1/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then proceeded to the Vallejo Police Department and met with Sgt. Jack Mullanax and Sgt. Duane Nilsson. Officers exchanged information regarding Vallejo's crime of 7/4/69 and our particular incident. Suspect information was exchanged and is listed in the separate suspect file.\nInvestigating Officers checked to determine the validity of the decoded message and as to how far the original cyphers had been decoded. It was then learned that the message had been decoded by at least two different sources, one being by MR. and MRS. HARDIN of Salinas and the other by the FBI in Washington. It was noted that these cyphers were broken independent of one another and the FBI confirmed the validity of the original decoded message. It was also learned that there was a small portion on the very end of the coded message that had not been decoded for reasons unknown.\nThe balance of the afternoon and evening Reporting Officers and other investigating officers met to exchange information and further discuss the evidence at hand.\nThursday, October 2nd, 1969, 0845 hours Reporting Officer Lonergan received a telephone call from Special Agent, OSI, Travis Air Force Base.

According to the doctors at the hospital, this subject was capable of committing this type of a crime. R/O in the presence of JAMES and Security Officer PHIL RYAN interviewed subject FRANKLIN. FRANKLIN was very cooperative and talkative to R/O and went over his activities the prior weekend. Briefly stated, MR. FRANKLIN, whose parents live in Vallejo, never left the Vallejo area that weekend and stayed around home talking with his mother, stepfather, and three brothers. After interviewing subject, it was the opinion of R/O Sgt. Lonergan that this subject was not the responsible. He had a definite very fast manner of speaking which was completely opposed to the victim's statement concerning the suspect's voice. R/O also contacted the mother of the suspect, a MRS. OPAL at Hollywood Avenue, Vallejo. MRS. OPAL stated more or less the exact same thing that her son had stated as to his whereabouts that weekend. It appears that this subject has a reliable alibi as to his activities and had no access to a vehicle that weekend.

MISS SHEPARD said, \"\"Oh my God, he has a gun!\"\"\nVictim HARTNELL stated the man approached the couple, aiming a black steel automatic pistol. The suspect stated he needed a car and money. Suspect stated his car was \"\"hot\"\" and he wanted victim HARTNELL's car keys. Victim HARTNELL stated he began talking with the suspect, telling the suspect he had no money, only a small amount of change, also that if the suspect was really in need of assistance HARTNELL would attempt to help him. The suspect told victim to get on the ground. Suspect then had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him. HARTNELL stated he attempted to keep the suspect engaged in conversation while suspect was tying the victims.\nHARTNELL further stated the suspect was described as follows: Wearing a black hooded mask (cloth), covering suspect's entire head and shoulders, coming down almost to suspect's waist. Victim stated on front of the four-cornered type mask (similar to paper bag in style) there was a symbol, the symbol described as white, approximately 3 x 3 inches in diameter, with a symmetrical cross. Also on the eyelets of the mask was a pair of clip-on sunglasses, the glasses clipped to the eyelets. Victim stated he could also see hair through the mask's eyelets and observed the hair to be dark brown.\nVictim stated suspect was wearing a light-weight windbreaker, dark blue or black, pleated slacks (old-fashioned type). Victim could not remember what type of shoes or anything about suspect's hands, could not remember if suspect was wearing gloves.\nVictim thought suspect was possibly 20 to 30 years of age by voice concept. Victim stated suspect was 5'8\"\" to 6', 225-250 lbs., dark brown hair, eyes unknown, sloppy dresser, stomach hanging over trousers. Suspect spoke with some\nPage 17\n(2)\ntype of drawl, but victim stated it was not a Southern drawl, did not really know what type of drawl, but thought the man was not well educated, but did not feel he was illiterate either. Victim said suspect's voice was moderate in sound, that is, not high or low pitched.\nSuspect told victim he was sent to (?) Lodge State Prison (possibly Deer Lodge State Prison), Montana, for a killing. While there (in prison) he killed a guard while escaping. Suspect also told victims he was heading for Mexico, told victim he was flat broke.\nVictim observed cut-up rope in suspect's rear pocket (trouser's), also stated he was wearing a knife in a case (on belt) on his right side, near front of trousers. Knife description: Appeared to be a long bread knife, 12\"\" long blade, 3/4\"\" wide, hardwood handle, 2 brass rivets holding handle in place, cotton surgical tape wrapped approximately 1\"\" around handle of knife. Knife case possibly made of wood.\nVictim asked suspect if suspect's gun was loaded. Suspect removed magazine from handle of pistol and showed victim a bullet removed from gun, bullet described as a possible .45 caliber. Victim did not know what caliber the pistol was.\nSuspect had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him, suspect then tied victim SHEPARD's hands, then re-tied HARTNELL's hands, then tied both victims' ankles together, had victims lie on their stomachs. HARTNELL stated suspect said, \"\"I'm getting nervous.\"\" This was when suspect was tying MISS SHEPARD'S hands, in fact HARTNELL stated suspect got real shaky when he was tying MISS SHEPARD's hands.\nVictim HARTNELL then stated that without warning the suspect plunged his knife into the back of HARTNELL. Suspect did this repeatedly, HARTNELL stated he thinks six times. HARTNELL stated he pretended to be dead and the suspect went over to MISS SHEPARD and stabbed MISS SHEPARD repeatedly in the back, and when MISS SHEPARD turned her body over (on back), suspect stabbed her in the lower abdomen. Victim stated suspect stabbed MISS SHEPARD much worse than him. Suspect went into some sort of frenzy when stabbing MISS SHEPARD.\nVictim HARTNELL stated suspect left the area after the stabbing. Victim HARTNELL hailed a boat (off shore) and told the man in the boat the couple needed help badly. Victim stated the boat left the area and he (victim) attempted to get help by crawling and walking to the road. (Victim believed he had walked to the road, however had not gone too far from his wounded companion.)\nVictim stated he thought suspect had been with the couple for approximately fifteen (15) minutes from time of observing suspect until suspect departed. Victim stated suspect did not take his wallet, although when MISS SHEPARD was tying victim HARTNELL's hands, she reached in his pocket and threw his wallet to suspect. Suspect did not take the wallet or victim's car keys.\nVictim stated a man in a pickup truck found him on the road and called an ambulance. Victim stated he estimated one hour in time was involved between the time he and MISS SHEPARD were stabbed until help arrived.\nMISS SHEPARD is listed in critical condition.\n\n-------\n\nTranscript\nPage 1\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-321-F9-5861\nSgt. ROBERTSON stated that Mr. HARTNELL was heavily sedated but was able to give a verbal statement pertaining to the attack at Lake Berrysessa. The interview was taped and reads as follows:\n\"\"INTERVIEW OF JOHN ROBERTSON, DET/SGT., NAPA COUNTY SHERIFF's DEPARTMENT, WITH BRYAN CALVIN HARTNELL (NSO CASE #105907) AT QUEEN OF THE VALLEY HOSPITAL ON SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1969 (TRANSCRIBED FROM TAPE RECORDING BY M. FEURLE):\n\"\"J.R. Can you give me this fellow's description and tell me what happened?\n\"\"B.H. So many people have been asking me... I hope...\n\"\"J.R. Well sometimes when we're repetitious, I know it happens to me, I tell the same thing over and over and over, and sometimes I might vary a little, and if you do...\n\"\"B.H. Shall I just start out and tell you what happened?\n\"\"J.R. I don't want to tire you out.\n\"\"B.H. I just don't want this to happen again to anybody... Of course he might have his reasons, I don't know...\n\"\"J.R. Okay. Go right ahead. Start right from the beginning. What happened?\n\"\"B.H. Okay. This girl came out from school, I used to go with her two years ago, and she's now going to another school, and she came up to visit some friends and we were having dinner at the school cafeteria, and I said, 'Well, are you doing anything special this afternoon?' and she said, 'Why?', and I said, 'I don't know. We could go out and either go for a walk, go to San Francisco, or, you know, just...', 'cause we used to be good friends. We used to have a good friendship. And so it got too late by the time we got around to what we were going to do. We had to stop in St. Helena for a couple items and then we had to cart a couple kids home and stuff, and by the time we finally got around to it, it was getting late, and I thought going to San Francisco 'd rush you, you know, because by the time we got back for worship... And so we went out to Berryessa, and there was this one place I used to go out... we used to all the time, you know... and I couldn't find it. And so I figured Ah, forget it, and this looks like as good a place as any. So I parked the car, there were no other cars there. I had a Kharman Ghia, '56, white, with a black vinyl top, and it's in pretty\nPage 2\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n... \"\"good-looking shape. But we parked there on the road's edge and we talked Oh it must be about a quarter of a mile to down to the place where we went. We had... (unintelligible) peninsula, it's an an island I guess during the wetter season, You can see where it was levee... And so that looked like a lot... there was a big spreading tree up there. There were two of them, really, one was a little bigger than the other. We took the one that was out on the point.\n\"\"It was really beautiful out there. We were sitting on top... I lay down on my back and she lay down on her stomach beside me, you know, kind of resting her head on my shoulder, and we were talking, you know, kind of reminiscing about old times, and stuff. And I heard these rustling leaves, and I said, 'You have your specs on. Why don't you see what the deal is over there?' And she says, 'Oh, it's some man.' And I said, 'Is he alone?' and she said, 'Yeah... (unintelligible)...' and she says, 'Well he just stepped behind the tree.' And I said, 'What's the idea of that? To take a leak?' You know, 'cause that's the only thing I could think of, just step behind a tree. And so I says, 'Well, keep looking and tell me what happens,' and she says, 'Oh my God, he's got a gun!' and squeezed my arm and\n\"\"And so he came out, and of course still actually I wasn't... There's some things you really wouldn't mind having happen, just for the experience of it. You know I thought, Well I only got fifty cents on me. It's worth all of that having it happen. I didn't think about another angle. So I talked to him, you know. I said, 'Well listen, Mac, (you know I'm in the sociologist field, you know, I'm pre-law, with history and psych.) You know I've read about the criminal mind and everything, you know. I thought well maybe the guy really does need help, you know. I says, 'There's no strings attached.' I says, 'I don't have any money right now but if you need help that badly I can help you out in another way maybe.' And he says, 'Nah.. time's running short,' he says, ''cause I just got out of... some prison in Montana, I don't know what the name of it is. Feathers? Do you know what the name of it is? I'll see if it sounds familiar. Fern or Feathers? It's some double name, like Fern Lock or something...\n\"\"J.R. It's Lodge..\nPage 3\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. Oh yeah, yeah, Lodge. At least we know we're together on that.\n\"\"J.R. Mountain Lodge Prison, or something of that nature...\n\"\"B.H. Yeah. You know he said he broke out and had to kill a guard getting out. And I said, 'Well, man, I mean actually I don't mean to call your bluff or anything, but wouldn't you rather be stuck on a stealing charge than a threat of homicide?' you know? And he says, 'Well just don't start playing hero on me.' You know, 'Don't try to grab the gun,' 'cause I didn't really figure the gun was loaded. I always thought it would be empty. I've heard a lot of times that this is what they do just as a bluff, but I decided not to call his bluff after he really, you know... I told him, 'You know you're really wasting your time with me. I've got a billfold and this much change and that's it.' And he said, he told the girl, 'Go tie him up. I'd feel much better if you were tied up.' And she tied a couple of loose knots on me, so I made it look kind of tight... (unintelligible)... you know, just for a second, and he said 'Go ahead.' And I whispered to her, 'You know I think I can get that gun.' And I said, 'Do you mind?' and she got kind of fearful about it, so I figured since there's two lives involved, not just mine, I won't do it.\n\"\"So I let her tie me up on the wrists again, and he tied her up, - terribly tight, you know, real... (unintelligible) ... put his gun away, and we were talking and all, bantering, you know, basically. I was thinking, anything I can do to help, by the way just to keep the conversation going... Suddenly he was taking it all seriously, you know... So I was starting out and finally he said, 'Okay, lay down. I've got her tied up', you know... He strung a rope between our ankles in the rear, so we were like this, you know, on our stomachs, tied...\n\"\"J.R. You both facing the ground...\n\"\"B.H. Right. And, oh, this was before. I got sort of ahead. So anyway, he said, 'Get down,' and I said, 'Oh come on! We could freeze to death!' I said that a couple, three times, and he said, 'GET DOWN! RIGHT NOW!' He got a little pushed off at me. So I got down and then he finished tying her up and clonked her down, - and then he goes... Sswhooosh (a sound with his mouth)... (unintelligible)\nPage 4\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"And so I said, 'Do you have bullets in there?' And so he pulled out the clip and showed me that he did. The bullets were about this long, I can remember, and about this fat, and they had the regular red cap on it, about this long. Maybe that doesn't give you any better description of the gun or not. I don't know. And it came out of the heel, the grip, you know. It slipped out from the bottom.\n\"\"And now, to backtrack a bit. I was really trying to see what he looked like, you know. He had on pleated pants, these old type of suit pants, you know, and they were either black or dark blue, I can't remember now. And I can't remember what he was wearing for shoes. But he had on this cotton coat, You've seen the kind, that you just turn the collar up once, there's a zipper down the front, you know. They're real light, super-thin, you know...\n\"\"J.R. Kind of a windbreaker...\n\"\"B.H. Yeah, like a windbreaker. And it's got this blue, this little collar, sometimes the guys wear them standing up, you know.\n\"\"J.R. What color was that?\n\"\"B.H. That was dark blue. And I don't know. Maybe he had something in his pouch. I just took it as being a... as being a... you know, he was stout 'cause he looked kind of heavy. I think he was weighing two and a quarter, two fifty, somewhere in there. And I got kind of a look at his hair. His voice... I can remember... almost like I'd heard it before. You know there's some drawls that a lot of people have similar. And... almost as if I'd heard it before... couldn't think where.\n\"\"I gave that one up, I just gave it up on that angle. I looked through his hair. I kind of looked like it was combed, you know, like this.. it was a brownish, you know, dark brown hair.\n\"\"And this mask he had on. It was ingeniously devised. It was... he had four corners at the top, like the top of a paper sack... black. It came down, came down, with the front panel about to here, and a kind of a thing that came over the shoulders, you know, and then the same thing down the back, straight down. And in the front he had a circle with a symmetrical cross in the middle. You know what I mean by a symmetrical cross?\nPage 5\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. Um hum (affirmative).\n\"\"B.H. The ends of the cross hung out about this far on each of the... you know, where it came out. The circle was this much... like this... and then it was like this, you see... hung out on the end, over the edge of the circle.\n\"\"And he had clip-on sunglasses... it was hard to tell. You know, the sunglasses you clip on when you're wearing glasses, eyeglasses, He had those clipped on. I'm pretty sure... I don't think he had glasses, though. I think he just had these clipped on to his suit... you know, that little mask.\n\"\"And I don't know how tall he was. Maybe 5-8 or maybe 5-10, 6 feet, somewhere in there. I'm a very poor judge of height because of my height. I have no meaning, you know. It's always down, you know. It can never be up...\n\"\"And so I saw him put away his gun, and I was turning to say something to Celia, and all of a sudden I felt my back... just... no, I think I saw him pull it out.. I don't remember... I think I saw him whip out his knife and just start stabbing me in the back... CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP! I was just (makes a gutteral sound)... you know that kind of a sound... and Celia turned to see why I was (repeats gutteral sound), you know, and she just about fainted. She went hysterical... (unintelligible) ... and when he finally stopped... I mean he went over and... The doctor says there's six in the back, six wounds on my back. You ought to confirm that. One I've got went clear through the lung. I've got it draining. I did drain a couple pints of blood out as soon as I got here. I lost an awful lot of blood, I guess.\n\"\"We were down... I mean it was absolutely no question in my mind... when a person gets stabbed as many times as we did... we were going to die. I mean there'd be no reason to question it. But somehow I, you know, started (unintelligible)... I just knew there was too much I had to live for. I mean really it does happen... about getting depressed and everything... when you're young you always think about these things... you know you think about it... and when you've got someone forcing your hand, oh well, there was a lot of things I had to do. And what really kept me going... you know my parents are pretty Christian. I haven't been too much of a Christian myself... but if you believe in the principle you ask God to help you. Another thing, What was my only strength was knowing two things. One, that I did not want to die, and two, that I felt that whatever was\nPage 6\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n\"\"going to be was going to be, but I was going to try my damnedest to stay alive. And so, like I say, - before I left her I kissed her, and I said, 'Well,' I says, 'I'm gonna try to get help.'\n\"\"There was a boat kept circling around out there in the lake and we started yelling at it and finally it came within about 100 yards of the shore and turned off its motor and stayed there watching us for about fifteen minutes, and we were just screaming hysterically, trying to get their attention, you know, to come over here. Oh, I don't know, I guess they were afraid that the guy might be there in the bushes and they were liable to get choked or something. So finally he came up a little closer. I didn't have my glasses on... I was just swaying, you know... and I had gotten one of her hands free before they came, and so I kept trying to get her to untie me, and she couldn't, she was too weak, she said.\n\"\"So finally I just kept hollering and hollering, and she said, 'Turn around and let's see if I can do it again.' She finally got it. My hands and my feet were just pure numbness... they're still numb but I'm sure that will go 'way. But I finally got... (unintelligible)... untie her so she could kind of relax out. 'Cause it was a terrible position, you know, upon our stomachs... (unintelligible)...\n\"\"And so I started to go for help. I finally got myself fairly reconciled. I wasn't too worried about dying, if that was what was going to happen, but I knew I had to keep pushing on. I had to force myself into staying alive because it was... I could just see myself... you know, all sort of waves would come over... I just (coughing sound)... (unintelligible)... 'Well, you're not gonna give up this easy', you know. And, like I say, I just kept believing that God would do everything the best, if the thing was gonna happen, but I couldn't see any reason why my dying would be the best good. So I just played along with that.\n\"\"I just started to walk toward the road... everything blacked out on me... my visual... my mind was never blacked out, but my visual was. So I lay down... My eyes started to come open... I just saw a haze of trees, you know. In a little while I got up and went another twenty feet, and then the same thing happened... (unintelligible)... and sat down. Next thing I went clear... (unintelligible)... the road, and by that time I just fell... I just... I was trying so hard to go far I just went too far. Finally I heard this pickup\nPage 7\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"coming... I was just laying alongside the road, and that's where this guy picked me up.\n\"\"They weren't in any hurry at all, it didn't seem like, you know, but they finally called an ambulance. About fifteen minutes later it came... (unintelligible)... but I still believe... I've got feeling... starting to get a little pain to come through. But from the minute that knife blade went in, it was nothing but pure shock from there on. I just did not expect it. I didn't expect that he would do that. That was a variable I had completely left out. And I guess he just took off running after we started running. I don't know. I never saw him before and hope not to see him again... at least outside of a courtroom.\n\"\"It's hard for me to explain much more. I mean I'm trying to give you a kind of example of his technique. He had some rope cut up in his back pocket. And he had a ... well, I thought it was a police automatic because it was in one of these black leather cases, you know...\n\"\"J.R. Was it in a smooth case, or did it have a basket weave like..\n\"\"B.H. Can I have my glasses? Oh, they're not here. It was a smooth one, though.\n\"\"J.R. Did he have this hood down to about the middle of his chest?\n\"\"B.H. No, about like... well, I'll show you... Here... his stomach.. You know I could see his... (voice fades away)\n\"\"J.R. Okay. You said his hair looked dark brown. How could you see his hair?\n\"\"B.H. 'Cause I saw it from where those goggles fit. I looked so closely to find out. And when he turned you know they kind of flittered... I could see his hair. It looked kind of greasy.\n\"\"J.R. Now was he as heavy as I am?\n\"\"B.H. Well I can't say 'cause he wasn't wearing those type of clothes. They were sloppy clothes, you know. And he just had on this old pair of pleated pants. I don't know... How tall are you?\n\"\"J.R. I'm about five eleven.\nPage 8\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. Well, like I say, he was dressed kind of sloppily, you know. His pants real tight up here and his stomach kind of pouched a bit, you know. I don't know... it's hard to say 'cause I can't judge you with being in a suit and all, you know, and him not being professional-looking at all. He could be about the same. It's hard to say. He was so sloppily dressed.\n\"\"J.R. Bryan, you also mentioned a drawl. Well not a drawl, an accent.\n\"\"B.H. It was just something... I guess his way of talking. It was something I couldn't repeat. It's like a song. Sometimes you know what you're going to say but you just can't sing the melody worth a darn.\n\"\"J.R. Did he have a throaty voice or a high pitched?\n\"\"B.H. In between. But it was just a unique way of talking.\n\"\"J.R. Did he sound like an educated man?\n\"\"B.H. Heck no! I don't think so.\n\"\"J.R. Did he sound illiterate?\n\"\"B.H. No. He didn't sound that way either. He just impressed me as being rather low class. The reason was because of his clothes, you know.\n\"\"J.R. Did you lose consciousness when he stabbed you at any time? Did you observe him stab Cecelia?\n\"\"B.H. Yeah...\n\"\"J.R. What did he say after...\n\"\"B.H. He stabbed her a bunch of times in the back. After she turned around, he got her once in the groin and one in the arm I think. He kind of went a little more hog-wild with her than with me. I faked dead... like that... I didn't want him to come back and give me some more.\n\"\"J.R. So you were pretty sure he thought you were dead when he finished working on you?\nPage 9\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. I think he kind of thought that. Of course I don't know because we started talking right after he left. It's hard to say... (unintelligible)... I don't think she fainted either.\n\"\"J.R. Was she in a lot of pain, did she tell you?\n\"\"B.H. Oh yeah. She was more weak at the time... (unintelligible).. from the religious angle. I told her I sure as heck wasn't going to have any deathbed conversion. 'No,' she says... (unintelligible)... I mean it was just like you were gonna die and had a few things to say. But I felt more and more I wasn't losing strength as much... (unintelligible)... that I thought I could cope with...\n\"\"J.R. What you did was a courageous thing. It was a terrible thing to have happen to anyone.\n\"\"B.H. Well there was nothing we could do. We were kind of at the mercy of him. I mean I wanted to get that gun... (unintelligible)... There was a time I think I could have gotten it...\n\"\"J.R. Did it appear to be a .45 to you? An automatic?\n\"\"B.H. It was about this long... along the stock... and had a wood edge on it, you know.. on either side...\n\"\"J.R. Handles.\n\"\"B.H. Yeah...yeah...\n\"\"J.R. Did the bullet look anything like that?\n\"\"B.H. No. It was kind of like this, only it was gold, and this part here came out along with this and then round the gold, round the blunt end. Not quite that blunt-ended, though.\n\"\"J.R. Was it fat? Fatter than this?\n\"\"B.H. Yeah, I think it was a little fatter. But it was gold, you know. And I didn't see any of this here. There was a part where it crimped... Well, almost like that 22, short, only a lot bigger. It was about like this length, maybe more stubby.\nPage 10\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n\"\"J.R. Well I'll get a .45 a little later and we can bring it up and let you observe it.\n\"\"B.H. \"\"Let's take the suspect. His hands... I don't remember if they had gloves on or not. I can't remember now. I keep thinking that he had gloves on. I can't figure how he tied us... Let's ask Celia, she probably knows about that.\n\"\"J.R. Did he swear? Did he use any profane language or obscenity?\n\"\"B.H. I don't think so. If he did it was no more than I was using at the time. I don't think he used any obscenity. He might have used a swear word or something, you know. That wasn't striking to me...\n\"\"J.R. Do you have any idea what his motive might have been? Money?\n\"\"B.H. Money. He said he was going to go to Mexico and he was flat broke.\n\"\"J.R. Did he search you after he...\n\"\"B.H. Heck no! Very unprofessional. He didn't even end up taking that loose change and didn't even take my billfold.\n\"\"J.R. Why did he stab you when you weren't fighting him off or anything?\n\"\"B.H. I couldn't. Even if I'd have wanted to. I was laying on my stomach...\n\"\"J.R. So what would have been the purpose of him to stab you, do you think?\n\"\"B.H. Well I (unintelligible)...but I think he got rattled... (unintelligible)... very, very nervous. His hands were shaking... (unintelligible)... Are you nervous?\n\"\"J.R. I'm just curious. If you could write me that symbol you were telling me about. Do you think you could draw me a picture of that even without your glasses?\n\"\"B.H. Um hum (affirmative). (Draws)... kind of like that. I can't see very well...\nPage 11\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. Yes, I see. Okay...\n\"\"B.H. ... (unintelligible)... that I could really die...\n\"\"J.R. Does this ring a bell?\n\"\"B.H. This one here. This is more like it, but I'm not sure. It was distinctly that design. It was thick. More thick marks.\n\"\"J.R. Okay. What color was this? Do you recall?\n\"\"B.H. Black. And that was white.\n\"\"J.R. This was black.\n\"\"B.H. No, that was white. It was about this tall.\n\"\"J.R. Two and a half, three inches?\n\"\"B.H. About four by four... three by three...\n\"\"J.R. How do you feel? Am I tiring you out too much?\n\"\"B.H. No. I've had a couple shots. It's not hurting me at all.\n\"\"J.R. Do you think Cecelia could tell me any more than you have already told me? Add anything?\n\"\"B.H. (unintelligible)\n\"\"J.R. Did he slap you around? Slap her?\n\"\"B.H. (unintelligible)... No.\n\"\"J.R. He was a much smaller man than you?\n\"\"B.H. Not much. About your height I guess. I don't know.\n\"\"J.R. Well you're getting kind of sleepy. I'll ease up on you.\n\"\"B.H. Have you gotten any clues at all?\n\"\"J.R. Yes, we've got some good clues. Before we get this guy it's going to take a lot of work.\n\"\"B.H. Remember he said he was headed for Mexico,\nPage 12\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. He's headed for Mexico?\n\"\"B.H.

William White at Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters. White was interviewed as to his activities before and during his part in locating the victims the night before. White stated at approximately 1855 hours 9/27/69 he was on routine patrol around the Lake Berryessa area when he received a call from Park Headquarters to proceed to the Rancho Monticello Resort where a person was reporting a possible stabbing. \nWhite stated he proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort where he was contacted by ARCHIE E. WHITE, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG. RONALD FONG advised him that he had seen a male and a female victim on the beach area south of Rancho Monticello Resort, hollering that they had been stabbed. Ranger Sgt. White, accompanied by ARCHIE WHITE, ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the beach area via speedboat owned by ARCHIE WHITE. When they arrived on the beach they observed a young female lying on the ground with what appeared to be numerous stab wounds. \nRanger Sgt. White stated that the female appeared to be in a great deal of pain. White stated as they discovered the female victim, Ranger Dennis Land arrived at the scene in his pickup truck, carrying a male victim who also appeared to have numerous stab wounds. White stated he immediately radioed in and had Park Headquarters call the Sheriff's Office to dispatch an ambulance and a Deputy. White stated he attempted to interview both the boy and girl victims while awaiting arrival of the ambulance. According to White, the male victim said that a male subject approached them, wearing a hood, dressed in dark clothing. The subject was carrying what appeared to be an automatic pistol and stated that he wanted their money and car keys. \nAccording to White, the male victim related to him that the subject advised him he was an ex-con out of Colorado and was en route to Mexico. Suspect stated he had to tie them up, and after they were tied the responsible stated, \"\"I'm going to have to stab you.\"\" White further related that the male victim advised the responsible, \"\"Stab me first, I can't stand to see her stabbed first.\"\" The male victim then advised that the responsible stabbed him numerous times in the back and then stabbed the girl.\nThe female victim advised White that she could not see the responsible's face as a hood was covering all of his head. She also advised White that the suspect had what appeared to be clip-on sunglasses to cover his eyes. Ranger Sgt. White stated that this is the most he could get out of either victim as they were both in great shock and pain. White stated that he noticed a lot of blood near the girl's groin area. The interview with Ranger Sgt. White was terminated at that point.\n\n\",,\"rec7Fue7MIOL0uRL6,recwRee0DtTX3tRVn,recaQva0MW8dTOkOW,rec0sRHJ9eLbQJYsJ\",,,,reczLS0i9zVkwmRCs,,1969,September,Sunday,recmQK2TtG43z2t8t,Case Event,1969-09-28T13:20:00.000Z,9/28/1969 1:20PM,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Narlow%20and%20Lonergan%20interview%20William%20White&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Narlow%20and%20Lonergan%20interview%20William%20White&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2025-09-28T02:46:01.000Z,1:20 PM,,1969-09-28T13:20:00.000Z,,\"Title: NCSD Report on Lake Berryessa\n\nDate: 1969-10-05T00:00:00.000Z\n\nAuthor / Source: Napa County Sheriff's Department, Ken Narlow, Richard Lonergan, David Lee Rayfield, R.

BYRD advised that MISS JUDY was a student at the college and had left the college earlier in the afternoon, driving a yellow Datsun. At 2135 hours Reporting Officers put out an All Points Bulletin around the City and County of Napa for this above described vehicle. At 2137 hours Officers received permission to interview the victim BRYAN HARTNELL who was taken to the X-Ray Room for x-rays. Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Lonergan attempted to interview BRYAN HARTNELL while in the presence of DONALD JUDAH and hospital attendant CLIFFORD MEAGHER. Sgt. Narlow was called away to answer a phone before the interview got under way. HARTNELL appeared to be in extreme pain and also appeared to be in shock. Reporting Officer Lonergan introduced himself to HARTNELL and asked him to give us any information he had on his assailant. HARTNELL stated that the assailant was wearing a black ceremonial type hood, square on top, and appeared to be heavy-set, between 200 and 250 pounds. He also stated his assailant had approached both him and MISS SHEPARD with a gun but had stabbed them with a long knife. HARTNELL further stated the gun was in a black holster and the knife was in a sheath. He stated that the attacker was wearing dark clothing, dark jacket and dark pants. HARTNELL further stated that the gun was an automatic pistol and the knife had a black handle and appeared to be homemade.\nIt should be noted that HARTNELL was very groggy and he was very difficult to interview at that time. Subject was re-interviewed the next day by Det/Sgt. Robertson and gave more complete details. (The report of Sgt. Robertson's interview is attached.)\nAt 2215 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan left the Queen of the Valley Hospital after advising Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and William Munk to take charge of the clothing of the victims and any other evidence from the victims when it was released from the hospital. Munk and Brambrink were also advised to stand by at the hospital as a security measure until other arrangements could be made.\nAs Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan were arriving at the Napa County Sheriff's Office, they were advised by the Napa Police Department that they had located MISS JUDY in the downtown Napa area and were bringing her to the Napa County Sheriff's Office. MISS [JUDY] was interviewed by Lonergan and Narlow at the Napa County Sheriff's Office. She was further identified as MISS JUDITH, a student at Pacific Union College, with a permanent residence address of Sun Valley, California. MISS [JUDITH] advised that she was with BRYAN\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

She stated that they all left Pacific Union College together at approximately 1:00 P.M. and went to a rummage sale in the City of St. Helena. She stated that BRYAN had bought a T.V. set at the rummage sale and had to transport it back to his room at Pacific Union College. She stated he left CECELIA at the rummage sale as there was not enough room in his car. MISS [JUDITH] stated BRYAN returned to the St. Helena area and picked up CECELIA at approximately 2:00 P.M. MISS [JUDITH] stated as far as she knew, both BRYAN and CECELIA were planning to go to San Francisco when they left her in St. Helena. MISS [JUDITH] stated she had no knowledge of any plans that BRYAN and CECELIA were making to go to the Lake Berryessa area. MISS [JUDITH] stated the last time she saw BRYAN and CECELIA was approximately 2:00 P.M. in the afternoon.\nThe interview with MISS [JUDITH] was terminated at that point.\nDet/Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow then proceeded to Lake Berryessa and arrived at the scene of the crime, which was approximately a mile and a half north of Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters, at 2354 hours. The scene was being preserved by uniformed officers and under the direct control of Deputy Sheriffs David Collins and Ray Land. The investigating officers were briefed by Officers Collins and Land as to what had taken place prior to our arrival. Officers observed a 1956 white Kharman Ghia with a black vinyl top, Oregon license plate 4 U 2040. Investigating officers were shown footprints in dirt area and tire tracks, both believed to have been left by responsible. Investigating officers awaited the arrival of Sgt. Tom Butler who had been called to take photographs of the crime scene area and Sgt. Hal Snook, criminalist for collection and preservation of physical evidence. R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were advised by Park Ranger Dennis Land who had also arrived at the scene that it was possible to get to the beach area by vehicle from a locked gate approximately one-half mile south of the victim's vehicle. Officers proceeded to the area and arrived at the footpath approximately halfway between the scene of the crime at the beach and the victim's vehicle on the road. At that point, after a brief examination of the footpath area, officers discovered a similar footprint on the footpath to that found at the scene of the victim's vehicle. At that point, due to the lateness and darkness of the hour, Reporting Officers decided to completely secure the area and make a thorough search of the scene at first light. Officers then exited the crime scene area in the same manner and locked the aforementioned gate leading to this vicinity. Investigating officers along with Park Ranger Dennis Land went to the Berryessa Park Headquarters.\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

These items consisted of a blanket, a pair of man's shoes, a wallet belonging to BRYAN HARTNELL, eyeglasses, and playing cards. Among the various aforementioned items believed to belong to the victims, were numerous strands of white plastic line cut into various assorted lengths, some of which had what appeared to be bloodstains. These items were subsequently turned over to Det/Sgt. Hal Snook for preservation.\nAssigned investigators then proceeded back to the scene where the victim's car was parked and assisted Sgt. Snook in the making of the plaster casts. At approximately 0245 hours Sgt. Lonergan, having previously obtained the keys to the vehicle from BRYAN HARTNELL's property at Queen of the Valley Hospital, drove the white Kharman Ghia to the maintenance shop at Berryessa Park Headquarters. The vehicle was parked inside of the maintenance shop building and the building was secured for the evening by investigating officers with the assistance of Park Ranger Dennis Land. Assigned Investigators then returned back to the scene where the victim's vehicle had been previously parked and awaited the arrival of Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and Mel Fechter who were assigned to security duty in the crime scene area. At approximately 0300 hours officers assumed their duties at the crime scene area and the security was placed under the direction of Deputy Allen Brambrink. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then returned to their respective residences with plans to continue the investigation at daybreak.\n9/28/69 0700 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene at Lake Berryessa area, accompanied by Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Capt. Donald Townsend, and Sgt. James Munk. Officers then assisted Det/Sgt. Snook in tracking the footprints from the vehicle to the scene of the crime by the beach area. (The location and preservation of aforementioned footprints will be detailed in a supplementary evidence report by Sgt. Snook.)\nAt 0800 hours Reporting Officers Lonergan and Narlow received information via Park Headquarters that a DR. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his son would like to talk to them at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop regarding a possible suspect in this crime. At 0912 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan contacted DR. R. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his 16-yr. old son DAVID LEE RAYFIELD at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop. DR. RAYFIELD gave a home address of Los Gatos, California. DR. RAYFIELD stated that about 6:30 P.M. the previous evening he and his son had parked their car north of Park Headquarters in the general area of the\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts.

They stated they went down towards the beach area when DAVID RAYFIELD noticed a white male adult subject walking in the area, described as about 5'10\"\", heavy build, wearing dark trousers, a dark shirt with red in it, long sleeves. He stated this subject was carrying nothing in his hands and was apparently just walking alongside the hill area about halfway between the road and the lake. DAVID further stated that when the subject observed him he turned around and walked up the hill in a southerly direction. DR. RAYFIELD and his son stated that they did not notice a vehicle in the area of their vehicle and only this subject at a distance of about 100 yards. They also advised there was a man with two young boys in the area shooting B-B guns, but they did not know if this man saw the subject or not. This location was approximately 8/10ths of a mile from the scene of the victim's vehicle. In the opinion of R/Os, it is unlikely, unless this male subject had a vehicle in the immediate area, he could have traversed the area to the scene of the crime on foot. There are four coves of water between the scene of the crime and the area where the doctor saw the subject. The interview with DR. RAYFIELD and his son was terminated at that point.\nAt 1000 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene of the crime and further assisted Sgt. Snook in the collecting and locating of evidence.\nAt 1320 hours 9/28/69, R/Os interviewed Ranger Sgt. William White at Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters. White was interviewed as to his activities before and during his part in locating the victims the night before. White stated at approximately 1855 hours 9/27/69 he was on routine patrol around the Lake Berryessa area when he received a call from Park Headquarters to proceed to the Rancho Monticello Resort where a person was reporting a possible stabbing. \nWhite stated he proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort where he was contacted by ARCHIE E.

According to White, the male victim said that a male subject approached them, wearing a hood, dressed in dark clothing.

William White arrived at the Resort a short time later. MR. and MRS. WHITE, accompanied by Ranger Sgt. Bill White and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the scene area in one of MR. WHITE's ski boats. When they arrived on the scene, they observed a young female wearing a sweater dress lying on the beach, covered with blood. When they approached the area she was on her elbows and knees, rocking back and forth as if in great pain. MRS. WHITE stated she immediately attempted to make the victim more comfortable and tried to calm her down until the ambulance arrived. MRS.

WHITE further advised that the female victim told her that the responsible was wearing glasses, with dark clip-on sunglasses over the hood. She told her that the responsible had a black pistol. MR. ARCHIE WHITE stated he overheard the male victim advise someone that the responsible was wearing gloves. MR. and MRS. WHITE further advised that this is the only information either victim gave them on the responsible, and that they spent the balance of the time attempting to make the victim more comfortable until the arrival of the ambulance.\nAfter the interview with MR. and MRS. WHITE, Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan returned to the Napa County Sheriff's Office.\nAt 1620 hours R/O Det/Sgt. Narlow was contacted by a DEAN of the Pacific Union College in Angwin. DEAN advised that three young ladies, students at the college, might possibly have information as to a suspect in the attack at Lake Berryessa. The young ladies were identified as MISS JOANNE, MISS LINDA, and MISS LINDA. DEAN advised that these girls had been in the Lake Berryessa area from about 3:00 P.M. to 4:30 P.M. the previous Saturday afternoon. They had observed a male subject in a late model, silver blue Chevrolet, two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. DEAN advised that the girls had told him they were observed out of the car by this subject while they were sunbathing on the beach. They described the subject as approximately 40 years old, [blank] feet tall, dressed in dark clothing. Sgt. Narlow dispatched Deputy Sheriff Raymond Land to interview these three girls that evening. (The report of Land's interview is attached.)\nReporting Officers spent the balance of the day and evening going through their investigative notes and issuing a statewide All Points Bulletin.\nMonday, 9/29/69 Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan spent the majority of the morning interviewing numerous citizens and officers from other departments regarding this crime and similar crimes. (A general list of possible suspects was begun and they are noted on separate incident reports as to origin of information and description of suspects, attached.)\nReporting Officers were advised by Deputy Sheriff Ray Land who interviewed the three college girls, MISS [JOANNE], MISS [LINDA], and MISS [LINDA] that the information appeared to have some merit and advised that the three young ladies would be in the office in the afternoon for further interview.\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgt.

Donald Townsend.\nLonergan interviewed a MISS JOANNE MARIE, who, [age] years of age, DOB [blank], her address at the college is 114 Dauphine, Pacific Union College, home address South East 12th, College Place, Washington. MISS [JOANNE] advised R/O that on 9/27/69 at approximately 5:30 P.M. she and her two girlfriends parked their vehicle at a location two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. When they left their car they noticed a subject driving a late model silver blue Chevrolet, 2-door sedan, pull up behind them. What appeared to be a white male adult was sitting in the vehicle. They did not observe this subject leave the vehicle. The girls proceeded to the beach area and were sunbathing in their bikinis. After approximately one-half hour had passed, they observed what appeared to be the same subject standing within 40 or 50 feet of them, apparently observing them. This subject was described as 6' tall, weighing 200/210 lbs., muscular build, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing dark pants and a dark pullover shirt. The subject would stare at the three girls but when they looked up at him he would look away. The subject hung around the area for approximately 45 minutes and then the girls observed him walk up the hill. MISS [JOANNE] stated it was very doubtful that from his vantage point in the vehicle the subject could observe the three girls on the beach. She believes he waited in his vehicle and then followed them down after they were on the beach. MISS [JOANNE] further described the car as appearing very conservative. She stated the car did not appear to belong to any young person such as a teenager. She did state the car had California license plates but did not notice the number.\nThe other two young ladies, MISS [LINDA] and MISS [LINDA] were interviewed by Sgt. Snook and Capt.

Subject was described by MISS [LINDA] as approximately 28 years of age, 6' to 6'2\"\" tall, 200/225 lbs., black hair possibly styled, with a part on left, rounded eyes, thin lips, medium nose, straight eyebrows, small ears, well built, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing a black short-sleeved sweater shirt, bunched up in front, and a white tee shirt hanging out in back, and dark trousers. The three girls left the area about 4:30 P.M. and the subject's vehicle was gone. Witnesses did not observe the subject either leave or get back into his vehicle.\nMISS LINDA LEE was interviewed by R/O Capt. Donald Townsend. MISS [LINDA LEE] is a WFA, DOB [blank], address Howell Mountain Road, Angwin. MISS [LINDA LEE] is employed as a secretary of the college press. MISS [LINDA LEE] observed the same vehicle which was described as a late model Chevrolet, sky blue in color. The rear tail lights appeared to be long rather than round. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated they parked their vehicle at approximately 2:55 P.M. and observed the subject in his vehicle at that location. The girls proceeded to the beach and she, MISS [LINDA LEE], again noticed the subject about 30 to 45 minutes after they were at the beach. She noticed him standing on the bank approximately 45 yards from her location. She described the subject as 6 feet tall, stocky build, about 200 lbs., black short-sleeved sweater shirt, dark blue slacks, and straight dark hair neatly combed. She guessed his age at approximately 30 years. Subject had medium color skin and was not wearing glasses. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated she thought she saw a white belt around his back but it possibly was a tee shirt hanging out. She further stated that the man was fairly nice-looking, with a round face. She did not observe the subject leave the area in his vehicle.\n9/29/69 - 1600 hours Reporting Officers Sgt. Narlow and Sgt. Lonergan were advised by Capt.

DE PETRIS would complete the autopsy.\nAt 1945 hours 9/29/69, R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were contacted by Probation Officer H. B. Schotte. Mr. Schotte had observed the footprint design that R/Os had taken at the scene and stated he had knowledge of a possible similar shoe sole design. Mr. Schotte brought into the office a MR.

He described these boots as being Government issue, issued to all Air Force personnel at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. They are primarily designed as a wing-walker shoe, however according to MR. [BASSEL] most Air Force personnel and many of the civilian personnel employed at Air Force bases had this type of shoe. The sole design of this shoe exactly matched the plaster cast design that Sgt. Snook had taken at the scene of the crime. It should be noted that Det/Sgt John Robertson had attempted to find a similar shoe design at the local shoe stores in the Napa area with negative results. (Refer Sgt. Robertson's supplementary report.) MR. [BASSEL] was asked if we could keep his shoes for identification purposes and he agreed. R/Os was also advised that this information regarding the type of footprint had not been released to the press or general public. MR.

She stated shortly after they parked the vehicle they observed the victims who were known to them, BRYAN HARTNELL and CECELIA SHEPARD, driving south on Knoxville Road in BRYAN's white Kharman Ghia. She stated as the HARTNELL vehicle drove by, BRYAN waved out the window and said, \"\"Hi, John!\"\", referring to MR. [JOHN]. MISS [MARILYN] stated that they did not see the HARTNELL vehicle any other time that day.\n9/30/69, 0900 hours R/Os Det/Sgt. Narlow and Det/Sgt. Richard Lonergan, accompanied by Sgt.

Kenneth Narlow contacted CAPT. at Travis Air Force Base and arranged for an interview with COL. and SGT. to take place on Wednesday morning, October 1st, 1969, at 9:00 A.M. R/Os wanted to talk to someone at Travis regarding the shoeprints that were found on the scene. The remainder of the day and evening was spent in answering phone calls from people who had possible knowledge of the crime.\nWednesday, 10/1/69 - 0900 hours Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow went to Travis Air Force Base and were present at an interview in Col. office, who is Commanding Officer in charge of base security. Also present at this meeting besides the aforementioned officers was LT. COL. of the Office of Special Investigation. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan advised the Air Force personnel present of the portion of the evidence we had discovered at the crime scene and asked them for assistance in locating where this type of shoe was sold or issued. LT. COL. advised that his office would assist assigned investigators in attempting to locate the source of the shoe.\nOfficers were directed to the Base Supply with the assistance of Special Agent DONALD of O.S.I., at which time it was determined through Base Supply that this shoe in question was of Government issue and that it was not kept in stock at Base Supply, however it was believed that the Sales Store had such an item. It was then explained that if a military person or civilian employee was determined to be in need of such an item, he first reported to the Base Supply, at which time he was issued a purchase requisition which he in turn took to the Sales Store and the type of shoe was issued to the individual and they in turn required the individual to sign the purchase requisition showing that he did receive the item. This purchase requisition states the type of shoe that the individual was to receive, however makes no reference as to size.\nAssigned investigators, accompanied by Special Agent proceeded to the Sales Store located on Travis Air Force Base. After a short period of time R/Os located in stock a shoe fitting the identical description of the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast which officers had in their possession. The identical shoe with identical tread was found and a shoe bearing the closest measurements in the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast was measured and found to be a size 10 1/2 in military styling or a 10 1/2 D in civilian equivalent. It was determined through Air Force records that they were unable to furnish officers with the\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

Air Force records indicate this type shoe is manufactured by the International Shoe Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, then shipped to Air Force Depot, Ogden, Utah, and from there shipped to the various military installations upon requisition orders.\n10/1/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then proceeded to the Vallejo Police Department and met with Sgt. Jack Mullanax and Sgt. Duane Nilsson. Officers exchanged information regarding Vallejo's crime of 7/4/69 and our particular incident. Suspect information was exchanged and is listed in the separate suspect file.\nInvestigating Officers checked to determine the validity of the decoded message and as to how far the original cyphers had been decoded. It was then learned that the message had been decoded by at least two different sources, one being by MR. and MRS. HARDIN of Salinas and the other by the FBI in Washington. It was noted that these cyphers were broken independent of one another and the FBI confirmed the validity of the original decoded message. It was also learned that there was a small portion on the very end of the coded message that had not been decoded for reasons unknown.\nThe balance of the afternoon and evening Reporting Officers and other investigating officers met to exchange information and further discuss the evidence at hand.\nThursday, October 2nd, 1969, 0845 hours Reporting Officer Lonergan received a telephone call from Special Agent, OSI, Travis Air Force Base. Subject called to report that approximately 500 to 1,000 of that type of wing-walker shoe have been sold as surplus on the Base. This would be over and above those sold at the Sales Store. Agent further related he has the names of all the subjects who have purchased this item through surplus and will keep these names available to officers upon request.\nThe balance of the morning was spent searching fingerprint evidence and answering phone calls from possible witnesses.\nThursday, 10/2/69, 1400 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan attended the funeral services for victim CECELIA SHEPARD.

Lonergan and Narlow also attended the graveside services at the St. Helena Cemetery in St. Helena.\nFriday, 10/3/69 - Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Richard Lonergan contacted JAMES, Napa State Hospital, advised him to set up an interview with a patient who is a possible suspect in our case. The patient is identified as GRIFFIN RAYMOND FRANKLIN, WMA, 20 yrs. of age, DOB [blank], 6'2\"\", 223 lbs. [JAMES] had previously reported that this subject had left the hospital on a pass Friday evening, 9/26/69, and returned to the hospital Monday afternoon, 9/29/69. This subject also had spent time in the Air Force and was discharged from the Air Force in January 1969 for psychiatric problems. According to the doctors at the hospital, this subject was capable of committing this type of a crime. R/O in the presence of JAMES and Security Officer PHIL RYAN interviewed subject FRANKLIN. FRANKLIN was very cooperative and talkative to R/O and went over his activities the prior weekend. Briefly stated, MR. FRANKLIN, whose parents live in Vallejo, never left the Vallejo area that weekend and stayed around home talking with his mother, stepfather, and three brothers. After interviewing subject, it was the opinion of R/O Sgt. Lonergan that this subject was not the responsible. He had a definite very fast manner of speaking which was completely opposed to the victim's statement concerning the suspect's voice. R/O also contacted the mother of the suspect, a MRS. OPAL at Hollywood Avenue, Vallejo. MRS. OPAL stated more or less the exact same thing that her son had stated as to his whereabouts that weekend. It appears that this subject has a reliable alibi as to his activities and had no access to a vehicle that weekend.

While lying on the ground, victim HARTNELL stated he heard a noise and asked MISS SHEPARD if she could hear anything or see anything behind a tree not far from where the couple were lying. MISS SHEPARD told victim HARTNELL she could see a man behind the tree. HARTNELL asked her what he was doing. MISS SHEPARD stated she couldn't tell. HARTNELL stated he (suspect) then came from behind the tree. MISS SHEPARD said, \"\"Oh my God, he has a gun!\"\"\nVictim HARTNELL stated the man approached the couple, aiming a black steel automatic pistol. The suspect stated he needed a car and money.

Suspect did not take the wallet or victim's car keys.\nVictim stated a man in a pickup truck found him on the road and called an ambulance. Victim stated he estimated one hour in time was involved between the time he and MISS SHEPARD were stabbed until help arrived.\nMISS SHEPARD is listed in critical condition.\n\n-------\n\nTranscript\nPage 1\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-321-F9-5861\nSgt. ROBERTSON stated that Mr. HARTNELL was heavily sedated but was able to give a verbal statement pertaining to the attack at Lake Berrysessa. The interview was taped and reads as follows:\n\"\"INTERVIEW OF JOHN ROBERTSON, DET/SGT., NAPA COUNTY SHERIFF's DEPARTMENT, WITH BRYAN CALVIN HARTNELL (NSO CASE #105907) AT QUEEN OF THE VALLEY HOSPITAL ON SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1969 (TRANSCRIBED FROM TAPE RECORDING BY M. FEURLE):\n\"\"J.R. Can you give me this fellow's description and tell me what happened?\n\"\"B.H. So many people have been asking me... I hope...\n\"\"J.R. Well sometimes when we're repetitious, I know it happens to me, I tell the same thing over and over and over, and sometimes I might vary a little, and if you do...\n\"\"B.H. Shall I just start out and tell you what happened?\n\"\"J.R. I don't want to tire you out.\n\"\"B.H. I just don't want this to happen again to anybody... Of course he might have his reasons, I don't know...\n\"\"J.R. Okay. Go right ahead. Start right from the beginning. What happened?\n\"\"B.H. Okay. This girl came out from school, I used to go with her two years ago, and she's now going to another school, and she came up to visit some friends and we were having dinner at the school cafeteria, and I said, 'Well, are you doing anything special this afternoon?' and she said, 'Why?', and I said, 'I don't know. We could go out and either go for a walk, go to San Francisco, or, you know, just...', 'cause we used to be good friends. We used to have a good friendship. And so it got too late by the time we got around to what we were going to do. We had to stop in St. Helena for a couple items and then we had to cart a couple kids home and stuff, and by the time we finally got around to it, it was getting late, and I thought going to San Francisco 'd rush you, you know, because by the time we got back for worship... And so we went out to Berryessa, and there was this one place I used to go out... we used to all the time, you know... and I couldn't find it. And so I figured Ah, forget it, and this looks like as good a place as any. So I parked the car, there were no other cars there. I had a Kharman Ghia, '56, white, with a black vinyl top, and it's in pretty\nPage 2\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n... \"\"good-looking shape. But we parked there on the road's edge and we talked Oh it must be about a quarter of a mile to down to the place where we went. We had... (unintelligible) peninsula, it's an an island I guess during the wetter season, You can see where it was levee... And so that looked like a lot... there was a big spreading tree up there. There were two of them, really, one was a little bigger than the other. We took the one that was out on the point.\n\"\"It was really beautiful out there. We were sitting on top... I lay down on my back and she lay down on her stomach beside me, you know, kind of resting her head on my shoulder, and we were talking, you know, kind of reminiscing about old times, and stuff. And I heard these rustling leaves, and I said, 'You have your specs on. Why don't you see what the deal is over there?' And she says, 'Oh, it's some man.' And I said, 'Is he alone?' and she said, 'Yeah... (unintelligible)...' and she says, 'Well he just stepped behind the tree.' And I said, 'What's the idea of that? To take a leak?' You know, 'cause that's the only thing I could think of, just step behind a tree. And so I says, 'Well, keep looking and tell me what happens,' and she says, 'Oh my God, he's got a gun!' and squeezed my arm and\n\"\"And so he came out, and of course still actually I wasn't... There's some things you really wouldn't mind having happen, just for the experience of it. You know I thought, Well I only got fifty cents on me. It's worth all of that having it happen. I didn't think about another angle. So I talked to him, you know. I said, 'Well listen, Mac, (you know I'm in the sociologist field, you know, I'm pre-law, with history and psych.) You know I've read about the criminal mind and everything, you know. I thought well maybe the guy really does need help, you know. I says, 'There's no strings attached.' I says, 'I don't have any money right now but if you need help that badly I can help you out in another way maybe.' And he says, 'Nah.. time's running short,' he says, ''cause I just got out of... some prison in Montana, I don't know what the name of it is. Feathers? Do you know what the name of it is? I'll see if it sounds familiar. Fern or Feathers? It's some double name, like Fern Lock or something...\n\"\"J.R. It's Lodge..\nPage 3\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. Oh yeah, yeah, Lodge. At least we know we're together on that.\n\"\"J.R. Mountain Lodge Prison, or something of that nature...\n\"\"B.H. Yeah. You know he said he broke out and had to kill a guard getting out. And I said, 'Well, man, I mean actually I don't mean to call your bluff or anything, but wouldn't you rather be stuck on a stealing charge than a threat of homicide?' you know? And he says, 'Well just don't start playing hero on me.' You know, 'Don't try to grab the gun,' 'cause I didn't really figure the gun was loaded. I always thought it would be empty. I've heard a lot of times that this is what they do just as a bluff, but I decided not to call his bluff after he really, you know... I told him, 'You know you're really wasting your time with me. I've got a billfold and this much change and that's it.' And he said, he told the girl, 'Go tie him up. I'd feel much better if you were tied up.' And she tied a couple of loose knots on me, so I made it look kind of tight... (unintelligible)... you know, just for a second, and he said 'Go ahead.' And I whispered to her, 'You know I think I can get that gun.' And I said, 'Do you mind?' and she got kind of fearful about it, so I figured since there's two lives involved, not just mine, I won't do it.\n\"\"So I let her tie me up on the wrists again, and he tied her up, - terribly tight, you know, real... (unintelligible) ... put his gun away, and we were talking and all, bantering, you know, basically. I was thinking, anything I can do to help, by the way just to keep the conversation going... Suddenly he was taking it all seriously, you know... So I was starting out and finally he said, 'Okay, lay down. I've got her tied up', you know... He strung a rope between our ankles in the rear, so we were like this, you know, on our stomachs, tied...\n\"\"J.R. You both facing the ground...\n\"\"B.H. Right. And, oh, this was before. I got sort of ahead. So anyway, he said, 'Get down,' and I said, 'Oh come on! We could freeze to death!' I said that a couple, three times, and he said, 'GET DOWN! RIGHT NOW!' He got a little pushed off at me. So I got down and then he finished tying her up and clonked her down, - and then he goes... Sswhooosh (a sound with his mouth)... (unintelligible)\nPage 4\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"And so I said, 'Do you have bullets in there?' And so he pulled out the clip and showed me that he did. The bullets were about this long, I can remember, and about this fat, and they had the regular red cap on it, about this long. Maybe that doesn't give you any better description of the gun or not. I don't know. And it came out of the heel, the grip, you know. It slipped out from the bottom.\n\"\"And now, to backtrack a bit. I was really trying to see what he looked like, you know. He had on pleated pants, these old type of suit pants, you know, and they were either black or dark blue, I can't remember now. And I can't remember what he was wearing for shoes. But he had on this cotton coat, You've seen the kind, that you just turn the collar up once, there's a zipper down the front, you know. They're real light, super-thin, you know...\n\"\"J.R. Kind of a windbreaker...\n\"\"B.H. Yeah, like a windbreaker. And it's got this blue, this little collar, sometimes the guys wear them standing up, you know.\n\"\"J.R. What color was that?\n\"\"B.H. That was dark blue. And I don't know. Maybe he had something in his pouch. I just took it as being a... as being a... you know, he was stout 'cause he looked kind of heavy. I think he was weighing two and a quarter, two fifty, somewhere in there. And I got kind of a look at his hair. His voice... I can remember... almost like I'd heard it before. You know there's some drawls that a lot of people have similar. And... almost as if I'd heard it before... couldn't think where.\n\"\"I gave that one up, I just gave it up on that angle. I looked through his hair. I kind of looked like it was combed, you know, like this.. it was a brownish, you know, dark brown hair.\n\"\"And this mask he had on. It was ingeniously devised. It was... he had four corners at the top, like the top of a paper sack... black. It came down, came down, with the front panel about to here, and a kind of a thing that came over the shoulders, you know, and then the same thing down the back, straight down. And in the front he had a circle with a symmetrical cross in the middle. You know what I mean by a symmetrical cross?\nPage 5\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. Um hum (affirmative).\n\"\"B.H. The ends of the cross hung out about this far on each of the... you know, where it came out. The circle was this much... like this... and then it was like this, you see... hung out on the end, over the edge of the circle.\n\"\"And he had clip-on sunglasses... it was hard to tell. You know, the sunglasses you clip on when you're wearing glasses, eyeglasses, He had those clipped on. I'm pretty sure... I don't think he had glasses, though. I think he just had these clipped on to his suit... you know, that little mask.\n\"\"And I don't know how tall he was. Maybe 5-8 or maybe 5-10, 6 feet, somewhere in there. I'm a very poor judge of height because of my height. I have no meaning, you know. It's always down, you know. It can never be up...\n\"\"And so I saw him put away his gun, and I was turning to say something to Celia, and all of a sudden I felt my back... just... no, I think I saw him pull it out.. I don't remember... I think I saw him whip out his knife and just start stabbing me in the back... CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP! I was just (makes a gutteral sound)... you know that kind of a sound... and Celia turned to see why I was (repeats gutteral sound), you know, and she just about fainted. She went hysterical... (unintelligible) ... and when he finally stopped... I mean he went over and... The doctor says there's six in the back, six wounds on my back. You ought to confirm that. One I've got went clear through the lung. I've got it draining. I did drain a couple pints of blood out as soon as I got here. I lost an awful lot of blood, I guess.\n\"\"We were down... I mean it was absolutely no question in my mind... when a person gets stabbed as many times as we did... we were going to die. I mean there'd be no reason to question it. But somehow I, you know, started (unintelligible)... I just knew there was too much I had to live for. I mean really it does happen... about getting depressed and everything... when you're young you always think about these things... you know you think about it... and when you've got someone forcing your hand, oh well, there was a lot of things I had to do. And what really kept me going... you know my parents are pretty Christian. I haven't been too much of a Christian myself... but if you believe in the principle you ask God to help you. Another thing, What was my only strength was knowing two things. One, that I did not want to die, and two, that I felt that whatever was\nPage 6\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n\"\"going to be was going to be, but I was going to try my damnedest to stay alive. And so, like I say, - before I left her I kissed her, and I said, 'Well,' I says, 'I'm gonna try to get help.'\n\"\"There was a boat kept circling around out there in the lake and we started yelling at it and finally it came within about 100 yards of the shore and turned off its motor and stayed there watching us for about fifteen minutes, and we were just screaming hysterically, trying to get their attention, you know, to come over here. Oh, I don't know, I guess they were afraid that the guy might be there in the bushes and they were liable to get choked or something. So finally he came up a little closer. I didn't have my glasses on... I was just swaying, you know... and I had gotten one of her hands free before they came, and so I kept trying to get her to untie me, and she couldn't, she was too weak, she said.\n\"\"So finally I just kept hollering and hollering, and she said, 'Turn around and let's see if I can do it again.' She finally got it. My hands and my feet were just pure numbness... they're still numb but I'm sure that will go 'way. But I finally got... (unintelligible)... untie her so she could kind of relax out. 'Cause it was a terrible position, you know, upon our stomachs... (unintelligible)...\n\"\"And so I started to go for help. I finally got myself fairly reconciled. I wasn't too worried about dying, if that was what was going to happen, but I knew I had to keep pushing on. I had to force myself into staying alive because it was... I could just see myself... you know, all sort of waves would come over... I just (coughing sound)... (unintelligible)... 'Well, you're not gonna give up this easy', you know. And, like I say, I just kept believing that God would do everything the best, if the thing was gonna happen, but I couldn't see any reason why my dying would be the best good. So I just played along with that.\n\"\"I just started to walk toward the road... everything blacked out on me... my visual... my mind was never blacked out, but my visual was. So I lay down... My eyes started to come open... I just saw a haze of trees, you know. In a little while I got up and went another twenty feet, and then the same thing happened... (unintelligible)... and sat down. Next thing I went clear... (unintelligible)... the road, and by that time I just fell... I just... I was trying so hard to go far I just went too far. Finally I heard this pickup\nPage 7\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"coming... I was just laying alongside the road, and that's where this guy picked me up.\n\"\"They weren't in any hurry at all, it didn't seem like, you know, but they finally called an ambulance. About fifteen minutes later it came... (unintelligible)... but I still believe... I've got feeling... starting to get a little pain to come through. But from the minute that knife blade went in, it was nothing but pure shock from there on. I just did not expect it. I didn't expect that he would do that. That was a variable I had completely left out. And I guess he just took off running after we started running. I don't know. I never saw him before and hope not to see him again... at least outside of a courtroom.\n\"\"It's hard for me to explain much more. I mean I'm trying to give you a kind of example of his technique. He had some rope cut up in his back pocket. And he had a ... well, I thought it was a police automatic because it was in one of these black leather cases, you know...\n\"\"J.R. Was it in a smooth case, or did it have a basket weave like..\n\"\"B.H. Can I have my glasses? Oh, they're not here. It was a smooth one, though.\n\"\"J.R. Did he have this hood down to about the middle of his chest?\n\"\"B.H. No, about like... well, I'll show you... Here... his stomach.. You know I could see his... (voice fades away)\n\"\"J.R. Okay. You said his hair looked dark brown. How could you see his hair?\n\"\"B.H. 'Cause I saw it from where those goggles fit. I looked so closely to find out. And when he turned you know they kind of flittered... I could see his hair. It looked kind of greasy.\n\"\"J.R. Now was he as heavy as I am?\n\"\"B.H. Well I can't say 'cause he wasn't wearing those type of clothes. They were sloppy clothes, you know. And he just had on this old pair of pleated pants. I don't know... How tall are you?\n\"\"J.R. I'm about five eleven.\nPage 8\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. Well, like I say, he was dressed kind of sloppily, you know. His pants real tight up here and his stomach kind of pouched a bit, you know. I don't know... it's hard to say 'cause I can't judge you with being in a suit and all, you know, and him not being professional-looking at all. He could be about the same. It's hard to say. He was so sloppily dressed.\n\"\"J.R. Bryan, you also mentioned a drawl. Well not a drawl, an accent.\n\"\"B.H. It was just something... I guess his way of talking. It was something I couldn't repeat. It's like a song. Sometimes you know what you're going to say but you just can't sing the melody worth a darn.\n\"\"J.R. Did he have a throaty voice or a high pitched?\n\"\"B.H. In between. But it was just a unique way of talking.\n\"\"J.R. Did he sound like an educated man?\n\"\"B.H. Heck no! I don't think so.\n\"\"J.R. Did he sound illiterate?\n\"\"B.H. No. He didn't sound that way either. He just impressed me as being rather low class. The reason was because of his clothes, you know.\n\"\"J.R. Did you lose consciousness when he stabbed you at any time? Did you observe him stab Cecelia?\n\"\"B.H. Yeah...\n\"\"J.R. What did he say after...\n\"\"B.H. He stabbed her a bunch of times in the back. After she turned around, he got her once in the groin and one in the arm I think. He kind of went a little more hog-wild with her than with me. I faked dead... like that... I didn't want him to come back and give me some more.\n\"\"J.R. So you were pretty sure he thought you were dead when he finished working on you?\nPage 9\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. I think he kind of thought that. Of course I don't know because we started talking right after he left. It's hard to say... (unintelligible)... I don't think she fainted either.\n\"\"J.R. Was she in a lot of pain, did she tell you?\n\"\"B.H. Oh yeah. She was more weak at the time... (unintelligible).. from the religious angle. I told her I sure as heck wasn't going to have any deathbed conversion. 'No,' she says... (unintelligible)... I mean it was just like you were gonna die and had a few things to say. But I felt more and more I wasn't losing strength as much... (unintelligible)... that I thought I could cope with...\n\"\"J.R. What you did was a courageous thing. It was a terrible thing to have happen to anyone.\n\"\"B.H. Well there was nothing we could do. We were kind of at the mercy of him. I mean I wanted to get that gun... (unintelligible)... There was a time I think I could have gotten it...\n\"\"J.R. Did it appear to be a .45 to you? An automatic?\n\"\"B.H. It was about this long... along the stock... and had a wood edge on it, you know.. on either side...\n\"\"J.R. Handles.\n\"\"B.H. Yeah...yeah...\n\"\"J.R. Did the bullet look anything like that?\n\"\"B.H. No. It was kind of like this, only it was gold, and this part here came out along with this and then round the gold, round the blunt end. Not quite that blunt-ended, though.\n\"\"J.R. Was it fat? Fatter than this?\n\"\"B.H. Yeah, I think it was a little fatter. But it was gold, you know. And I didn't see any of this here. There was a part where it crimped... Well, almost like that 22, short, only a lot bigger. It was about like this length, maybe more stubby.\nPage 10\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n\"\"J.R. Well I'll get a .45 a little later and we can bring it up and let you observe it.\n\"\"B.H. \"\"Let's take the suspect. His hands... I don't remember if they had gloves on or not. I can't remember now. I keep thinking that he had gloves on. I can't figure how he tied us... Let's ask Celia, she probably knows about that.\n\"\"J.R. Did he swear? Did he use any profane language or obscenity?\n\"\"B.H. I don't think so. If he did it was no more than I was using at the time. I don't think he used any obscenity. He might have used a swear word or something, you know. That wasn't striking to me...\n\"\"J.R. Do you have any idea what his motive might have been? Money?\n\"\"B.H. Money. He said he was going to go to Mexico and he was flat broke.\n\"\"J.R. Did he search you after he...\n\"\"B.H. Heck no! Very unprofessional. He didn't even end up taking that loose change and didn't even take my billfold.\n\"\"J.R. Why did he stab you when you weren't fighting him off or anything?\n\"\"B.H. I couldn't. Even if I'd have wanted to. I was laying on my stomach...\n\"\"J.R. So what would have been the purpose of him to stab you, do you think?\n\"\"B.H. Well I (unintelligible)...but I think he got rattled... (unintelligible)... very, very nervous. His hands were shaking... (unintelligible)... Are you nervous?\n\"\"J.R. I'm just curious. If you could write me that symbol you were telling me about. Do you think you could draw me a picture of that even without your glasses?\n\"\"B.H. Um hum (affirmative). (Draws)... kind of like that. I can't see very well...\nPage 11\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. Yes, I see. Okay...\n\"\"B.H. ... (unintelligible)... that I could really die...\n\"\"J.R. Does this ring a bell?\n\"\"B.H. This one here. This is more like it, but I'm not sure. It was distinctly that design. It was thick. More thick marks.\n\"\"J.R. Okay. What color was this? Do you recall?\n\"\"B.H. Black. And that was white.\n\"\"J.R. This was black.\n\"\"B.H. No, that was white. It was about this tall.\n\"\"J.R. Two and a half, three inches?\n\"\"B.H. About four by four... three by three...\n\"\"J.R. How do you feel? Am I tiring you out too much?\n\"\"B.H. No. I've had a couple shots. It's not hurting me at all.\n\"\"J.R. Do you think Cecelia could tell me any more than you have already told me? Add anything?\n\"\"B.H. (unintelligible)\n\"\"J.R. Did he slap you around? Slap her?\n\"\"B.H. (unintelligible)... No.\n\"\"J.R. He was a much smaller man than you?\n\"\"B.H. Not much. About your height I guess. I don't know.\n\"\"J.R. Well you're getting kind of sleepy. I'll ease up on you.\n\"\"B.H. Have you gotten any clues at all?\n\"\"J.R. Yes, we've got some good clues. Before we get this guy it's going to take a lot of work.\n\"\"B.H. Remember he said he was headed for Mexico,\nPage 12\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. He's headed for Mexico?\n\"\"B.H. That's what he said.\n\"\"J.R. I'll leave you my card. It's right up here. I'm going to go down and talk to your mom and dad.\n\"\"B.H. Have the news heard about this at all?\n\"\"J.R. Yes.\n\"\"B.H. Was there anything in the paper today?\n\"\"J.R. No, it wasn't in...\n\"\"B.H. The Napa paper?\n\"\"J.R. Well there's no Napa paper on Sundays. It's been on the news media...\n\"\"B.H. Names? Did they name my name?\n\"\"J.R. I don't know, to tell you the truth.\n\"\"B.H. The reason I asked is my girl friend lives in Portland and I've got to talk to her before it gets to her...\n\"\"J.R. Okay\n\"\"B.H. What time is it now?\n\"\"J.R. It's one o'clock\n\"\"B.H. What are the rates now?\n\"\"J.R. Don't you worry about the rates.\n\"\"B.H. Well I should probably give her a call...\n\"\"J.R. You're looking real good. You've got some color...\n\"\"B.H. Is there a phone real close by?\n\"\"J.R. I'll get the nurse...\n\"\"B.H.

RONALD FONG advised him that he had seen a male and a female victim on the beach area south of Rancho Monticello Resort, hollering that they had been stabbed. Ranger Sgt. White, accompanied by ARCHIE WHITE, ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the beach area via speedboat owned by ARCHIE WHITE. When they arrived on the beach they observed a young female lying on the ground with what appeared to be numerous stab wounds. Ranger Sgt. White stated that the female appeared to be in a great deal of pain. White stated as they discovered the female victim, Ranger Dennis Land arrived at the scene in his pickup truck, carrying a male victim who also appeared to have numerous stab wounds. White stated he immediately radioed in and had Park Headquarters call the Sheriff's Office to dispatch an ambulance and a Deputy. White stated he attempted to interview both the boy and girl victims while awaiting arrival of the ambulance. According to White, the male victim said that a male subject approached them, wearing a hood, dressed in dark clothing. The subject was carrying what appeared to be an automatic pistol and stated that he wanted their money and car keys. According to White, the male victim related to him that the subject advised him he was an ex-con out of Colorado and was en route to Mexico. Suspect stated he had to tie them up, and after they were tied the responsible stated, \"\"I'm going to have to stab you.\"\" White further related that the male victim advised the responsible, \"\"Stab me first, I can't stand to see her stabbed first.\"\" The male victim then advised that the responsible stabbed him numerous times in the back and then stabbed the girl.\nThe female victim advised White that she could not see the responsible's face as a hood was covering all of his head. She also advised White that the suspect had what appeared to be clip-on sunglasses to cover his eyes. Ranger Sgt. White stated that this is the most he could get out of either victim as they were both in great shock and pain. White stated that he noticed a lot of blood near the girl's groin area. The interview with Ranger Sgt. White was terminated at that point.\n\",,\"recaQva0MW8dTOkOW,rec0sRHJ9eLbQJYsJ\",,,,,,1969,September,Saturday,recmQK2TtG43z2t8t,Case Event,1969-09-27T18:55:00.000Z,9/27/1969 6:55PM,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=William%20White%20told%20to%20respond%20to%20stabbing&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=William%20White%20told%20to%20respond%20to%20stabbing&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2025-09-28T02:57:22.000Z,6:55 PM,,1969-09-27T18:55:00.000Z,,,2,0,0,,,\"William White, Rancho Monticello Resort\",,Fact,,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"errorType\"\": \"\"emptyDependency\"\", \"\"isStale\"\": false, \"\"state\"\": \"\"error\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2026-02-16T21:16:21.000Z,true,Lake Berryessa,william-white-told-to-respond-to-stabbing,125,rec1WiCt1FaTRIEch,699389246123db17aa8be466,,,\nrecHQgFcpJHyKIHTf,Narlow and Lonergan interview Rancho Monticello witnesses,1969-09-28,50400,rec98vjxVJgVVbh1X,\"9/28/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort and interviewed MR.

WHITE stated the girl advised him, \"\"He was a man with a hood... His face was covered... He was wearing black pants... It hurts, it hurts.\"\" MRS. WHITE then advised after the female had regained her composure, she told her the man had asked for money but didn't take any. She said she hadn't been raped. MRS. WHITE further advised that the female victim told her that the responsible was wearing glasses, with dark clip-on sunglasses over the hood. She told her that the responsible had a black pistol. MR. ARCHIE WHITE stated he overheard the male victim advise someone that the responsible was wearing gloves. MR. and MRS. WHITE further advised that this is the only information either victim gave them on the responsible, and that they spent the balance of the time attempting to make the victim more comfortable until the arrival of the ambulance.\nAfter the interview with MR. and MRS.

BYRD advised that MISS JUDY was a student at the college and had left the college earlier in the afternoon, driving a yellow Datsun. At 2135 hours Reporting Officers put out an All Points Bulletin around the City and County of Napa for this above described vehicle. At 2137 hours Officers received permission to interview the victim BRYAN HARTNELL who was taken to the X-Ray Room for x-rays. Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Lonergan attempted to interview BRYAN HARTNELL while in the presence of DONALD JUDAH and hospital attendant CLIFFORD MEAGHER. Sgt. Narlow was called away to answer a phone before the interview got under way. HARTNELL appeared to be in extreme pain and also appeared to be in shock. Reporting Officer Lonergan introduced himself to HARTNELL and asked him to give us any information he had on his assailant. HARTNELL stated that the assailant was wearing a black ceremonial type hood, square on top, and appeared to be heavy-set, between 200 and 250 pounds. He also stated his assailant had approached both him and MISS SHEPARD with a gun but had stabbed them with a long knife. HARTNELL further stated the gun was in a black holster and the knife was in a sheath. He stated that the attacker was wearing dark clothing, dark jacket and dark pants. HARTNELL further stated that the gun was an automatic pistol and the knife had a black handle and appeared to be homemade.\nIt should be noted that HARTNELL was very groggy and he was very difficult to interview at that time. Subject was re-interviewed the next day by Det/Sgt. Robertson and gave more complete details. (The report of Sgt. Robertson's interview is attached.)\nAt 2215 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan left the Queen of the Valley Hospital after advising Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and William Munk to take charge of the clothing of the victims and any other evidence from the victims when it was released from the hospital. Munk and Brambrink were also advised to stand by at the hospital as a security measure until other arrangements could be made.\nAs Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan were arriving at the Napa County Sheriff's Office, they were advised by the Napa Police Department that they had located MISS JUDY in the downtown Napa area and were bringing her to the Napa County Sheriff's Office. MISS [JUDY] was interviewed by Lonergan and Narlow at the Napa County Sheriff's Office. She was further identified as MISS JUDITH, a student at Pacific Union College, with a permanent residence address of Sun Valley, California. MISS [JUDITH] advised that she was with BRYAN\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

She stated that they all left Pacific Union College together at approximately 1:00 P.M. and went to a rummage sale in the City of St. Helena. She stated that BRYAN had bought a T.V. set at the rummage sale and had to transport it back to his room at Pacific Union College. She stated he left CECELIA at the rummage sale as there was not enough room in his car. MISS [JUDITH] stated BRYAN returned to the St. Helena area and picked up CECELIA at approximately 2:00 P.M. MISS [JUDITH] stated as far as she knew, both BRYAN and CECELIA were planning to go to San Francisco when they left her in St. Helena. MISS [JUDITH] stated she had no knowledge of any plans that BRYAN and CECELIA were making to go to the Lake Berryessa area. MISS [JUDITH] stated the last time she saw BRYAN and CECELIA was approximately 2:00 P.M. in the afternoon.\nThe interview with MISS [JUDITH] was terminated at that point.\nDet/Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow then proceeded to Lake Berryessa and arrived at the scene of the crime, which was approximately a mile and a half north of Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters, at 2354 hours. The scene was being preserved by uniformed officers and under the direct control of Deputy Sheriffs David Collins and Ray Land. The investigating officers were briefed by Officers Collins and Land as to what had taken place prior to our arrival. Officers observed a 1956 white Kharman Ghia with a black vinyl top, Oregon license plate 4 U 2040. Investigating officers were shown footprints in dirt area and tire tracks, both believed to have been left by responsible. Investigating officers awaited the arrival of Sgt. Tom Butler who had been called to take photographs of the crime scene area and Sgt. Hal Snook, criminalist for collection and preservation of physical evidence. R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were advised by Park Ranger Dennis Land who had also arrived at the scene that it was possible to get to the beach area by vehicle from a locked gate approximately one-half mile south of the victim's vehicle. Officers proceeded to the area and arrived at the footpath approximately halfway between the scene of the crime at the beach and the victim's vehicle on the road. At that point, after a brief examination of the footpath area, officers discovered a similar footprint on the footpath to that found at the scene of the victim's vehicle. At that point, due to the lateness and darkness of the hour, Reporting Officers decided to completely secure the area and make a thorough search of the scene at first light. Officers then exited the crime scene area in the same manner and locked the aforementioned gate leading to this vicinity. Investigating officers along with Park Ranger Dennis Land went to the Berryessa Park Headquarters.\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

These items consisted of a blanket, a pair of man's shoes, a wallet belonging to BRYAN HARTNELL, eyeglasses, and playing cards. Among the various aforementioned items believed to belong to the victims, were numerous strands of white plastic line cut into various assorted lengths, some of which had what appeared to be bloodstains. These items were subsequently turned over to Det/Sgt. Hal Snook for preservation.\nAssigned investigators then proceeded back to the scene where the victim's car was parked and assisted Sgt. Snook in the making of the plaster casts. At approximately 0245 hours Sgt. Lonergan, having previously obtained the keys to the vehicle from BRYAN HARTNELL's property at Queen of the Valley Hospital, drove the white Kharman Ghia to the maintenance shop at Berryessa Park Headquarters. The vehicle was parked inside of the maintenance shop building and the building was secured for the evening by investigating officers with the assistance of Park Ranger Dennis Land. Assigned Investigators then returned back to the scene where the victim's vehicle had been previously parked and awaited the arrival of Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and Mel Fechter who were assigned to security duty in the crime scene area. At approximately 0300 hours officers assumed their duties at the crime scene area and the security was placed under the direction of Deputy Allen Brambrink. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then returned to their respective residences with plans to continue the investigation at daybreak.\n9/28/69 0700 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene at Lake Berryessa area, accompanied by Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Capt. Donald Townsend, and Sgt. James Munk. Officers then assisted Det/Sgt. Snook in tracking the footprints from the vehicle to the scene of the crime by the beach area. (The location and preservation of aforementioned footprints will be detailed in a supplementary evidence report by Sgt. Snook.)\nAt 0800 hours Reporting Officers Lonergan and Narlow received information via Park Headquarters that a DR. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his son would like to talk to them at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop regarding a possible suspect in this crime. At 0912 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan contacted DR. R. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his 16-yr. old son DAVID LEE RAYFIELD at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop. DR. RAYFIELD gave a home address of Los Gatos, California. DR. RAYFIELD stated that about 6:30 P.M. the previous evening he and his son had parked their car north of Park Headquarters in the general area of the\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts.

They stated they went down towards the beach area when DAVID RAYFIELD noticed a white male adult subject walking in the area, described as about 5'10\"\", heavy build, wearing dark trousers, a dark shirt with red in it, long sleeves. He stated this subject was carrying nothing in his hands and was apparently just walking alongside the hill area about halfway between the road and the lake. DAVID further stated that when the subject observed him he turned around and walked up the hill in a southerly direction. DR. RAYFIELD and his son stated that they did not notice a vehicle in the area of their vehicle and only this subject at a distance of about 100 yards. They also advised there was a man with two young boys in the area shooting B-B guns, but they did not know if this man saw the subject or not. This location was approximately 8/10ths of a mile from the scene of the victim's vehicle. In the opinion of R/Os, it is unlikely, unless this male subject had a vehicle in the immediate area, he could have traversed the area to the scene of the crime on foot. There are four coves of water between the scene of the crime and the area where the doctor saw the subject. The interview with DR. RAYFIELD and his son was terminated at that point.\nAt 1000 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene of the crime and further assisted Sgt. Snook in the collecting and locating of evidence.\nAt 1320 hours 9/28/69, R/Os interviewed Ranger Sgt. William White at Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters. White was interviewed as to his activities before and during his part in locating the victims the night before. White stated at approximately 1855 hours 9/27/69 he was on routine patrol around the Lake Berryessa area when he received a call from Park Headquarters to proceed to the Rancho Monticello Resort where a person was reporting a possible stabbing. \nWhite stated he proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort where he was contacted by ARCHIE E. WHITE, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG. RONALD FONG advised him that he had seen a male and a female victim on the beach area south of Rancho Monticello Resort, hollering that they had been stabbed. Ranger Sgt. White, accompanied by ARCHIE WHITE, ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the beach area via speedboat owned by ARCHIE WHITE.

According to White, the male victim said that a male subject approached them, wearing a hood, dressed in dark clothing. The subject was carrying what appeared to be an automatic pistol and stated that he wanted their money and car keys. According to White, the male victim related to him that the subject advised him he was an ex-con out of Colorado and was en route to Mexico. Suspect stated he had to tie them up, and after they were tied the responsible stated, \"\"I'm going to have to stab you.\"\" White further related that the male victim advised the responsible, \"\"Stab me first, I can't stand to see her stabbed first.\"\" The male victim then advised that the responsible stabbed him numerous times in the back and then stabbed the girl.\nThe female victim advised White that she could not see the responsible's face as a hood was covering all of his head. She also advised White that the suspect had what appeared to be clip-on sunglasses to cover his eyes. Ranger Sgt. White stated that this is the most he could get out of either victim as they were both in great shock and pain. White stated that he noticed a lot of blood near the girl's groin area. The interview with Ranger Sgt. White was terminated at that point.\n9/28/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort and interviewed MR. ARCHIE E. WHITE. (It should be noted that ARCHIE E. WHITE and ELIZABETH WHITE are no relation to Ranger Sgt. White.) ARCHIE E. WHITE is the owner of the Boat Repair Shop at Rancho Monticello Resort.

WHITE further advised that the female victim told her that the responsible was wearing glasses, with dark clip-on sunglasses over the hood. She told her that the responsible had a black pistol. MR. ARCHIE WHITE stated he overheard the male victim advise someone that the responsible was wearing gloves. MR. and MRS. WHITE further advised that this is the only information either victim gave them on the responsible, and that they spent the balance of the time attempting to make the victim more comfortable until the arrival of the ambulance.\nAfter the interview with MR. and MRS. WHITE, Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan returned to the Napa County Sheriff's Office.\nAt 1620 hours R/O Det/Sgt. Narlow was contacted by a DEAN of the Pacific Union College in Angwin. DEAN advised that three young ladies, students at the college, might possibly have information as to a suspect in the attack at Lake Berryessa. The young ladies were identified as MISS JOANNE, MISS LINDA, and MISS LINDA.

MISS [JOANNE] advised R/O that on 9/27/69 at approximately 5:30 P.M. she and her two girlfriends parked their vehicle at a location two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. When they left their car they noticed a subject driving a late model silver blue Chevrolet, 2-door sedan, pull up behind them. What appeared to be a white male adult was sitting in the vehicle. They did not observe this subject leave the vehicle. The girls proceeded to the beach area and were sunbathing in their bikinis. After approximately one-half hour had passed, they observed what appeared to be the same subject standing within 40 or 50 feet of them, apparently observing them. This subject was described as 6' tall, weighing 200/210 lbs., muscular build, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing dark pants and a dark pullover shirt. The subject would stare at the three girls but when they looked up at him he would look away. The subject hung around the area for approximately 45 minutes and then the girls observed him walk up the hill. MISS [JOANNE] stated it was very doubtful that from his vantage point in the vehicle the subject could observe the three girls on the beach. She believes he waited in his vehicle and then followed them down after they were on the beach. MISS [JOANNE] further described the car as appearing very conservative. She stated the car did not appear to belong to any young person such as a teenager. She did state the car had California license plates but did not notice the number.\nThe other two young ladies, MISS [LINDA] and MISS [LINDA] were interviewed by Sgt. Snook and Capt.

Subject was described by MISS [LINDA] as approximately 28 years of age, 6' to 6'2\"\" tall, 200/225 lbs., black hair possibly styled, with a part on left, rounded eyes, thin lips, medium nose, straight eyebrows, small ears, well built, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing a black short-sleeved sweater shirt, bunched up in front, and a white tee shirt hanging out in back, and dark trousers. The three girls left the area about 4:30 P.M. and the subject's vehicle was gone. Witnesses did not observe the subject either leave or get back into his vehicle.\nMISS LINDA LEE was interviewed by R/O Capt. Donald Townsend. MISS [LINDA LEE] is a WFA, DOB [blank], address Howell Mountain Road, Angwin. MISS [LINDA LEE] is employed as a secretary of the college press. MISS [LINDA LEE] observed the same vehicle which was described as a late model Chevrolet, sky blue in color. The rear tail lights appeared to be long rather than round. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated they parked their vehicle at approximately 2:55 P.M. and observed the subject in his vehicle at that location. The girls proceeded to the beach and she, MISS [LINDA LEE], again noticed the subject about 30 to 45 minutes after they were at the beach. She noticed him standing on the bank approximately 45 yards from her location. She described the subject as 6 feet tall, stocky build, about 200 lbs., black short-sleeved sweater shirt, dark blue slacks, and straight dark hair neatly combed. She guessed his age at approximately 30 years. Subject had medium color skin and was not wearing glasses. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated she thought she saw a white belt around his back but it possibly was a tee shirt hanging out. She further stated that the man was fairly nice-looking, with a round face. She did not observe the subject leave the area in his vehicle.\n9/29/69 - 1600 hours Reporting Officers Sgt. Narlow and Sgt. Lonergan were advised by Capt.

He described these boots as being Government issue, issued to all Air Force personnel at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. They are primarily designed as a wing-walker shoe, however according to MR. [BASSEL] most Air Force personnel and many of the civilian personnel employed at Air Force bases had this type of shoe. The sole design of this shoe exactly matched the plaster cast design that Sgt. Snook had taken at the scene of the crime. It should be noted that Det/Sgt John Robertson had attempted to find a similar shoe design at the local shoe stores in the Napa area with negative results. (Refer Sgt. Robertson's supplementary report.) MR. [BASSEL] was asked if we could keep his shoes for identification purposes and he agreed. R/Os was also advised that this information regarding the type of footprint had not been released to the press or general public. MR.

Kenneth Narlow contacted CAPT. at Travis Air Force Base and arranged for an interview with COL. and SGT. to take place on Wednesday morning, October 1st, 1969, at 9:00 A.M. R/Os wanted to talk to someone at Travis regarding the shoeprints that were found on the scene. The remainder of the day and evening was spent in answering phone calls from people who had possible knowledge of the crime.\nWednesday, 10/1/69 - 0900 hours Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow went to Travis Air Force Base and were present at an interview in Col. office, who is Commanding Officer in charge of base security. Also present at this meeting besides the aforementioned officers was LT. COL. of the Office of Special Investigation. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan advised the Air Force personnel present of the portion of the evidence we had discovered at the crime scene and asked them for assistance in locating where this type of shoe was sold or issued. LT. COL. advised that his office would assist assigned investigators in attempting to locate the source of the shoe.\nOfficers were directed to the Base Supply with the assistance of Special Agent DONALD of O.S.I., at which time it was determined through Base Supply that this shoe in question was of Government issue and that it was not kept in stock at Base Supply, however it was believed that the Sales Store had such an item. It was then explained that if a military person or civilian employee was determined to be in need of such an item, he first reported to the Base Supply, at which time he was issued a purchase requisition which he in turn took to the Sales Store and the type of shoe was issued to the individual and they in turn required the individual to sign the purchase requisition showing that he did receive the item. This purchase requisition states the type of shoe that the individual was to receive, however makes no reference as to size.\nAssigned investigators, accompanied by Special Agent proceeded to the Sales Store located on Travis Air Force Base. After a short period of time R/Os located in stock a shoe fitting the identical description of the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast which officers had in their possession. The identical shoe with identical tread was found and a shoe bearing the closest measurements in the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast was measured and found to be a size 10 1/2 in military styling or a 10 1/2 D in civilian equivalent. It was determined through Air Force records that they were unable to furnish officers with the\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan\n- TYPED BY: M.

Air Force records indicate this type shoe is manufactured by the International Shoe Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, then shipped to Air Force Depot, Ogden, Utah, and from there shipped to the various military installations upon requisition orders.\n10/1/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then proceeded to the Vallejo Police Department and met with Sgt. Jack Mullanax and Sgt. Duane Nilsson. Officers exchanged information regarding Vallejo's crime of 7/4/69 and our particular incident. Suspect information was exchanged and is listed in the separate suspect file.\nInvestigating Officers checked to determine the validity of the decoded message and as to how far the original cyphers had been decoded. It was then learned that the message had been decoded by at least two different sources, one being by MR. and MRS. HARDIN of Salinas and the other by the FBI in Washington. It was noted that these cyphers were broken independent of one another and the FBI confirmed the validity of the original decoded message. It was also learned that there was a small portion on the very end of the coded message that had not been decoded for reasons unknown.\nThe balance of the afternoon and evening Reporting Officers and other investigating officers met to exchange information and further discuss the evidence at hand.\nThursday, October 2nd, 1969, 0845 hours Reporting Officer Lonergan received a telephone call from Special Agent, OSI, Travis Air Force Base.

Agent further related he has the names of all the subjects who have purchased this item through surplus and will keep these names available to officers upon request.\nThe balance of the morning was spent searching fingerprint evidence and answering phone calls from possible witnesses.\nThursday, 10/2/69, 1400 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan attended the funeral services for victim CECELIA SHEPARD.

The patient is identified as GRIFFIN RAYMOND FRANKLIN, WMA, 20 yrs. of age, DOB [blank], 6'2\"\", 223 lbs. [JAMES] had previously reported that this subject had left the hospital on a pass Friday evening, 9/26/69, and returned to the hospital Monday afternoon, 9/29/69. This subject also had spent time in the Air Force and was discharged from the Air Force in January 1969 for psychiatric problems. According to the doctors at the hospital, this subject was capable of committing this type of a crime. R/O in the presence of JAMES and Security Officer PHIL RYAN interviewed subject FRANKLIN. FRANKLIN was very cooperative and talkative to R/O and went over his activities the prior weekend. Briefly stated, MR. FRANKLIN, whose parents live in Vallejo, never left the Vallejo area that weekend and stayed around home talking with his mother, stepfather, and three brothers. After interviewing subject, it was the opinion of R/O Sgt. Lonergan that this subject was not the responsible. He had a definite very fast manner of speaking which was completely opposed to the victim's statement concerning the suspect's voice. R/O also contacted the mother of the suspect, a MRS. OPAL at Hollywood Avenue, Vallejo. MRS. OPAL stated more or less the exact same thing that her son had stated as to his whereabouts that weekend. It appears that this subject has a reliable alibi as to his activities and had no access to a vehicle that weekend.

(Note: R/O taped electrically the interview with victim HARTNELL.) Victim HARTNELL related the following.\nHe had known CECELIA SHEPARD for some time, they were good friends, and she had come to the Napa County area to spend the weekend. She and a female companion, DALORA LEE, Aspen, Loma Linda, San Bernardino County, Calif. (phone Ext. 2155) had driven from Southern California and were to drive back Sunday, 9/28/69.

While lying on the ground, victim HARTNELL stated he heard a noise and asked MISS SHEPARD if she could hear anything or see anything behind a tree not far from where the couple were lying. MISS SHEPARD told victim HARTNELL she could see a man behind the tree. HARTNELL asked her what he was doing. MISS SHEPARD stated she couldn't tell. HARTNELL stated he (suspect) then came from behind the tree. MISS SHEPARD said, \"\"Oh my God, he has a gun!\"\"\nVictim HARTNELL stated the man approached the couple, aiming a black steel automatic pistol. The suspect stated he needed a car and money. Suspect stated his car was \"\"hot\"\" and he wanted victim HARTNELL's car keys. Victim HARTNELL stated he began talking with the suspect, telling the suspect he had no money, only a small amount of change, also that if the suspect was really in need of assistance HARTNELL would attempt to help him.

Victim could not remember what type of shoes or anything about suspect's hands, could not remember if suspect was wearing gloves.\nVictim thought suspect was possibly 20 to 30 years of age by voice concept. Victim stated suspect was 5'8\"\" to 6', 225-250 lbs., dark brown hair, eyes unknown, sloppy dresser, stomach hanging over trousers. Suspect spoke with some\nPage 17\n(2)\ntype of drawl, but victim stated it was not a Southern drawl, did not really know what type of drawl, but thought the man was not well educated, but did not feel he was illiterate either. Victim said suspect's voice was moderate in sound, that is, not high or low pitched.\nSuspect told victim he was sent to (?) Lodge State Prison (possibly Deer Lodge State Prison), Montana, for a killing. While there (in prison) he killed a guard while escaping. Suspect also told victims he was heading for Mexico, told victim he was flat broke.\nVictim observed cut-up rope in suspect's rear pocket (trouser's), also stated he was wearing a knife in a case (on belt) on his right side, near front of trousers. Knife description: Appeared to be a long bread knife, 12\"\" long blade, 3/4\"\" wide, hardwood handle, 2 brass rivets holding handle in place, cotton surgical tape wrapped approximately 1\"\" around handle of knife. Knife case possibly made of wood.\nVictim asked suspect if suspect's gun was loaded. Suspect removed magazine from handle of pistol and showed victim a bullet removed from gun, bullet described as a possible .45 caliber. Victim did not know what caliber the pistol was.\nSuspect had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him, suspect then tied victim SHEPARD's hands, then re-tied HARTNELL's hands, then tied both victims' ankles together, had victims lie on their stomachs. HARTNELL stated suspect said, \"\"I'm getting nervous.\"\" This was when suspect was tying MISS SHEPARD'S hands, in fact HARTNELL stated suspect got real shaky when he was tying MISS SHEPARD's hands.\nVictim HARTNELL then stated that without warning the suspect plunged his knife into the back of HARTNELL. Suspect did this repeatedly, HARTNELL stated he thinks six times. HARTNELL stated he pretended to be dead and the suspect went over to MISS SHEPARD and stabbed MISS SHEPARD repeatedly in the back, and when MISS SHEPARD turned her body over (on back), suspect stabbed her in the lower abdomen. Victim stated suspect stabbed MISS SHEPARD much worse than him. Suspect went into some sort of frenzy when stabbing MISS SHEPARD.\nVictim HARTNELL stated suspect left the area after the stabbing. Victim HARTNELL hailed a boat (off shore) and told the man in the boat the couple needed help badly. Victim stated the boat left the area and he (victim) attempted to get help by crawling and walking to the road. (Victim believed he had walked to the road, however had not gone too far from his wounded companion.)\nVictim stated he thought suspect had been with the couple for approximately fifteen (15) minutes from time of observing suspect until suspect departed.

ROBERTSON stated that Mr. HARTNELL was heavily sedated but was able to give a verbal statement pertaining to the attack at Lake Berrysessa. The interview was taped and reads as follows:\n\"\"INTERVIEW OF JOHN ROBERTSON, DET/SGT., NAPA COUNTY SHERIFF's DEPARTMENT, WITH BRYAN CALVIN HARTNELL (NSO CASE #105907) AT QUEEN OF THE VALLEY HOSPITAL ON SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1969 (TRANSCRIBED FROM TAPE RECORDING BY M. FEURLE):\n\"\"J.R. Can you give me this fellow's description and tell me what happened?\n\"\"B.H. So many people have been asking me... I hope...\n\"\"J.R. Well sometimes when we're repetitious, I know it happens to me, I tell the same thing over and over and over, and sometimes I might vary a little, and if you do...\n\"\"B.H. Shall I just start out and tell you what happened?\n\"\"J.R. I don't want to tire you out.\n\"\"B.H. I just don't want this to happen again to anybody... Of course he might have his reasons, I don't know...\n\"\"J.R. Okay. Go right ahead. Start right from the beginning. What happened?\n\"\"B.H. Okay. This girl came out from school, I used to go with her two years ago, and she's now going to another school, and she came up to visit some friends and we were having dinner at the school cafeteria, and I said, 'Well, are you doing anything special this afternoon?' and she said, 'Why?', and I said, 'I don't know. We could go out and either go for a walk, go to San Francisco, or, you know, just...', 'cause we used to be good friends. We used to have a good friendship. And so it got too late by the time we got around to what we were going to do. We had to stop in St. Helena for a couple items and then we had to cart a couple kids home and stuff, and by the time we finally got around to it, it was getting late, and I thought going to San Francisco 'd rush you, you know, because by the time we got back for worship... And so we went out to Berryessa, and there was this one place I used to go out... we used to all the time, you know... and I couldn't find it. And so I figured Ah, forget it, and this looks like as good a place as any. So I parked the car, there were no other cars there. I had a Kharman Ghia, '56, white, with a black vinyl top, and it's in pretty\nPage 2\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n... \"\"good-looking shape. But we parked there on the road's edge and we talked Oh it must be about a quarter of a mile to down to the place where we went. We had... (unintelligible) peninsula, it's an an island I guess during the wetter season, You can see where it was levee... And so that looked like a lot... there was a big spreading tree up there. There were two of them, really, one was a little bigger than the other. We took the one that was out on the point.\n\"\"It was really beautiful out there. We were sitting on top... I lay down on my back and she lay down on her stomach beside me, you know, kind of resting her head on my shoulder, and we were talking, you know, kind of reminiscing about old times, and stuff. And I heard these rustling leaves, and I said, 'You have your specs on. Why don't you see what the deal is over there?' And she says, 'Oh, it's some man.' And I said, 'Is he alone?' and she said, 'Yeah... (unintelligible)...' and she says, 'Well he just stepped behind the tree.' And I said, 'What's the idea of that? To take a leak?' You know, 'cause that's the only thing I could think of, just step behind a tree. And so I says, 'Well, keep looking and tell me what happens,' and she says, 'Oh my God, he's got a gun!' and squeezed my arm and\n\"\"And so he came out, and of course still actually I wasn't... There's some things you really wouldn't mind having happen, just for the experience of it. You know I thought, Well I only got fifty cents on me. It's worth all of that having it happen. I didn't think about another angle. So I talked to him, you know. I said, 'Well listen, Mac, (you know I'm in the sociologist field, you know, I'm pre-law, with history and psych.) You know I've read about the criminal mind and everything, you know. I thought well maybe the guy really does need help, you know. I says, 'There's no strings attached.' I says, 'I don't have any money right now but if you need help that badly I can help you out in another way maybe.' And he says, 'Nah.. time's running short,' he says, ''cause I just got out of... some prison in Montana, I don't know what the name of it is. Feathers? Do you know what the name of it is? I'll see if it sounds familiar. Fern or Feathers? It's some double name, like Fern Lock or something...\n\"\"J.R. It's Lodge..\nPage 3\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. Oh yeah, yeah, Lodge. At least we know we're together on that.\n\"\"J.R. Mountain Lodge Prison, or something of that nature...\n\"\"B.H. Yeah. You know he said he broke out and had to kill a guard getting out. And I said, 'Well, man, I mean actually I don't mean to call your bluff or anything, but wouldn't you rather be stuck on a stealing charge than a threat of homicide?' you know? And he says, 'Well just don't start playing hero on me.' You know, 'Don't try to grab the gun,' 'cause I didn't really figure the gun was loaded. I always thought it would be empty. I've heard a lot of times that this is what they do just as a bluff, but I decided not to call his bluff after he really, you know... I told him, 'You know you're really wasting your time with me. I've got a billfold and this much change and that's it.' And he said, he told the girl, 'Go tie him up. I'd feel much better if you were tied up.' And she tied a couple of loose knots on me, so I made it look kind of tight... (unintelligible)... you know, just for a second, and he said 'Go ahead.' And I whispered to her, 'You know I think I can get that gun.' And I said, 'Do you mind?' and she got kind of fearful about it, so I figured since there's two lives involved, not just mine, I won't do it.\n\"\"So I let her tie me up on the wrists again, and he tied her up, - terribly tight, you know, real... (unintelligible) ... put his gun away, and we were talking and all, bantering, you know, basically. I was thinking, anything I can do to help, by the way just to keep the conversation going... Suddenly he was taking it all seriously, you know... So I was starting out and finally he said, 'Okay, lay down. I've got her tied up', you know... He strung a rope between our ankles in the rear, so we were like this, you know, on our stomachs, tied...\n\"\"J.R. You both facing the ground...\n\"\"B.H. Right. And, oh, this was before. I got sort of ahead. So anyway, he said, 'Get down,' and I said, 'Oh come on! We could freeze to death!' I said that a couple, three times, and he said, 'GET DOWN! RIGHT NOW!' He got a little pushed off at me. So I got down and then he finished tying her up and clonked her down, - and then he goes... Sswhooosh (a sound with his mouth)... (unintelligible)\nPage 4\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"And so I said, 'Do you have bullets in there?' And so he pulled out the clip and showed me that he did. The bullets were about this long, I can remember, and about this fat, and they had the regular red cap on it, about this long. Maybe that doesn't give you any better description of the gun or not. I don't know. And it came out of the heel, the grip, you know. It slipped out from the bottom.\n\"\"And now, to backtrack a bit. I was really trying to see what he looked like, you know. He had on pleated pants, these old type of suit pants, you know, and they were either black or dark blue, I can't remember now. And I can't remember what he was wearing for shoes. But he had on this cotton coat, You've seen the kind, that you just turn the collar up once, there's a zipper down the front, you know. They're real light, super-thin, you know...\n\"\"J.R. Kind of a windbreaker...\n\"\"B.H. Yeah, like a windbreaker. And it's got this blue, this little collar, sometimes the guys wear them standing up, you know.\n\"\"J.R. What color was that?\n\"\"B.H. That was dark blue. And I don't know. Maybe he had something in his pouch. I just took it as being a... as being a... you know, he was stout 'cause he looked kind of heavy. I think he was weighing two and a quarter, two fifty, somewhere in there. And I got kind of a look at his hair. His voice... I can remember... almost like I'd heard it before. You know there's some drawls that a lot of people have similar. And... almost as if I'd heard it before... couldn't think where.\n\"\"I gave that one up, I just gave it up on that angle. I looked through his hair. I kind of looked like it was combed, you know, like this.. it was a brownish, you know, dark brown hair.\n\"\"And this mask he had on. It was ingeniously devised. It was... he had four corners at the top, like the top of a paper sack... black. It came down, came down, with the front panel about to here, and a kind of a thing that came over the shoulders, you know, and then the same thing down the back, straight down. And in the front he had a circle with a symmetrical cross in the middle. You know what I mean by a symmetrical cross?\nPage 5\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. Um hum (affirmative).\n\"\"B.H. The ends of the cross hung out about this far on each of the... you know, where it came out. The circle was this much... like this... and then it was like this, you see... hung out on the end, over the edge of the circle.\n\"\"And he had clip-on sunglasses... it was hard to tell. You know, the sunglasses you clip on when you're wearing glasses, eyeglasses, He had those clipped on. I'm pretty sure... I don't think he had glasses, though. I think he just had these clipped on to his suit... you know, that little mask.\n\"\"And I don't know how tall he was. Maybe 5-8 or maybe 5-10, 6 feet, somewhere in there. I'm a very poor judge of height because of my height. I have no meaning, you know. It's always down, you know. It can never be up...\n\"\"And so I saw him put away his gun, and I was turning to say something to Celia, and all of a sudden I felt my back... just... no, I think I saw him pull it out.. I don't remember... I think I saw him whip out his knife and just start stabbing me in the back... CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP! I was just (makes a gutteral sound)... you know that kind of a sound... and Celia turned to see why I was (repeats gutteral sound), you know, and she just about fainted. She went hysterical... (unintelligible) ... and when he finally stopped... I mean he went over and... The doctor says there's six in the back, six wounds on my back. You ought to confirm that. One I've got went clear through the lung. I've got it draining. I did drain a couple pints of blood out as soon as I got here. I lost an awful lot of blood, I guess.\n\"\"We were down... I mean it was absolutely no question in my mind... when a person gets stabbed as many times as we did... we were going to die. I mean there'd be no reason to question it. But somehow I, you know, started (unintelligible)... I just knew there was too much I had to live for. I mean really it does happen... about getting depressed and everything... when you're young you always think about these things... you know you think about it... and when you've got someone forcing your hand, oh well, there was a lot of things I had to do. And what really kept me going... you know my parents are pretty Christian. I haven't been too much of a Christian myself... but if you believe in the principle you ask God to help you. Another thing, What was my only strength was knowing two things. One, that I did not want to die, and two, that I felt that whatever was\nPage 6\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n\"\"going to be was going to be, but I was going to try my damnedest to stay alive. And so, like I say, - before I left her I kissed her, and I said, 'Well,' I says, 'I'm gonna try to get help.'\n\"\"There was a boat kept circling around out there in the lake and we started yelling at it and finally it came within about 100 yards of the shore and turned off its motor and stayed there watching us for about fifteen minutes, and we were just screaming hysterically, trying to get their attention, you know, to come over here. Oh, I don't know, I guess they were afraid that the guy might be there in the bushes and they were liable to get choked or something. So finally he came up a little closer. I didn't have my glasses on... I was just swaying, you know... and I had gotten one of her hands free before they came, and so I kept trying to get her to untie me, and she couldn't, she was too weak, she said.\n\"\"So finally I just kept hollering and hollering, and she said, 'Turn around and let's see if I can do it again.' She finally got it. My hands and my feet were just pure numbness... they're still numb but I'm sure that will go 'way. But I finally got... (unintelligible)... untie her so she could kind of relax out. 'Cause it was a terrible position, you know, upon our stomachs... (unintelligible)...\n\"\"And so I started to go for help. I finally got myself fairly reconciled. I wasn't too worried about dying, if that was what was going to happen, but I knew I had to keep pushing on. I had to force myself into staying alive because it was... I could just see myself... you know, all sort of waves would come over... I just (coughing sound)... (unintelligible)... 'Well, you're not gonna give up this easy', you know. And, like I say, I just kept believing that God would do everything the best, if the thing was gonna happen, but I couldn't see any reason why my dying would be the best good. So I just played along with that.\n\"\"I just started to walk toward the road... everything blacked out on me... my visual... my mind was never blacked out, but my visual was. So I lay down... My eyes started to come open... I just saw a haze of trees, you know. In a little while I got up and went another twenty feet, and then the same thing happened... (unintelligible)... and sat down. Next thing I went clear... (unintelligible)... the road, and by that time I just fell... I just... I was trying so hard to go far I just went too far. Finally I heard this pickup\nPage 7\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"coming... I was just laying alongside the road, and that's where this guy picked me up.\n\"\"They weren't in any hurry at all, it didn't seem like, you know, but they finally called an ambulance. About fifteen minutes later it came... (unintelligible)... but I still believe... I've got feeling... starting to get a little pain to come through. But from the minute that knife blade went in, it was nothing but pure shock from there on. I just did not expect it. I didn't expect that he would do that. That was a variable I had completely left out. And I guess he just took off running after we started running. I don't know. I never saw him before and hope not to see him again... at least outside of a courtroom.\n\"\"It's hard for me to explain much more. I mean I'm trying to give you a kind of example of his technique. He had some rope cut up in his back pocket. And he had a ... well, I thought it was a police automatic because it was in one of these black leather cases, you know...\n\"\"J.R. Was it in a smooth case, or did it have a basket weave like..\n\"\"B.H. Can I have my glasses? Oh, they're not here. It was a smooth one, though.\n\"\"J.R. Did he have this hood down to about the middle of his chest?\n\"\"B.H. No, about like... well, I'll show you... Here... his stomach.. You know I could see his... (voice fades away)\n\"\"J.R. Okay. You said his hair looked dark brown. How could you see his hair?\n\"\"B.H. 'Cause I saw it from where those goggles fit. I looked so closely to find out. And when he turned you know they kind of flittered... I could see his hair. It looked kind of greasy.\n\"\"J.R. Now was he as heavy as I am?\n\"\"B.H. Well I can't say 'cause he wasn't wearing those type of clothes. They were sloppy clothes, you know. And he just had on this old pair of pleated pants. I don't know... How tall are you?\n\"\"J.R. I'm about five eleven.\nPage 8\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. Well, like I say, he was dressed kind of sloppily, you know. His pants real tight up here and his stomach kind of pouched a bit, you know. I don't know... it's hard to say 'cause I can't judge you with being in a suit and all, you know, and him not being professional-looking at all. He could be about the same. It's hard to say. He was so sloppily dressed.\n\"\"J.R. Bryan, you also mentioned a drawl. Well not a drawl, an accent.\n\"\"B.H. It was just something... I guess his way of talking. It was something I couldn't repeat. It's like a song. Sometimes you know what you're going to say but you just can't sing the melody worth a darn.\n\"\"J.R. Did he have a throaty voice or a high pitched?\n\"\"B.H. In between. But it was just a unique way of talking.\n\"\"J.R. Did he sound like an educated man?\n\"\"B.H. Heck no! I don't think so.\n\"\"J.R. Did he sound illiterate?\n\"\"B.H. No. He didn't sound that way either. He just impressed me as being rather low class. The reason was because of his clothes, you know.\n\"\"J.R. Did you lose consciousness when he stabbed you at any time? Did you observe him stab Cecelia?\n\"\"B.H. Yeah...\n\"\"J.R. What did he say after...\n\"\"B.H. He stabbed her a bunch of times in the back. After she turned around, he got her once in the groin and one in the arm I think. He kind of went a little more hog-wild with her than with me. I faked dead... like that... I didn't want him to come back and give me some more.\n\"\"J.R. So you were pretty sure he thought you were dead when he finished working on you?\nPage 9\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"B.H. I think he kind of thought that. Of course I don't know because we started talking right after he left. It's hard to say... (unintelligible)... I don't think she fainted either.\n\"\"J.R. Was she in a lot of pain, did she tell you?\n\"\"B.H. Oh yeah. She was more weak at the time... (unintelligible).. from the religious angle. I told her I sure as heck wasn't going to have any deathbed conversion. 'No,' she says... (unintelligible)... I mean it was just like you were gonna die and had a few things to say. But I felt more and more I wasn't losing strength as much... (unintelligible)... that I thought I could cope with...\n\"\"J.R. What you did was a courageous thing. It was a terrible thing to have happen to anyone.\n\"\"B.H. Well there was nothing we could do. We were kind of at the mercy of him. I mean I wanted to get that gun... (unintelligible)... There was a time I think I could have gotten it...\n\"\"J.R. Did it appear to be a .45 to you? An automatic?\n\"\"B.H. It was about this long... along the stock... and had a wood edge on it, you know.. on either side...\n\"\"J.R. Handles.\n\"\"B.H. Yeah...yeah...\n\"\"J.R. Did the bullet look anything like that?\n\"\"B.H. No. It was kind of like this, only it was gold, and this part here came out along with this and then round the gold, round the blunt end. Not quite that blunt-ended, though.\n\"\"J.R. Was it fat? Fatter than this?\n\"\"B.H. Yeah, I think it was a little fatter. But it was gold, you know. And I didn't see any of this here. There was a part where it crimped... Well, almost like that 22, short, only a lot bigger. It was about like this length, maybe more stubby.\nPage 10\nSubject: UNKNOWN\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\n\"\"J.R. Well I'll get a .45 a little later and we can bring it up and let you observe it.\n\"\"B.H. \"\"Let's take the suspect. His hands... I don't remember if they had gloves on or not. I can't remember now. I keep thinking that he had gloves on. I can't figure how he tied us... Let's ask Celia, she probably knows about that.\n\"\"J.R. Did he swear? Did he use any profane language or obscenity?\n\"\"B.H. I don't think so. If he did it was no more than I was using at the time. I don't think he used any obscenity. He might have used a swear word or something, you know. That wasn't striking to me...\n\"\"J.R. Do you have any idea what his motive might have been? Money?\n\"\"B.H. Money. He said he was going to go to Mexico and he was flat broke.\n\"\"J.R. Did he search you after he...\n\"\"B.H. Heck no! Very unprofessional. He didn't even end up taking that loose change and didn't even take my billfold.\n\"\"J.R. Why did he stab you when you weren't fighting him off or anything?\n\"\"B.H. I couldn't. Even if I'd have wanted to. I was laying on my stomach...\n\"\"J.R. So what would have been the purpose of him to stab you, do you think?\n\"\"B.H. Well I (unintelligible)...but I think he got rattled... (unintelligible)... very, very nervous. His hands were shaking... (unintelligible)... Are you nervous?\n\"\"J.R. I'm just curious. If you could write me that symbol you were telling me about. Do you think you could draw me a picture of that even without your glasses?\n\"\"B.H. Um hum (affirmative). (Draws)... kind of like that. I can't see very well...\nPage 11\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. Yes, I see. Okay...\n\"\"B.H. ... (unintelligible)... that I could really die...\n\"\"J.R. Does this ring a bell?\n\"\"B.H. This one here. This is more like it, but I'm not sure. It was distinctly that design. It was thick. More thick marks.\n\"\"J.R. Okay. What color was this? Do you recall?\n\"\"B.H. Black. And that was white.\n\"\"J.R. This was black.\n\"\"B.H. No, that was white. It was about this tall.\n\"\"J.R. Two and a half, three inches?\n\"\"B.H. About four by four... three by three...\n\"\"J.R. How do you feel? Am I tiring you out too much?\n\"\"B.H. No. I've had a couple shots. It's not hurting me at all.\n\"\"J.R. Do you think Cecelia could tell me any more than you have already told me? Add anything?\n\"\"B.H. (unintelligible)\n\"\"J.R. Did he slap you around? Slap her?\n\"\"B.H. (unintelligible)... No.\n\"\"J.R. He was a much smaller man than you?\n\"\"B.H. Not much. About your height I guess. I don't know.\n\"\"J.R. Well you're getting kind of sleepy. I'll ease up on you.\n\"\"B.H. Have you gotten any clues at all?\n\"\"J.R. Yes, we've got some good clues. Before we get this guy it's going to take a lot of work.\n\"\"B.H. Remember he said he was headed for Mexico,\nPage 12\nSubject: UNKNOWN\n(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)\nCase INV 1-15-311-F9-5861\n\"\"J.R. He's headed for Mexico?\n\"\"B.H.

Was there anything in the paper today?\n\"\"J.R. No, it wasn't in...\n\"\"B.H. The Napa paper?\n\"\"J.R. Well there's no Napa paper on Sundays. It's been on the news media...\n\"\"B.H. Names? Did they name my name?\n\"\"J.R. I don't know, to tell you the truth.\n\"\"B.H. The reason I asked is my girl friend lives in Portland and I've got to talk to her before it gets to her...\n\"\"J.R.

Jimmy befriends insurance executive Thomas Gregory. Charlie's friend, novelist Paul Essex, dies aboard the aircraft after receiving a radiogram warning him not to ignore \"\"Zodiac\"\". His briefcase mysteriously disappears. Charlie meets with Deputy Police Chief J.J. Kilvaine, and runs into reporter and old friend Peter Lewis. Charlie also meets noted local magician Fred Rhadini, and discusses Essex's death with the three men. Rhadini tells Charlie about Dr. Zodiac, a psychic preying on the rich in San Francisco. Charlie, Rhadini, and Lewis go to Dr. Zodiac's home, where Dr. Zodiac conducts an eerie séance. Lewis' fiancée, Eve Cairo, has been meeting with Dr. Zodiac, angering Lewis. Later, Kilvaine reveals that Essex was poisoned, but can't rule out suicide. Jimmy spends the afternoon following Thomas Gregory, whom he believes stole Essex's briefcase when leaving the plane. He discovers Essex's manuscript in Gregory's hotel room.\n\nThat night, Charlie attends Rhadini's magic show at the Golden Gate International Exposition on Treasure Island. Rhadini's clumsy, comic acquaintance, Elmer Kelner, is helping to serve food and drink at the club. Charlie meets Eve Cairo and socialite Bessie Sibley, as well as Rhadini's jealous wife, Myra. During her telepathy act with Fred Rhadini, Eve comes into contact with someone thinking about murder and Charlie is almost killed when a knife is thrown at him.\n\nAfter the show, Charlie, followed by Rhadini and Lewis, break into Dr. Zodiac's home. They find Jimmy already there. Charlie discovers evidence that Zodiac is a fraud. When Zodiac's Turkish houseman, Abdul, arrives, Charlie searches him and finds the holster that fits the knife. Abdul escapes, and the burglars discover Zodiac's vast files which he uses to frighten and blackmail others. Charlie realizes Bessie Sibley is providing information on others to protect herself, and that Zodiac was blackmailing Essex. Charlie burns Zodiac's office to protect the innocent.\n\nEssex's manuscript is a fictional account of Dr. Zodiac's blackmail scheme, and the next morning Charlie finds that the last page revealing who the murder was committed is missing. Charlie meets with Gregory, who says he is an insurance company detective investigating mysterious suicides. Charlie believes Gregory's claim is false, and Gregory fails to steal the manuscript back. Charlie believes Dr. Zodiac suffers from pseudologia fantastica, and Rhadini challenges Dr. Zodiac to a public test of psychic skills. Dr. Zodiac accepts the claim by leaving a note on the front door of the Temple of Magic where Rhadini performs. It's written on the back side of the missing manuscript page. The manuscript mentions a pygmy arrow; a similar arrow from a display in the foyer of the Temple of Magic is missing.\n\nThat night, Charlie, Jimmy, Bessie Sibley, Myra Rhadini, and Peter Lewis attend Rhadini's magic show, where he is assisted by Eve Cairo and Elmer Kelner. Dr. Zodiac appears during the show, and is invited on stage. As Rhadini performs a levitation trick, Zodiac is killed with the pygmy arrow. Dr. Zodiac is revealed to be Abdul. Although a bow is found, it is too brittle to have fired the arrow. Zodiac must have been stabbed with the arrow. Gregory gives Rhadini an alibi after discovering Rhadini's wand in the aisle by his seat. Kilvaine reveals that Gregory is Stewart Salsbury, and that he really is an insurance company executive.\n\nAt Kilvaine's suggestion, the murder is re-enacted with Lewis standing in for Zodiac. The secret of Rhadini's levitation trick is revealed, and Rhadini is stabbed in the aisle during the act. Myra uses the \"\"sphinx\"\"—an upright metal pseudo-Egyptian coffin with a hidden elevator in its floor—to go from the stage to the below-stage area, where her husband's dressing room is located. Charlie encourages Eve to try to tap into the mind of the killer. Eve reads Charlie's thoughts, which describe the motivations of Stella Essex, Bessie Sibley, Thomas Gregory, Peter Lewis, Fred Rhadini, and Myra Rhadinia (although without mentioning their names). The mind of Dr. Zodiac interferes with Eve's mind. Eve reads Zodiac's mind, and discovers that the real Dr. Zodiac killed Abdul because only Abdul knew Dr. Zodiac's real identity.\n\nThe killer attempts to shoot Eve while she is on stage, but Jimmy spots the pistol and pushes the gun away just in time. Dr. Zodiac is revealed to be Fred Rhadini. While all eyes were on Eve, he sneaked into the wings, ran below the stage, and used the elevator in the sphinx to re-emerge on stage and attempt to kill Eve. Charlie reveals that Rhadini used a wand with a spring trigger to fire the arrow that killed Abdul. He then stabbed himself to divert attention from himself as a suspect.\n\",,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Chan_at_Treasure_Island,,,reccUFdR1Rx0fLRip,,1939,August,Thursday,,Cultural

Includes scenes of fair-goers dressed in period costume, dancing and playing music. Also includes an interview with Phyllis Patterson (1932-2014), co-creator of the Renaissance Faire concept in America with Ron Patterson, who explains that in addition to this annual event: \"\"What we would like to do is to have a Renaissance Center, where there can be craftesmen working all year round. Where there can be an old English inn with serving maids, where people can come and spend a while out of the hustle and bustle of the Twentieth Century.\"\" It should be noted that the Northern California Renaissance Faire is still held annually and in 2018 will open on September 15th and 16th near Hollister, CA.

Created and produced by Rod and Phyllis Paterson, the fair is designed to recall the old English heritage that accented the fun filled aspects of life. Phyllis, tell me what you hope to do here.

Includes brief views of the faire, shots of a very long line of cars snaking towards the camp grounds and an interview with a spokesperson who explains that with upwards of 10,000 people trying to visit each day along a 2-lane highway, they might need to find another site which can provide better access. It should be noted that the faire eventually relocated from it's China Camp site to Novato's Blackpoint Forest in 1971. As White puts it: \"\"Perhaps there's some special significance that so many people would endure such heat and such a mammoth traffic jam for the simple purpose of trying to escape. And it seems a pity that such simple attempts at escape into the Sixteenth Century can't be accommodated by the Twentieth Century.\"\" Opening graphic designed by Carrie Hawks.\n\n00:00:09.340 - 00:00:23.280\nThis is a slice of the pleasure, fair and Khalfani market. This Renaissance faires started three years ago in San Francisco, and it's grown such proportions that no longer can handle the huge crowds that one in 10,000 people a day are allowed in. That number is usually\n\n\n00:00:23.280 - 00:00:37.310\nreached in the first two or three hours of its opening. By two o'clock in the afternoon, the people are turned away by the hundreds. The result. A new home may have to be found for this 16th century event next year. Well, first of all, because the\n\n\n00:00:37.310 - 00:00:52.160\naccess to this area here as beautiful as it is and we truly love this site as beautiful it is, though we are have the access Excuse me of a two lane highway, and with the crowds to come here to the fair upwards of 10,000 people, we\n\n\n00:00:52.160 - 00:01:04.430\nhave to have a close highway to a fair site where we can handle all the cars and get at the same time. It's got to be far enough away from civilization where people can truly step back into the 16th century and not be hassled, shall we\n\n\n00:01:04.430 - 00:01:17.960\nsay, by 20th century necessity in other words, they can get the whole feeling of the fair and move back into the 16th century. And yet we still have to find an area where the cars can move in. And we can get people in and out without\n\n\n00:01:17.960 - 00:01:28.450\nthe Highway Patrol having too much of a problem without us having too much of a problem. And so people can move easily in and out of the fairgrounds. And this is why we think we're gonna have to move from this site here as beautiful as you\n\n\n00:01:28.450 - 00:02:00.110\ncan see it.

But the killer wrote a letter making jest of the sketch, insisting that it does not resemble him.\nCab driver Paul Stine was the victim of a senseless Zodiac slaying. \nThis young couple was slashed to ribbons by the sadistic monster who later boasted of the deed in letters to newspaper editors. \n\nA detective checks a blood-soaked patch of cloth, sent through the mail by Zodiac, with the shirt of the madman's latest victim. They matched.\nThe Zodiac became angry at stories written by Paul Avery. So he sent this card, threatening to kill the reporter.\n\n\"\"WHEREVER HE IS—HE WILL KILL AGAIN!\"\"\nAfter writing the bloodiest chapter in modern criminality the most feared killer of the 20th century has disappeared. Could he be in your city? \n\nWhen the final book on satanic brutality is written, such names as Bluebeard, the Cleveland Butcher, England's John Christy and Jack the Ripper will receive prominent mention. But none will receive more prominent display than the name \"\"Zodiac\"\". \nThe man who calls himself \"\"Zodiac\"\" has a snakepit for a mind, brimstone for a heart and the nerve of a programmed robot. The police know he has committed five merciless murders. By the \"\"Zodiac's\"\" own boast, he has killed thirteen. His calling card is a strip of bloody clothing torn from the body of a victim. He is a cunning madman who writes riddles in a strange code that baffles even the most expert military cryptographers. He is the single-most baffling crime phenomenon of our generation. \nFor almost two years, the \"\"Zodiac\"\" held the San Francisco Bay Area in the palm of his hand—pricking it ever now and then just to watch it jump. Then, he disappeared. It has been almost two years since his last, evil message was received. Some say he is either dead, in prison or in a mental institution. But most lawmen still working on the case believe he is lying low after almost being caught on one occasion. Some think he has moved out of the Bay area and taken up residence in another city. And those who know him best do not even speculate on if he will kill again. They only try to guess when it will happen and where. \n\nby CARMENA FREEMAN \n\nThe Christmas greeting was one that had been belched up from the caverns of Hell. It had taken nine days to travel from San Francisco, California to Munich, Germany, during which time it had passed through extensive police laboratory examination before being dispatched to the rightful recipient, Attorney Melvin Belli, then on business in the German city. The message bore no relation to the Peace on Earth tidings that temporarily link men and nations in brotherhood over the holidays. The greeting was a plea, a threat, and a reminder that some place on California's West Coast lurked a killer of extraordinary dimension; a man who was known to have taken five lives and who had boasted of taking many more. It was a message from a man who once threatened to bomb a school bus full of children, a man who used for his calling card scraps from the bloodied shirt of his last known victim. \nThat Christmas card, received on December 29, 1969, halfway across the world from where it was posted, did not take its place on the mantle piece along with other reminders of the season. It served, instead, as a fresh prod to Attorney Belli to try to break through the killer's impregnable mask; it served to swell the staggering file of material gathered for over a year in the police departments of San Francisco's Bay Area—a file labeled simply \"\"Zodiac.\"\" \nThe letter to Belli read: \"\"Dear Melvin, This is the Zodiac speaking. I wish you a happy Christmas. The one thing I ask of you is this, please help me, I cannot reach out for help because of this thing in me won't let me. I am finding it extremely difficult to hold it in check I am afraid I will lose control again and take my ninethe and possibly tenth victim. Please help me, I am drowning. \n\"\"But if I hold back too long from No. nine I will lose all control of my self... Please help me. I cannot remain in control much longer.\"\" \n\nThe maniacal ravings of an unhitched mind? Perhaps. But Attorney Belli, internationally recognized legal expert and highly successful defender in numerous courtroom battles, did not dismiss it as such. Two months earlier, on October 22, 1969, Belli had appeared on a popular San Francisco TV program at Zodiac's request and had held up his end of one of the most bizarre telephone conversations ever recorded. \n\n\n\nThe events leading to Belli's appearance that October morning were typical of Zodiac's unique and stunning pattern of behavior. He had phoned Jim Dunbar, host on KGO's early morning TV talk show and specified that he wanted Belli to appear on the program that day at which time he (Zodiac) would call in and reveal himself. \n\n\nWhat unmitigated gall, you say. What would lead a wanted killer to think the nation's TV channels were open to his personal whim, or that the services of one of the country's leading attorneys were available? But ah, you have not reckoned with Zodiac. Whatever finis is written to his history, that history will nudge Bluebeard and Jack the Ripper aside for space in the biographies of the world's most cunning slayers. \n\n\nThe killer had not labeled himself Zodiac until August, 1969, but his fiendish hand had been at work as far back as December of 1968, and as the exhaustive research into his past continued, there came startling evidence that he had introduced his specific brand of horror as early as 1966. \n\nZodiac's brazen disregard for convention had first manifested itself on August 1, 1969, in three separate letters, one to each of the managing editors of the \nSan Francisco Chronicle, the Examiner, and the Vallejo Times-Herald. \n\nThe letter to the \nTimes-Herald started: \"\"Dear Editor, I am the killer of the 2 teenagers last Christmas at Lake Herman and the girl last 4th of July. To prove this I shall state some facts which only I & the police know. \n\n\"\"The facts: Christmas\n1. Brand name of ammo Super-X\n2. 10 shots fired\n3. Boy was on back feet to car\n4. Girl was lyeing on right side feet to west 4th of July\n5. Girl was wearing patterned pants\n6. Boy was also shot in knee\n7. Brand name of ammo was Western\"\" \n8. \nAttached to the letter was a neatly printed code with the explanation: \"\"Here is a cipher or that is part of one. In it is revealed my true identity. The other two parts have been mailed to the S. F. \nExaminer & the S. F. Chronicle. \n\n\"\"I want you to print the cipher on your front page by Fry afternoon Aug. 1, 1969. If you do not do this I will go on a kill rampage Fry night that will last the whole week end. I will cruse around and pick off all stray people or couples that are alone, then move on to kill some more untill I have killed over a dozen people.\"\" \n\nThe signature was a cross inside a circle, simulating the cross hairs in a telescopic rifle sight. \n\nThe editor knew to which murders the letter referred. The first had taken place close to midnight on December 20, 1968, on the Lake Herman road several miles outside of Vallejo. The bodies of two young people were discovered sprawled beside a station wagon by a ranch wife on her way into Benecia to pick up her children from a movie. Town officers were dispatched immediately to find 16-year-old Bettylou Jensen, dead of five bullet wounds in her back, and 17-year-old David Faraday near death from a single bullet hole in his skull. Both youngsters were students in the Vallejo schools, well liked, bright, and handsome. The area where their bodies were found was one popular to young lovers and police directed their early efforts toward pinning down a jealousy motive or locating a disgruntled suitor of the girl. \n\nThe initial theory that the seeds of the tragedy had been sown within the confines of the city of Vallejo and its immediate surroundings and that continued questioning, prodding, and the follow-up of meager clues would lead to the killer vanished with explosive force when Sergeant Lundblad received a telephone call from a local youth. The boy was reporting a weird experience he had had at the scene of the murders just shortly before they occurred. He and a girl were parked in the same area at 9:30 that Friday night. \"\"I thought no one else was around,\"\" he said. \"\"Then I saw these backlights come on. I gunned our car out of there and the other driver followed me. I'm not sure he was actually chasing us because he never gained. I turned off toward Benecia and he went in the oppostie direction. That was the end of it until I read what happened in that same place an hour and a half later.\"\" \nThe boy's story lent a disconcerting blow to previous speculation and opened up a far more disturbing possibility. Bettylou and David apparently were random victims of a roving nut who haunted lovers' lanes and picked off his targets at will. \nThe second shooting occured sometime after midnight on July 4th, while fireworks were still brightening the skies over the Bay waters. The attack took the life of a 22-year-old Vallejo waitress, Darlene Ferrin, and came within a hair's breadth of killing her escort. Three youths came upon the victims stretched beside their car not far from the municipal golf course in Blue Rock Springs Park, on Vallejo's outskirts. \nDeath claimed the young waitress before she reached the hospital, but a thin trace of life pulsed in her escort and the officers who circled the car examined the ground, gauged the murder weapon and searched for clues. The officers clung desperately to the hope that the critically injured youth would be able to supply some lead to his assailant. \nThe investigation was only minutes old when a freak note was injected in the form of a phone call to the woman clerk in Vallejo's police headquarters. \"\"I want to report a double murder,\"\" a male voice said. \"\"If you will go one mile east on Columbus Parkway to a public park you will find the kids in a brown car. They were shot with a 9 millimeter Luger. I also killed those kids last year. Goodbye.\"\" \nThe Ferrin car was brown. Nine millimeter shells were found at the scene. There had not been time to publicize these findings. The caller had to be taken seriously. And what of his sinister end note, \"\"those kids last year\"\"? Was he also the Faraday-Jensen killer? \nThe young man said that he and the girl had just pulled off the road when their car door was jerked open and the gunman let loose a fusillade of shots. The girl fatally wounded fell back behind the wheel, but the youth managed to tumble out of the door and to fake death until the gunman drove off. \n\n\n\"\"His car? You saw it?\"\" \n\n\"\"Yes. It was remarkably like Darlene's. Same color, brown, and the same model. Carried California license plates.\"\" \n\nInvestigators chased down tips, followed up leads, correlated procedures on the Lake Herman and Columbus Parkway shootings, but by the beginning of the next month, when the bewildering message in code arrived, neither case was near a solution. \n\nThree days after the first letters were received, a second message came to the \nSan Francisco Examiner. It opened with the ominous greeting, \"\"This is the Zodiac speaking.\"\" Contained in this communication were references to the two Vallejo shootings that proved to the satisfaction of Deputy Lundblad and Police Chief Jack Stiltz that they were, without question, dealing with the three-time killer. It was this letter, irrefutably authored by the slayer, that provided the popular name by which he was to be called during the course of his criminal life—\"\"Zodiac\"\". \nIt was a high school teacher and his wife from North Salinas, California, who, by combining training, skill and remarkable tenacity, succeeded in unscrambling the code, thereby giving to its author a cloak of such fearsome pattern as to panic the sturdiest of men. \nDeciphered, the message, with all of its misspellings, read: \"\"I LIKE KILLING PEOPLE BECAUSE IT IS MORE FUN THAN KILLING WILD GAME IN THE FORREST BECAUSE MAN IS THE MOAT DANGERUES ANIMAL OF ALL TO KILL SOMETHING GIVES ME THE MOST THRILLING EXPERIENCE.. THE BEST PART OF IT IS THAE WHEN I DIE I WILL BE REBORN IN PARADICE AND ALL THE I HAVE KILLED WILL BECOME MY SLAVES I WILL NOT GIVE YOU MY NAME BECAUSE YOU WILL TRS TO SLOI DOWN OR STOP MY COLLECTING OF SLAVES FOR MY AFTERLIFE.\"\" \nThat Zodiac was mindful of this lapse in caution became apparent to a stunned county on September 27, 1969, in one of the most awesome displays of savagery ever perpetrated. \nHis diabolical signature was first evidenced on that Saturday afternoon when a fisherman, working the waters of Lake Berryessa... heard the weak but urgent cries for help from what appeared to be two figures on the shore some 20 yards away. Reluctant to investigate on his own, the fisherman gave throttle to his boat and soon returned with Berryessa Park Rangers Sergeant William White and Dennis Land from the nearby ranger station. What they found Ranger White later described as the worst thing he'd ever seen, \"\"two nice kids cut to pieces.\"\" \nThe \"\"two nice kids\"\" were Cecilia Shepard, a 21-year-old coed from the University of California in Riverside... and 20-year-old Bryan Hartnell, a junior in the college. Those two students, their splendid young bodies ribboned by knife slashes, lay on the lakeshore on a carpet of sand reddened by their blood. Their wrists and ankles held the gnawed ends of rope that had lashed them in bondage. \nThey had driven up to the lake for a picnic, parking Hartnell's car on a knoll above the shore. They thought themselves to be alone, but at roughly 4 p.m., an apparition slid out from behind a tree and approached them, a stocky man in baggy black pants, his face covered by a shoulder-length hood, his hand waving an automatic pistol. \n\"\"I'm a fugitive,\"\" he announced, \"\"I killed a guard in escaping from Deer Lodge Prison in Montana. I need money and a car.\"\" \nThe youth offered him all he had, 75 cents, and handed him the keys to his car. But the gunman had changed his mind. \"\"I'm going to have to tie you up,\"\" he said, pulling a length of cord from his pocket. He ordered Miss Shepard to tie up Hartnell, then he bound the girl, hands and ankles. The gun had been replaced by a knife and when both victims were securely trussed, the hooded monster began plunging the weapon repeatedly into first the man, then the girl, accompanying each thrust with a maniacal laugh. For what seemed an eternity to the horrified, screaming, helpless victims, the merciless butcher continued. Their tormentor first slashed, then stabbed as his hideous laughter echoed along the banks of the lake. \nWith the arrival of the ambulance, the victims were rushed to the Queen of the Valley Hospital in Napa while investigators began the loathsome task of gathering up mementos of the assault.  Chief among these was the car door from Hartnell's Karman-Ghia on which the hooded assailant had scrawled three dates: December 20, 1968; July 4th and September 27, with the hour, 6:30. The signature brought chill of recognition to the examining officers: a circle within which were the cross hairs simulating a telescopic gunsight. \nIf there was any question in the minds of the investigators that the Lake Berryessa atrocity was the work of the same man who murdered young Faraday, Miss Jensen and Miss Ferrin, that doubt was dispelled within minutes with the receipt of a phone call at 7:30 that evening in the Napa County Sheriff's office. Deputy David Straight answered the ring. \"\"I want to report a murder,\"\" a man's voice said. \"\"No, a double murder. I just killed two kids. They are two miles north of park headquarters. They were in a white Volkswagon Karman-Ghia. I'm the one who did it.\"\" \nThe call was ended abruptly, but there was no sound of the receiver being replaced. Police swarmed over public phone booths and in a neighboring car wash found the receiver dangling from its wire. \nA day later, Miss Shepard was dead, but the information she had supplied, along with that provided by Hartnell, gave the officials the first physical data available on the four-time killer. He was not, investigators proved, an escapee from the Deer Lodge Prison in Montana. He was, according to the patchy descriptions obtained from the two students, probably in his 30s, somewhere between 5 feet 9 inches and 6 feet tall, weighing in the neighborhood of 200 pounds. Through the overlarge eye holes cut in the hood, Hartnell was able to get a glimpse of brown hair and of spectacles covered with sunshades. The killer was husky of voice and had been armed with a pistol, not a Luger, and a butcher knife some 10 to 12 inches long. \nThe kinship took on straight blood lines the morning of October 13, 1969, when the editor of the Chronicle slit open a letter addressed to him and stared down at a swatch of blood-stained shirt that fell from the envelope. The Chronicle had received its invitation to become the killer's pen pal. \n\"\"This is the Zodiac speaking\"\" the accompanying letter began. \"\"I am the murderer of the taxi driver over by Washington St. and Maple St. last night. To prove this here is a blood stained piece of his shirt. I am the man who did in the people in the north bay area. \n\"\"The S. F. police could have caught me last night if they had searched the park properly instead of holding road races with their motorcycles seeing who could make the most noise. The car drivers should have just parked their cars & sat their quietly waiting for me to come out of cover.\"\" \nThe cabbie to whom Zodiac referred was Paul Stine, a night driver for Yellow Cab, who had picked up a fare in front of San Francisco's Fairmont Hotel Sunday evening and followed instructions to take him to Washington and Maple Streets. A few blocks short of the destination, the passenger, riding in the front seat, pulled a 9mm automatic from his coat, drilled Stine once and fatally through the cheek, took his wallet, ripped a strip from the cabbie's shirt and calmly stepped from the death car. He wiped the door clean and strode off into the protection of the Presidio's woods. \nThree youngsters witnessed this much of the drama and passed it on in breathless relay to investigators, adding the information that the killer was white, 25 to 30 years old, roughly 5 feet 9 inches tall. His reddish brown hair was close cut and he wore heavy-rimmed glasses. \nA partial estimate of that depth was revealed three days later when police released the complete text of the letter the \nChronicle had received that Monday morning. \"\"School children are nice targets,\"\" he had written. \"\"I think I shall wipe out a school bus some morning. Just shoot out the front tires and then pick off the kiddies as they come bouncing out.\"\" \nAt 7:14 the studio phone rang. Belli took the call. A soft, boyish voice was transmitted into the homes of thousands of hypnotized listeners. Then the caller hung up. Minutes later, he called again. \"\"Meet me on the roof of the Fairmont Hotel,\"\" he instructed Belli. \"\"Come alone or I'll jump.\"\" \nFor three hours, the brief but regular phone calls came. The caller was asked to abandon the ominous name of Zodiac and agreed to be called Sam. He expressed curiosity about what would happen to him if he surrendered. Belli assured him of a fair trial and offered to see that he got medical treatment. \nThe phone call to Oakland, they believed, was made by Zodiac. The calls that came through to the TV station were the antics of a fake. Sam was sick. Sam was in need of treatment. But Sam was not Zodiac. \nThese suspicions were buttressed by the conclusions of those who had previously heard Zodiac's voice.  All of them, the woman clerk from the Vallejo Police Department; Deputy Straight from Napa; Bryan Hartnell who survived the vicious Lake Berryessa knifing and Miss Ferrin's escort who recovered from the bullet wounds received on July 4th, listened to playbacks of the taped TV conversations. \"\"Not the Zodiac,\"\" was the verdict. \nIn the second part of the letter, one of the longest the Zodiac had submitted, he claimed seven instead of five victims, expressed anger at the lies the police were telling about him, and announced that henceforth he would not admit to murders he committed. \"\"They shall look like routine robberies, killings of anger, & a few fake accidents. \n\"\"The police shall never catch me because I have been too clever for them.\"\" \nHe then listed all of the ways in which he had been \"\"too clever.\"\" \n\n1. I look like the description passed out only when I do my thing, the rest of the time I look entirely different. I shall not tell you what my descise (disguise) consists of when I kill. \n2. As of Yet I have left no fingerprints behind me contrary to what the police say in my killings I wear transparent fingertip guards. All it is is 2 coats of airplane cement coated over my finger tips. quite unnoticible and very efective. \n3. My killer tools have been boughten through the mail order outfits before the ban went into efect except one & it was bought out of the state. \n\"\"I was walking down the hill to the park when this cop car pulled up & one of them called me over & asked if I saw anyone acting suspicious or strange in the last 5 to 10 min & I said yes there was this man who was running by waving a gun & and cops peeled rubber & went around the corner I directed. I disappeared into the park a block & a half away never to be seen again. \nAlthough it was not disclosed at the time, it was later reported that San Francisco police had questioned one man in the Presidio woods the night of the Stine murder. Through an unexplained error in the transmitted radio instructions, police had been told the wanted killer was black. For this reason, no specific attention was given to the man to whom they spoke. \nAs she neared the town of Patterson, she was flagged down by a motorist who advised her that her left rear wheel was loose. He volunteered to fix it. His offer was accepted, but when the woman set off again, the wheel fell to the ground, and the man suggested that he drive her to a garage. He pocketed the keys to her car and started down the highway with the woman and her daughter. They had gone only a few miles when the woman realized that he had no intention of finding a garage. He drove her along deserted rural roads for more than two hours, making no overt advances, but threatening her with death in the soft, calm voice of a maniac who meant it. Through sheer luck, the woman finally was able to fling herself and child from the car and to hide in a culvert until he tired of hunting for her and drove away. She managed to reach Patterson where she blurted out her story to the local police. In the course of describing her tormentor, she glanced up at the official bulletin board where a wanted Zodiac poster was tacked. \"\"That's the man,\"\" she screamed. \"\"My God, that's the man who picked me up.\"\" \nThe Vallejo Times-Herald now put it in print:\"\"...so I now have a little list starting with the woman & her baby that I gave a rather interesting ride for a couple of hours one evening a few months back that ended in my burning her car where I found them.\"\" \nBy October, Zodiac was claiming 13 victims. \"\"Some of them fought. It was horrible.\"\" \nIt was during this same month, on the eve of Halloween, that Zodiac, for the first time, swung away from a nameless list of potential victims and singled out one person on whom to vent his spleen. That person was Paul Avery, the \nChronicle's astute crime reporter who had penned the major share of the Zodiac stories that appeared in that San Francisco journal. \"\"You are doomed,\"\" Zodiac informed Avery through his favorite device, a greeting card. \nAvery's block-buster had been distilled from a long forgotten murder file in Riverside, California. A file numbered 352-481, which contained all the evidence attached to the slaying of Cheri Jo Bates, who, in 1966, the year of her death, was an honor student in Riverside City College. \nOn the morning of October 31 of that year, a groundskeeper came upon the body of Cheri Jo, pierced with knife wounds and nearly decapitated from a slash across the throat. Investigators back-pedalled through the evening hours of Sunday, October 30, and learned that Cheri Jo had driven her Volkswagen into the parking lot of the school library at 6:10 p.m., spent 20 minutes in the library, and returned to her car at 6:30. An examination of the machine revealed that in her absence someone had tampered with the motor, jerking the middle wire loose from the distributor. There was evidence that the vandal then waited for the girl and lured her to her death with an offer to drive her to a garage. \nA month later when two letters, identical in their wording, were delivered to the \nPress-Enterprise in Riverside and the Homicide Detail of the local police department. \"\"She was young and beautiful,\"\" the letters started. \"\"But now she is battered and dead. She is not the first and she will not be the last. Miss Bates was stupid. She went to the slaughter like a lamb. She did not put up a struggle. But I did. It was a ball. I said it was about time. She asked me 'about time for what?' I said it was about time for her to die. I am not sick. I am insane. But that will not stop the game.\"\" \nExactly five months later to the day, the mails disgorged a fresh flood of \"\"Cheri Jo\"\" letters; one to the \nPress-Enterprise; one to the police department, and, cruelly, one to the dead girl's father. The message in triplicate: \"\"BATES HAD TO DIE THERE WILL BE MORE.\"\" Two of the notes carried an abbreviated signature a printed Z. \nHis verdict: \"\"The hand-printing scratched on the desk is the same as on the three letters, particularly like that on the envelopes, and this hand-printing is by the same person who has been preparing the Zodiac letters that have been received by the Chronicle.\"\" \nThat confidence was severely shaken on April 7, 1972. On that day, a 33-year-old legal secretary from Marin County was walking near her home when she was knocked to the ground by a car. The driver went to her assistance and offered to drive her home. When she refused, he flew into a frenzy, stabbed her, and fled.

After reading the report, Mr. [REDACTED] issued a 288 PC complaint on the suspect as well as a search warrant for his residence being a trailer at Sunset Trailer Park, Space A7. A warrant was also issued on the suspect and bail was set at $5000.00 by Judge James [REDACTED]. The search warrant was also issued for the following personal property to wit: 1) one jar of cold cream or white lubricant 2) hand or bath towels with cold cream or lubricant thereon 3) such other and further physical evidence tending to show that the offense of 288 PC has occurred including, but not limited to photographs, letters, diaries, memos, notes, books or magazines.\nAt approximately 8:50 a.m. on 9/27/74 R/O responded to the suspect's residence along with Det. Sgt. Walker, Det. Sgt. Carlstedt and Deputy Biehler. The suspect was not at home. R/O then proceeded to serve the search warrant. We found that the door to the residence was locked, but gained entry with the assistance of a lock pick. We searched the entire residence and found the following: one 16 oz. jar of vaseline approximately one quarter full on a shelf on the inside of the bedroom; one jar of cold cream also on this same shelf; we also found a piece of wood approximately 8-10\"\" in length which resembled that of a dildoe; also found on the bed was a a large bath towels multicolored stripes; also hanging from a small cupboard at the end of the bed was another large bath towel, multicolored stripes. These two towels as well as the vaseline, coldcream and the piece of wood were photographed and taken into evidence by I.D. Technician Nick Flint. Before departure, a copy of this search warrant was left inside the residence with a list of the property that had been removed. A short time later the issued warrant was sighted at Stopper and Kirk Lumber Company which is approximately one block from Sunset Trailer Park. At this time he was advised of the outstanding warrant against him and taken into custody. R/O and Deputy Biehler then transported him to the Sheriff's Office.\nR/O and Deputy Biehler then proceeded to interview the suspect. The time that the interview started was approximately 9:50 a.m. Suspect was advised of the allegations as well as the penal code section that he is being charged with. He was also shown the warrant. R/O then advised him of his rights per Miranda. Suspect said he understood these rights and would waive them and talk to me.\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Haas, [REDACTED]\n- TYPED BY: sh\n- DATE AND TIME: 9/30/74\nPage 2 (Marked -2- in top right)\nSONOMA COUNTY SHERIFF\n2555 MENDOCINO AVENUE\nSANTA ROSA, CALIFORNIA\nCASE NO.

This rights waiver form was witnessed by Deputy Biehler. The form was signed at 9:58 a.m. At approximately 9:59 a.m. R/O proceeded to tape the interview.\nOnce the tape was started I again asked the suspect if he understood and would waive his rights and again he indicated that he did understand his rights and would waive them. I again informed him of the charge against him and he almost immediately started asking questions about a disposition of the case. He wanted to know what would happen if \"\"supposing\"\" he pled guilty. He asked how pleading guilty would affect the disposition. He wanted to know if the judge would be more lenient with him if he did plead guilty. The suspect was very concerned about what type of sentence he would get. He says he worked at Atascadero approximately 15 years ago and did not want to become an inmate there. The suspect even asked R/O if he could borrow a sheet of paper. This was provided to him by me. On this paper he wrote the words \"\"guilty\"\" and \"\"defender\"\" opposite each other. He then asked me what would happen if he pleaded guilty at this time. I informed him that he would be booked in the County Jail, he would have a right to two phone calls and to bail which is at $5000.00. He then asked me what would happen if he asked to see a Public Defender. I informed him that he would still be booked into the County Jail and still be allowed to phone calls and bail. See attached written pieces of paper that was taken into evidence.\nSuspect was very concerned about his future. At one point he said \"\"I can always confess guilty, but I would like to talk to a Public Defender\"\". R/O contacted the Public Defender's Office by phone, but was informed that all the attorneys were in court. Investigator Dick Gore advised me he would respond to my office. A few minutes later Mr. Gore came in and advised the suspect after he was informed of his rights that he should keep silent other than advising me of his name and address. The suspect then requested to speak to R/O again. Mr. Gore then left.\nThere was more talk about disposition of the case and R/O could only tell him as to past experience in regards to sentencing. After approximately 45 minutes the suspect again indicated he wanted to speak to a Public Defender. The interview was then terminated. The suspect was then booked into the County Jail.\nInvestigation to continue in regards to another possible victim. This possible victim is a 14 year old male, last name of [REDACTED].\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Haas, [REDACTED]\n- TYPED BY: sh\n- DATE AND TIME: 9/30/74\nPage 3 (Marked CR 2964-87 in top right)\nSONOMA COUNTY SHERIFF\n2555 MENDOCINO AVENUE\nSANTA ROSA, CALIFORNIA\nCR 2964-87\n- 1.

R/O also asked him about any 288a type situations that may occur. David says that on numerous occasions Leigh would place his mouth upon David's penis and suck. He said he would have his mouth down there about one minute. David further advises that afterwards he would \"\"force\"\" David to place his mouth on Leigh's penis also for approximately one minute. He said Leigh would have him move his head in an up and down fashion. David does not know if anything like an ejaculation occurred with Leigh. He also doesn't know if Leigh's penis was hard or soft. He says it was kind of inbetween hard and soft. He also says he has not observed Leigh touching himself in any way.\nDavid says he knows the difference between telling a truth and telling a lie and he would get into trouble if he told a lie. He says he is telling R/O the truth today and knows he would be in serious trouble if he did not tell the truth. In R/O's opinion David is telling the truth and will make a very good witness in court. It is also R/O's opinion that the suspect bought David's cooperation and silence by giving him money after each and every occurrence.\nWith the assistance of David's mother, Beverly [REDACTED], it was determined that at least one act occurred sometime between July 11 and July 25 of this year. She says she remembers that Leigh Allen visited her home around 5 to 6 p.m. on a Thursday. She advises the Thursday would be after July 4 but before August 1. This would leave July 11, 18 and 25. She advises that at this time David indicated he wanted to go fishing. Leigh then suggested they go fishing right then. With Beverly [REDACTED] consent, they both left the residence. Apparently they did not return until 10 or 11 p.m. When later asked about this David said they went fishing at Spring Lake, but first stopped off at Leigh's trailer where a sexual offense was committed.\nR/O then talked to Jaime David Hamilton [REDACTED], 9 years of age. He confirms David's report of being told by David that \"\"Leigh forced me to screw him\"\". Jaime says that David told him more than one time what had happened. David says that he was forced by Leigh into this act. I asked Jaime what he meant by \"\"screw\"\" and he indicated it had nothing to do with Leigh's penis. Jaime does not remember when David told him, but said it was probably sometime in August. Jaime said he knows Leigh but has never been alone with him. Jaime also indicated he has never been a victim of Leigh. R/O then concluded the interview with Jaime. R/O has no further information at this time.\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Haas, [REDACTED]\n- TYPED BY: sh\n- DATE AND TIME: 9/25/74\nPage 5 (Marked -2- in top right)\nSONOMA COUNTY SHERIFF\n2555 MENDOCINO AVENUE\nSANTA ROSA, CALIFORNIA\nCASE NO.

The note indicated that R/O should attempt to contact a Beverly [REDACTED] in regards to her son, David, possibly being the victim of a molestation. The note further says the possible suspect is a Arthur Leigh Allen who resides in the Sunset Trailer Park on Santa Rosa Avenue.\nAt approximately 9 a.m. R/O made phone contact with Beverly [REDACTED]. She briefed that she believed her son had been the victim of a molest by Arthur Leigh Allen approximately a month ago. After a brief conversation, I told Mrs. [REDACTED] to bring her son into the Sheriff's Office at 3 p.m. this date for an interview. She also indicated that David's best friend, Jaime [REDACTED], also knew something about the molest. I also requested that she bring in Jaime at 3 p.m.\nAt approximately 3:30 p.m., 9/24/74, Beverly [REDACTED] accompanied by her son, David, and Jaime [REDACTED] contacted R/O. I then interviewed Beverly [REDACTED]. She says that Arthur Leigh Allen has been a \"\"friend of the family\"\" for approximately one year. She says that he has taken a great interest in David and he appeared to be a very nice man. She says he and David had gotten along real well. According to her, Leigh (Arthur Allen) lives alone in the Sunset Trailer Park. On numerous occasions he has visited her and David at her residence. Also on numerous occasions he has requested he be allowed to take David home with him or on fishing trips. She had not had any indication up until yesterday that there was something wrong. She further advises that at approximately 11 p.m. on 9/23/74 she talked to David, and Jaime who also resides with her talking in bed. It should be noted that Beverly [REDACTED] and a friend, Sharon [REDACTED] share the same dwelling. Sharon [REDACTED] is the mother of Jaime [REDACTED]. She goes on to say that she asked why they weren't asleep and David said he had something to tell her. She asked what it was and David told her that Leigh had forced him to do things that were bad. At this time she took him into another room and asked him what he meant by that. His reply was that when Leigh takes him home to his trailer, he makes him go into the bedroom and forces him to take off his clothes and then he also forces him to lay on the bed. David goes on to say Leigh takes his own clothing off and gets on top of him and puts his penis between his legs and \"\"humps me\"\". Beverly [REDACTED] asked David if Leigh had hurt him and David says that he had not, but it did scare him. She further asked David why he did not tell her what had happened before this. David says he meant to, but he kept forgetting. He also says that Leigh always gave him money and told him not to tell anyone about it.\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Haas, [REDACTED]\n- TYPED BY: sh\n- DATE AND TIME: 9/25/74\nPage 6 (Marked -3- in top right)\nSONOMA COUNTY SHERIFF\n2555 MENDOCINO AVENUE\nSANTA ROSA, CALIFORNIA\nCASE NO.

She further asked David why he always wanted to go back to the trailer with Leigh. David says he likes Leigh but doesn't like the things he does to him. David also told his mother it had happened several times.\nR/O then, after taking a written statement from Beverly [REDACTED], taped an interview with her son, David. The taped portion of the interview started at 4:11 p.m. and was concluded at 4:41 p.m. During the interview, David said he has known Leigh for quite sometime. He says Leigh lives in a green and white trailer in a trailer park on Santa Rosa Avenue. As far as he knows Leigh lives alone. David says he has been in Leigh's trailer \"\"quite a lot\"\". He said the last time was sometime during the past summer. David goes on to say Leigh \"\"forces\"\" him to take off his clothing and lay on the bed. He says Leigh then takes off his own clothing and gets on top of him. David says he then \"\"screws me\"\". R/O asked David what he meant by \"\"screw\"\" and he replied that Leigh puts his \"\"penis\"\" between his legs and goes up and down. R/O asked David what he meant by \"\"penis\"\" and he says that you use the penis to go to the bathroom with. David describes Leigh's penis as being \"\"big, long and round\"\". David however is not sure as to whether Leigh's penis is hard or soft. He says prior to this sexual act, Leigh put some creamy white stuff between his legs. This cream is kept in a clear white jar which is normally kept on a shelf in the bedroom. David says he (Leigh) always rubs this white cream between his legs prior to screwing him. R/O asked David how long Leigh screws him and the reply was 15 to 30 minutes. David describes Leigh's body as going up and down. R/O could not determine from asking David questions whether or not Leigh had an ejaculation. He goes on to say that after Leigh was through he would wipe the cream off with a towel. David says Leigh always gives him money afterwards. This apparently is either 25¢ or 50¢. He further states this has happened more than 12 times during the summer, but does not know exactly how many times. He says Leigh told him on several occasions not to tell anyone.\nR/O asked David why he did not tell his mother and he says he meant to, but always forgot. He did say he told his friend Jaime about it and also told him to remind him to tell his mother, but still would forget to tell his mother until last evening. David indicated he did tell Leigh he didn't like what was going on and wanted it stopped. He says Leigh's reply was \"\"I know you don't like it but I'm just a nasty man\"\". David says that Leigh would molest him everytime he and David were alone. Also, that is the first thing they would do together is go to the bedroom. Afterwards, they would do whatever they were planning on.\n- REPORTING OFFICERS: Haas, [REDACTED]\n- TYPED BY: sh\n- DATE AND TIME: 9/25/74\n\n\",1,1,1,1974-09-25,1974-09-25,Arthur Leigh Allen,Sonoma County Sheriff's report on Arthur Leigh Allen molestation charge,Fact,https://www.zodiackiller.com/SonomaReport1.html,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"errorType\"\": \"\"emptyDependency\"\", \"\"isStale\"\": false, \"\"state\"\": \"\"error\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2026-02-15T17:19:09.000Z,true,Arthur Leigh Allen's trailer,sonoma-sheriffs-search-ala-s-trailer,160,rec8hogdM9wm1STXN,,,,\nrecXWIWFBz95hjA2J,Count Marco's Chicago letter referencing Red Phantom,1962-10-02,,\"recXWIp8s3P3TAYiu,recnog62LVFsETdfp\",,,\"rec5NLNj8q2bpKjm8,rec7mWjRsgHKOVGuk\",,\"image.png (data/media/attbY1wyqDEMlJBr3_image.png),image.png (data/media/attSVxAL1pKBZRXbe_image.png)\",,recihWtdD3EWJSmS6,\"reca1CGmX8QNFkDDK,recZHBNn1SOnJ26Dn\",1962,October,Tuesday,recISLlMUV2t4GZ0s,Media Event,1962-10-02T00:00:00.000Z,10/2/1962,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Count%20Marco%27s%20Chicago%20letter%20referencing%20Red%20Phantom&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Count%20Marco%27s%20Chicago%20letter%20referencing%20Red%20Phantom&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2025-09-28T22:43:11.000Z,,,1962-10-02T00:00:00.000Z,,\"Title: 1974 Red Phantom Letter\n\nDate: 1974-07-08T00:00:00.000Z\n\nAuthor / Source: Zodiac, San Francisco Chronicle\n\nOrigin / Postmark: \"\"San Rafael, CA\"\"\n\nEvents: The Red Phantom Letter is mailed, Count Marco's Chicago letter referencing Red Phantom, Red Phantom letter and Badlands letter are published in SF Chronicle\n\nRelated People / Groups: \n\nTags: Zodiac Letters, The Red Phantom (Red with rage)\n\nLocations: \n\nSource: \n\nText: \n\",2,1,2,1974-07-08,1974-07-08,\"San Francisco Chronicle, Count Marco (Marc H.

Upon reviewing information submitted there seems to be sufficient cause to initiate an investigation to ascertain the validity of this information. Information consists of the following points which are only brief inquiries into the background of the alleged suspect. This information is viewed as circumstantial at best, but sufficient to require follow-up investigation.\n\n**Point #1.** There is in existence two composites of the alleged Zodiac Killer, one from San Francisco; one from Berryessa; and a brief description from the surviving victim in the Vallejo 187. This alleged subject (suspect) tentatively matches the description given in all cases. A photograph submitted from a driver's license taken in 1969 of the suspect has a good resemblance to the composites from other jurisdictions.\n\n**Point #2.** Research into the suspect's military background indicates that he did receive seven (7) months of training in military code work and then was an instructor in crytograph.\n\n**Point #3.** He apparently knew the family of the victim's as a mysterious caller. Placed three separate calls within 2 hours after Darlene Ferrin's death to each of the family members. These calls were made before media announcement of the murder and made certain references indicating the caller knew Darlene.\n\n**Point #4.** The suspect spent many hours at the restaurant where Darlene worked as a waitress. This has been verified by a [REDACTED] Officer, Officer Balding who has picked the subject's picture out of a lineup indicating he has\n\n* **SIGNATURE OF REPORTING OFFICER:** Lieutenant Husted\n* **ID NUMBER:** 253\n\n---\n### **Page 2**\n\n**AGENCY:** Vallejo Police\n**CASE NUMBER:** 243 164\n**PAGE NO:** 2\n\n**NARRATIVE**\n\nbeen seen in there conversing with the deceased.\n\n**Point 5.** An incident had occurred in Vacaville in regard to threatening letters received and phone calls made. This suspect has been identified as an individual seen in a parked car in the area where the young woman lived. His vehicle matched exactly the description of the car seen parked in the area of this young woman's apartment in Vacaville and tentatively his photograph has been identified as the man sitting in that vehicle. In regard to the same case he was accurately described by witnesses who indicated the same young woman in the Vacaville Incident had apparently gone to a mountain area to visit a relative some 200 miles north. The suspect matched the description of the individual who followed her to that area.\n\n**Point #6.** It appears that during most Zodiac activities the suspect was unemployed. It has been correlated that during suspect's periods of employment there were no Zodiac incidents reported. Suspect is a member of alcoholic anonymous and has had a problem with alcohol for a number of years. He's been involved with alcoholics anonymous ever since 1962. This, in turn gives him an unusual amount of freedom from his family responsibilities, especially at night.\n\n**Point #7.** There are several clues in the letters that appear to have application to the suspect. One of which refers to a post card received by the San Francisco Chronicle on 3- of 71 indicating \"\"Sought victim 12, peek through the pines\"\". It has been established that suspect lives in a very thick group of pine trees in a remote area, and you can only see the residence by looking down or peeking through the pines down the roadway. Further, there was another remark made by the Zodiac that \"\"I was swamped out by rain we had awhile back.\"\" suspect lives in\n\n* **SIGNATURE OF REPORTING OFFICER:** Lieutenant Husted\n* **ID NUMBER:** 263\n\n---\n### **Page 3**\n\n**AGENCY:** Vallejo Police\n**CASE NUMBER:** 243 164\n**PAGE NO:** 3\n\n**NARRATIVE**\n\nthe noted time period, meaning month of the year, this area is subject to heavy flooding, and photographs have been obtained of the area in the general vicinity of subject's house while it was flooded.\n\n**Point #8.** The suspect did, in fact, own a vehicle that approximates the suspect car on the Vallejo Homicide. That being a white 1961 Chevrolet.\n\n**Point 9.** A young woman by the name of Karen [REDACTED] was a babysitter for the deceased Darlene Ferrin during the months of January through May of 1969. She reports an incident where an older white male matching the general physical description of the Zodiac and the alleged suspect was watching the residence of Darlene. Upon questioning Darlene in regard to this, Darlene indicated she had seen this subject do something awful and indicated it was murder. At that time she allegedly said the name.\n\n**Point #10.** Another point seems to be involved in homosexual activities as is documented by a report of the Solano Sheriff's Office received as to suspect hanging around the rest stop area on Hunters Hill engaging in homosexual activities. He was questioned by Sergeant Lundblad in regard to these activities, and another incident was brought up on regarding his behaving in a hostile manner towards a CHP officer. A documentation is also available on this.\n\nReporting Officer, upon reviewing these points of interest, elected to initiate an investigation.\n\nOn 6-10-77, contact was made with one Karen [REDACTED], WFA, 25 years, [REDACTED] phone [REDACTED]. Reporting Officer requested an interview with Miss [REDACTED] in regard to the above mentioned incident with Darlene Ferrin. She complied. At VPD Miss [REDACTED] related that she was seventeen years old and baby-\n\n* **SIGNATURE OF REPORTING OFFICER:** Lieutenant Husted\n* **ID NUMBER:** 253\n\n---\n### **Page 4**\n\n**AGENCY:** Vallejo Police\n**CASE NUMBER:** 243 164\n**PAGE NO:** 4\n\n**NARRATIVE**\n\nsitting for Dean and Darlene Ferrin. Again, reiterated the months were from January through May of 1969. Stated she quit in May to overcome some guilt that she was feeling about covering up for Darlene's running around with other men while she was married to Dean. One of the men mentioned was the surviving victim in the Vallejo homicide Michael Mageau.\n\nKaren relates one incident that allegedly occurred while she was babysitting in approximately February or March 1969 at 560 Wallace. She stated she was babysitting approximately 10:00 p.m. one night, was looking out the front window of the Ferrin's apartment, and she noticed a man whom she took to be middleaged sitting in a white American-made sedan watching the apartment. She stated he was there for several hours but left before Dean returned from work shortly after midnight.

She did not note the license number and was only certain of the approximate age - middleaged, and the fact that the sedan was white.\n\nThe following day she related this incident to Darlene Ferrin who at the time recalled was in the bathroom putting on her makeup to go out. Darlene asked her what the car and the man looked like, and after relating a description to her, Dee said something to the effect, \"\"I guess he's checking up on me again.

Here is the transcription of the provided police report.\nPage 1\nAGENCY: Vallejo Police\nCASE NUMBER: 243 146\nPAGE NO: 1\nNARRATIVE\n6-5-77\nR.O. was contacted by a confidential informant in regard to possible new developments in the Darlene Ferrin 187 occurring 7-4-69 at the Blue Rock Springs Park, this is VPD File 243 146. Upon reviewing information submitted there seems to be sufficient cause to initiate an investigation to ascertain the validity of this information. Information consists of the following points which are only brief inquiries into the background of the alleged suspect. This information is viewed as circumstantial at best, but sufficient to require follow-up investigati1on.\nPoint #1. There is in existence two composites of the alleged Zodiac Killer, one from San Francisco; one from Berryessa; and a brief description from the surviving victim in the Vallejo 187. This alleged subject (suspect) tentatively matches the description given in all cases. A photograph submitted from a driver's license taken in 1969 of the suspect has a good resemblance to the composites from other jurisdictions.\nPoint #2. Research into the suspect's military background indicates that he did receive seven (7) months of training in military code work and then was an instructor in crytograph.\nPoint #3. He apparently knew the family of the victim's as a mysterious caller. Placed three separate calls within 2 hours after Darlene Ferrin's death to each of the family members. These calls were made before media announcement of the murder and made certain references indicating the caller knew Darlene.\nPoint #4. The suspect spent many hours at the restaurant where Darlene worked as a waitress. This has been verified by a [REDACTED] Officer, Officer Balding who has picked the subject's picture out of a lineup indicating he has\n- SIGNATURE OF REPORTING OFFICER: Lieutenant Husted\n- ID NUMBER: 253\nPage 2\nAGENCY: Vallejo Police\nCASE NUMBER: 243 164\nPAGE NO: 2\nNARRATIVE\nbeen seen in there conversing with the deceased.\nPoint 5. An incident had occurred in Vacaville in regard to threatening letters received and phone calls made. This suspect has been identified as an individual seen in a parked car in the area where the young woman lived. His vehicle matched exactly the description of the car seen parked in the area of this young woman's apartment in Vacaville and tentatively his photograph has been identified as the man sitting in that vehicle. In regard to the same case he was accurately described by witnesses who indicated the same young woman in the Vacaville Incident had apparently gone to a mountain area to visit a relative some 200 miles north. The suspect matched the description of the individual who followed her to that area.\nPoint #6. It appears that during most Zodiac activities the suspect was unemployed. It has been correlated that during suspect's periods of employment there were no Zodiac incidents reported. Suspect is a member of alcoholic anonymous and has had a problem with alcohol for a number of years. He's been involved with alcoholics anonymous ever since 1962. This, in turn gives him an unusual amount of freedom from his family responsibilities, especially at night.\nPoint #7. There are several clues in the letters that appear to have application to the suspect. One of which refers to a post card received by the San Francisco Chronicle on 3- of 71 indicating \"\"Sought victim 12, peek through the pines\"\". It has been established that suspect lives in a very thick group of pine trees in a remote area, and you can only see the residence by looking down or peeking through the pines down the roadway. Further, there was another remark made by the Zodiac that \"\"I was swamped out by rain we had awhile 2back.\"\" suspect lives in\n- SIGNATURE OF REPORTING OFFICER: Lieutenant Husted\n- ID NUMBER: 263\nPage 3\nAGENCY: Vallejo Police\nCASE NUMBER: 243 164\nPAGE NO: 3\nNARRATIVE\nthe noted time period, meaning month of the year, this area is subject to heavy flooding, and photographs have been obtained of the area in the general vicinity of subject's house while it was flooded.\nPoint #8. The suspect did, in fact, own a vehicle that approximates the suspect car on the Vallejo Homicide. That being a white 1961 Chevrolet.\nPoint 9. A young woman by the name of Karen [REDACTED] was a babysitter for the deceased Darlene Ferrin during the months of January through May of 1969. She reports an incident where an older white male matching the general physical description of the Zodiac and the alleged suspect was watching the residence of Darlene. Upon questioning Darlene in regard to this, Darlene indicated she had seen this subject do something awful and indicated it was murder. At that time she allegedly said the name.\nPoint #10. Another point seems to be involved in homosexual activities as is documented by a report of the Solano Sheriff's Office received as to suspect hanging around the rest stop area on Hunters Hill engaging in homosexual activities. He was questioned by Sergeant Lundblad in regard to these activities, and another incident was brought up on regarding his behaving in a hostile manner towards a CHP officer. A documentation is also available on this.\nReporting Officer, upon reviewing these points of interest, elected to initiate an investigation.\nOn 6-10-77, contact was made with one Karen [REDACTED], WFA, 25 years, [REDACTED] phone [REDACTED]. Reporting Officer requested an interview with Miss [REDACTED] in regard to the above mentioned incident with Darlene Ferrin. She complied. At VPD Miss [REDACTED] related that she was seventeen years old and baby-\n- SIGNATURE OF REPORTING OFFICER: Lieutenant Husted\n- ID NUMBER: 253\nPage 4\nAGENCY: Vallejo Police\nCASE NUMBER: 243 164\nPAGE NO: 4\nNARRATIVE\nsitting for Dean and Darlene Ferrin. Again, reiterated the months were from January through May of 1969. Stated she quit in May to overcome some guilt that she was feeling about covering up for Darlene's running around with other men while she was married to Dean. One of the men mentioned was the surviving victim in the Vallejo homicide Michael Mageau.\nKaren relates one incident that allegedly occurred while she was babysitting in approximately February or March 1969 at 560 Wallace. She stated she was babysitting approximately 10:00 p.m. one night, was looking out the front window of the Ferrin's apartment, and she noticed a man whom she took to be middleaged sitting in a white American-made sedan watching the apartment. She stated he was there for several hours but left before Dean returned from work shortly after midnight. She stated she could not really describe this individual and only knew he was middleaged because he either turned on the inside car light or lit a cigarette so that she got a partial look at the man. She did not note the license number and was only certain of the approximate age - middleaged, and the fact that the sedan was white.\nThe following day she related this incident to Darlene Ferrin who at the time recalled was in the bathroom putting on her makeup to go out.

When Mrs. Johns was quieted it was learned from her that a car had followed her from Modesto on Highway 132, and began blinking the lights in an attempt to get her to stop which she refused to do. Mrs. Johns states that after she had entered Interstate 5 that the vehicle then passed her, and at this time she stopped to check her car and was flagged to the wrong side of the road by a male subject who had been following her, had stopped, and had backed up the freeway. The man got out and advised her that the wheel on her car was wobbling and that he would fix it for her, that he began to take off a tire wrench and appeared to be tightening the lug bolts on her left rear wheel. The man then got into his own car and drove off without saying anything.

No.: 7425\nInjured Party: Mrs. Kathleen Johns\n Phone: (714) 886-1151\n Address: 617 Campus Way, San Bernardino\n Date Committed: 3/22/70\n Means of Attack: See body of report\n Where Committed: Interstate 5, South Patterson\n Reported by: Mrs. Kathleen Johns\n Time Reported: 0230 hours a.m.\n Reported to: Sgt. Charles J. McNatt, P.D.\n Suspect: See body of report\nCOMPLETE DETAILS OF CRIME AND DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY\nThis investigation is being conducted by Sergeant Charles J. McNatt, Patterson Police Department. In an attempt to evaluate the circumstances surrounding the alleged kidnapping of Mrs. Kathleen Johns, 617 Campus Way, San Bernardino, California, and her 10-month-old daughter Jennifer, on Interstate 5, north of Patterson at about 2315 hours, 3/22/70.\nOn the morning of 23 March 1970, at about 0230 hours, Mrs. Kathleen Johns was brought to the Patterson Police Department in a hysterical condition. When Mrs. Johns was quieted it was learned from her that a car had followed her from Modesto on Highway 132, and began blinking the lights in an attempt to get her to stop which she refused to do. Mrs. Johns states that after she had entered Interstate 5 that the vehicle then passed her, and at this time she stopped to check her car and was flagged to the wrong side of the road by a male subject who had been following her, had stopped, and had backed up the freeway. The man got out and advised her that the wheel on her car was wobbling and that he would fix it for her, that he began to take off a tire wrench and appeared to be tightening the lug bolts on her left rear wheel. The man then got into his own car and drove off without saying anything. Mrs. Johns then got into her own car and as she started driving off the wheel came off her car, whereupon the subject came back and said he would drive her to a service station. Mrs. Johns then got her infant into the car with the subject and he drove her around for what seemed to be an hour and a half or more, driving on back roads and stopping and turning around several times. She said he kept mumbling about killing people and throwing their bodies out of cars, and that he told her he was going to kill her and throw her baby out after he did so.\nShe said nothing during the ride and that at one point she attempted to get away, and he said if she did he would kill her. After driving around for some time the suspect’s car stopped at an intersection and Mrs. Johns grabbed her baby and ran across a field, hiding in a ditch until she saw the suspect drive off. She then walked or hitchhiked approximately two miles to the nearest road where she was picked up by a passing motorist and brought to the Patterson Police Department.\nMrs. Johns described the suspect as a white male, approximately 30 years old, 5'9\"\" in height, 160 lbs., dark hair, dark complexion, wearing a dark windbreaker jacket and black slacks. She stated she could identify him if seen again.\nMrs. Johns described the suspect’s car as a late-model tan or light brown sedan, possibly a 1957 or 1958 Chevrolet, with a spotlight on the left front fender. She stated there were no license plates on the front or rear of the vehicle.\nInvestigation revealed that Mrs. Johns’ vehicle, a brown 1957 Chevrolet station wagon, had been located burned approximately two miles west of Interstate 5 and one mile north of Highway 132. The vehicle was completely destroyed by fire, with the lug bolts on the left rear wheel missing. Deputy Lovett of the San Joaquin County Sheriff’s Office stated that a preliminary investigation showed the fire to be of incendiary origin.\nMrs. Johns and her infant daughter were taken to the San Joaquin General Hospital for observation and later released.\nInspector Tyrell of the San Joaquin County Sheriff’s Office and the San Francisco Police Department were contacted regarding the possibility of this case being connected with the so-called “Zodiac” suspect who has been operating in Northern California. Inspector Tyrell asked that a full report be sent to his office.\nDEPARTMENT OF POLICE — CITY OF PATTERSON\n P.O. Box 667 — Patterson, Ca. 95363\n Alex X. Kosch — Chief of Police\n Phone (209) 892-2031\nBy this department it was found that this was the first time the initial report from Mrs. Johns and that the report was to be sent to the Homicide Division, attention Inspector Armstrong and Inspector Toschi.\nWhen this office made contact with Inspector Tyrell no names were mentioned, only the bulletin number and SFPD case number was used.\nBurned vehicle was towed to Tracy on authority of the San Joaquin authorities who state that arson and kidnapping charges will be filed if and when the person is arrested.\nCharles J.

Arrived at the Patterson PD at 2:50 AM.\nContacted the complainant who stated at approx. 11:15 PM, 3-22-70 she had been driving on Hwy. 132 near Interstate 5 when she observed a late model vehicle, light tan in color, no other description, following her and blinking its lights as if the operator of the vehicle desired the complainant to stop. Complainant stated she stopped her vehicle, a 1957 Chevrolet S/W bearing Calif. Lic. HOU 518, somewhere in the area of Hwy. 132 and Interstate 5. She advised that the exact area is unfamiliar to her and that she was not sure where the vehicle had been stopped.\nComplainant stated that a WMA, approx. 30 yrs., 5’9”, 160 lbs., dark hair, wearing blk. rimmed plastic glasses, wearing a dark jacket and dark trousers, blue bell-bottomed pants, approached her vehicle and advised her that her left rear wheel of her vehicle was wobbling and that he would repair the malfunction. Complainant stated she stayed in her vehicle and observed the suspect tighten the lug nuts of the rear tire of her vehicle and upon completion then advised her the wheel was okay at this time and that she could proceed. The complainant then observed the suspect pull away from the roadway and across the area.\nComplainant stated she started her vehicle and was attempting to pull away from the curb when the vehicle came to a lurching stop at which time she exited the vehicle in an attempt to ascertain what the problem was. She discovered that the left rear wheel had fallen off the vehicle and it had only been secured by one lug bolt. She stated at that time she observed the suspect return in his vehicle and he advised her he would transport her to a service station in order to have the vehicle repaired. The complainant entered the suspect’s vehicle carrying her small daughter, approx. 10 mos., and left the area under the pretense that the suspect was attempting to locate a service station.\nComplainant stated the suspect drove around in the County area, possibly near Tracy, for approx. one and a half hours and would not allow her to leave his vehicle. She stated at one time he said, “I’m going to kill you and throw your baby out after you.” Complainant stated that beyond that, the suspect made no sexual advances toward her and merely eluded the question of stating anything further.\nShe was quite frightened, feeling that possibly the suspect intended to do some physical injury to her and that when the suspect stopped at a stop sign, she grabbed her daughter and ran away from the car into the fields and hid until she saw a passing motorist, who transported her to the Patterson Police Department.\nComplainant stated the suspect’s vehicle was light tan in color, possibly a 1957 or 1958 Chevrolet, with one spotlight on the left front fender, and there were no license plates on the vehicle.\nThe person transporting the complainant were not present upon this writer’s arrival, therefore their names remain unknown at this time.\nComplainant advised that she was not injured during the incident, nor her daughter had not been harmed.\nInvestigating Officer: Lovett #160\n Supervisor: Odelance #22\n Follow-up Officer: FRED WOODS\n Date: MAR 23 1970\n\",2,2,1,1970-03-23,1970-03-23,\"Kathleen Johns, Patterson Police Department\",\"Patterson Police Department on Kathleen Johns Incident, Stanislaus County Sheriff's Report on Kathleen Johns Incident\",Fact,zodiackillerfacts.com,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"errorType\"\": \"\"emptyDependency\"\", \"\"isStale\"\": false, \"\"state\"\": \"\"error\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2026-02-15T17:19:09.000Z,true,\"Patterson, CA\",kathleen-johns-reports-incident-to-patterson-police-dept,175,recBM8GSgFG8sgfDe,,,,\nrec7EyJcLerMa7Zew,Kathleen Johns is born,1947-05-30,,,,,recqcpvWj2OVS3S1w,,,,,,1947,May,Friday,,Birthday,1947-05-30T00:00:00.000Z,5/30/1947,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Kathleen%20Johns%20is%20born&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Kathleen%20Johns%20is%20born&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2025-10-08T15:04:51.000Z,,,1947-05-30T00:00:00.000Z,,,1,0,0,,,Kathleen Johns,,Fact,,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"errorType\"\": \"\"emptyDependency\"\", \"\"isStale\"\": false, \"\"state\"\": \"\"error\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2026-02-16T21:16:42.000Z,true,,kathleen-johns-is-born,176,rec7EyJcLerMa7Zew,6993893946957202dcba490f,Biographical Details,,\nrecsYrwJjfsR7hAet,Red Phantom letter and Badlands letter are published in SF Chronicle,1974-07-10,,\"rec3SXc62X9TM4dMm,recXWIp8s3P3TAYiu\",,,rec5NLNj8q2bpKjm8,,\"BadlandsInside.PNG (data/media/attHHMZu2gYzUlHat_BadlandsInside.PNG),BadlandsInside2.PNG (data/media/att5Y5eZWYgjEwa8y_BadlandsInside2.PNG),image.png (data/media/attAd0ys0l6XQvKDX_image.png),image.png (data/media/attNTHP6jnnuowaqC_image.png),CitizensEnvelope2.PNG (data/media/attObUOoiVwJdUhi8_CitizensEnvelope2.PNG),image.png (data/media/attbY1wyqDEMlJBr3_image.png),image.png (data/media/attSVxAL1pKBZRXbe_image.png)\",,\"rec95jZyzt6CoqhOY,recihWtdD3EWJSmS6\",,1974,July,Wednesday,\"recISLlMUV2t4GZ0s,recuG31SWMp2Pm4zt\",Media Event,1974-07-10T00:00:00.000Z,7/10/1974,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Red%20Phantom%20letter%20and%20Badlands%20letter%20are%20published%20in%20SF%20Chronicle&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Red%20Phantom%20letter%20and%20Badlands%20letter%20are%20published%20in%20SF%20Chronicle&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2025-10-09T19:07:40.000Z,,,1974-07-10T00:00:00.000Z,,\"Title: The Badlands Letter\n\nDate: 1974-05-08T00:00:00.000Z\n\nAuthor / Source: Zodiac\n\nOrigin / Postmark: \"\"Oakland, CA\"\"\n\nEvents: The Badlands Letter is mailed, Red Phantom letter and Badlands letter are published in SF Chronicle\n\nRelated People / Groups: San Francisco Chronicle\n\nTags: Zodiac Letters\n\nLocations: \n\nSource: https://zodiackiller.com/CitizenCard1.html\n\nText: Sirs—I would like to expression my consternt consternation concerning your poor taste & lack of sympathy for the public, as evidenced by your running of the ads for the movie \"\"Badlands,\"\" featuring the blurb—\"\"In 1959 most people were killing time.

Police could have caught me last night if they had searched the park properly instead of holding road races with their motorcicles seeing who could make the most noise. The car drivers should have just parked their cars and sat there quietly waiting for me to come out of cover.\nSchool children make nice targets, I think I shall wipe out a school bus some morning. Just shoot out the front tire & then pick off the kiddies as they come bouncing out.\n⌖\n\",3,1,2,1969-10-13,1969-10-13,\"Zodiac, Paul Lee Stine, San Francisco Chronicle\",The Stine

CHRONICLE\nSan Fran Calif\nPlease Rush to Editor\n\nThis is the Zodiac speaking\nUp to the end of Oct I have killed 7 people. I have grown rather angry with the police for their telling lies about me. So I shall change the way the collecting of slaves. I shall no longer announce to anyone. When I comitt my murders, they shall look like routine robberies, killings of anger, & a few fake accidents, etc.\nThe police shall never catch me, because I have been too clever for them.\n1. I look like the description passed out only when I do my thing, the rest of the time I look entirle different. I shall not tell you what my descise consists of when I kill\n2. As of yet I have left no fingerprints behind me contrary to what the police say in my killings I wear transparent finger tip guards. All it is is 2 coats of airplane cement coated on my finger tips—quite unnoticible & very efective.\n3. my killing tools have been boughten through the mail order outfits before the ban went into efect. Except one & it was bought out of the state.\nSo as you can see the police don't have much to work on. If you wonder why I was wipeing the cab down I was leaving fake clews for the police to run all over town with, as one might say, I gave the cops som bussy work to do to keep them happy. I enjoy needling the blue pigs. Hey blue pig I was in the park—you were useing fire trucks to mask the sound of your cruzeing prowl cars. The dogs never came with in 2 blocks of me & they were to the west & there was only 2 groups of parking about 10 min apart then the motor cicles went by about 150 ft away going from south to north west.\nMust print in paper [bolded areas below]\nps. 2 cops pulled a goof abot 3 min after I left the cab. I was walking down the hill to the park when this cop car pulled up & one of them called me over & asked if I saw anyone acting suspicious or strange in the last 5 to 10 min & I said yes there was this man who was runnig by waveing a gun & the cops peeled rubber & went around the corner as I directed them & I disappeared into the park a block & a half away never to be seen again.\nHey pig doesnt it rile you up to have your noze rubed in your booboos?\nIf you cops think I'm going to take on a bus the way I stated I was, you deserve to have holes in your heads.\nTake one bag of ammonium nitrate fertilizer & 1 gal of stove oil & dump a few bags of gravel on top & then set the shit off & will positivily ventalate any thing that should be in the way of the blast.\nThe death machine is all ready made. I would have sent you pictures but you would be nasty enough to trace them back to developer & then to me, so I shall describe my masterpiece to you. The nice part of it is all the parts can be bought on the open market with no questions asked.\n- 1 bat. pow clock—will run for aprox 1 year\n- 1 photoelectric switch\n- 2 copper leaf springs\n- 2 6V car bat\n- 1 flash light bulb & reflector\n- 1 mirror\n- 2 18\"\" cardboard tubes black with shoe polish in side & oute\nthe system checks out from one end to the other in my tests. What you do not know is whether the death machine is at the sight or whether it is being stored in my basement for future use. I think you do not have the manpower to stop this one by continually searching the road sides looking for this thing. & it wont do to re roat & re schedule the busses because the bomb can be adapted to new conditions.\nHave fun!! By the way it could be rather messy if you try to bluff me.\nPS. Be shure to print the part I marked out on page 3 or I shall do my thing ⌖\n\nTo prove that I am the Zodiac, Ask the Vallejo cop about my electric gun sight which I used to start my collecting of slaves.\n\",3,3,1,1969-11-08,1969-11-09,\"Zodiac, San Francisco Chronicle, Paul Avery\",\"Dripping Pen Card, Z340 Cipher, The Bus Bomb

Surrender**\n_By Hubert J. Bernhard_\n\nThe hunt for the “Zodiac” killer focused on the Fairmont Hotel this afternoon in the wake of a television show that featured a man who represented himself as the mass slayer.\n\nNob Hill’s famed hostelry entered the picture after a mysterious caller fenced for two hours with questioners on the call-in show while a huge Bay Area audience watched.\n\nThe caller promised to meet a prominent attorney later in the morning and surrender. He failed to keep the rendezvous—but police were reported to have a suspect in which they were “strongly interested”—possibly as a result of the aborted meeting.\n\n**Hotel Pickup**\nIt was after that that the Fairmont loomed as a key setting in the investigation.\n\nTaxi driver Paul Stine, 29, the “Zodiac” killer’s latest victim, is believed to have picked up the man who killed him on the street in the vicinity of the Fairmont.\n\nDuring the television broadcast this morning, the “voice” who repeatedly called the show told attorney Melvin Belli to meet him on the roof of the Fairmont—alone.\n\nBryan Hartnell, 20, who was wounded in the Lake Berryessa knife attack in which Cecilia Ann Shepard was killed by the “Zodiac” suspect, later listened to a replay of the entire television show.\n\nWhen the tape came to the point where the caller mentioned the Fairmont, Hartnell asked to have it replayed. It was—repeatedly—for more than 20 minutes.\n\n“Meet me on top of the Fairmont Hotel with nobody else, or I’ll jump,” the voice said.\n\n**No Recognition**\nHartnell gave no outward signs of recognition, but that was the only portion of the tape he asked to hear again.\n\nHartnell, one of three persons who heard the replay in a sealed room, was asked about a possible identification of the voice afterward.\n\n“I can’t say a word at this time,” he said. “We’re not sure. It’s too short to tell. We’re going to have another conference.”\n\nDuring the television show, a waitress in the Blum’s candy shop at the Fairmont telephoned to report that a man who resembled circulated pictures of “Zodiac” had stopped in for a cup of coffee.\n\nShe reported that she had put the cup and saucer aside for examination by police fingerprint experts.\n\nThe television show—springboard for a sequence of new developments in the suspenseful search for the slayer—was arranged by police.\n\nCapt. Martin Lee, chief of inspectors and head of San Francisco’s “Zodiac squad,” said police had no assurance that the mysterious caller was actually responsible for the five “Zodiac” murders.\n\n“I think the caller has a problem,” he said, “but whether he’s involved in the killings, I cannot say.”\n\nLee said the strange television performance was set up after a man telephoned “a neighboring police department” about 11 p.m. last night and offered to negotiate.\n\n**Sincere**\nHe was taken seriously, Lee explained, because he “seemed to have knowledge and he seemed sincere.”\n\nSan Francisco police did not talk to him directly, but they acceded to his request to have an attorney on the television show this morning to attempt to arrange a surrender.\n\nMelvin Belli, one of two lawyers the caller asked for by name, appeared on Jim Dunbar’s regular KGO-TV morning talk show as a result.\n\nA series of telephone calls ensued, at the end of which Belli—off the air—made a 10:30 date to meet the mystery man at St. Vincent de Paul’s Thrift Shop, 672 S. Mission Street.\n\n**Broke Date**\nHe and Dunbar went there at the appointed time, and police arrived half an hour later when it appeared the caller had no intention of keeping the date.\n\nBelli told reporters he hoped the man would telephone his office, saying he was “a very sick person and needs help.”\n\nThe rendezvous was arranged after Belli and Dunbar received 15 telephone calls during the two hours they were on the air.\n\nMost were obviously from the same person, although several seemed to be in a different voice. Belli expressed concern that someone else was entering the dialogue.\n\nThe caller represented himself as suffering from headaches and twice declared he had the urge to “kill again.”\n\n**Different Voice**\nBut _The Examiner_ learned that the police officer who took the original call that led to the broadcast said the voice on the Dunbar program was apparently not that of the man to whom he spoke.\n\nDuring the broadcast, in which the Dunbar show was kept on the air more than half an hour past its normal cut-off time, one San Francisco police inspector described the odds they were dealing with as “like flipping a coin.”\n\n**No More Calls**\nDunbar and Belli opened the conversation with the self-described killer by clearing the switchboard to accept no other calls than his at 7 a.m.\n\nPolice promised they would make no effort to trace the calls. The first call was at 7:14 a.m., during a commercial.\n\nThe audience heard Belli, when the commercial ended, saying:\n“Did you hear me?”\n“Yes, I did,” replied the caller in a soft, almost boyish voice.\n\nHe hung up, apparently because he was nervous. But he called back a few minutes later.\n\n**Call Him ‘Sam’**\nWhen Belli pleaded with him for a better name to address him by than “Zodiac,” the caller agreed to be referred to as “Sam.”\n\nHe asked a second time for a Fairmont rooftop meeting, setting no specific time for the rendezvous.\n\nDunbar and Belli assured him that the lines were not tapped, and that no attempt was made to trace the calls. They tried, too, to persuade him to say what police department he had called as evidence that he was indeed the man who initiated the conversations.\n\nDunbar and Belli tried to value “Sam” to identify the police department he’d contacted in order to determine whether they were dealing with the same man.\n\nHe parried their questions, however, and they never asked about the five murders charged to “Zodiac.”\n\nBelli assured the caller of a fair trial and repeatedly asked whether he wanted the attorney to contact District Attorney John J. Ferdon with a promise that no effort would be made to send him to the gas chamber.\n\n**Headaches**\nThe caller once said he suffered from “headaches,” adding that aspirin would not help. Then he hung up, and frequently during the strange sequence he said he was getting one again.\n\nWhen he called again, Belli asked how long he had suffered from headaches.\n“Ever since I killed that kid,” the caller replied.\n“Was that before last December?”\n“Yes.”\n\nDecember was the month in which the first of the murders attributed to “Zodiac” took place.\n\nOnce when the caller hung up, he did so declaring: “I don’t want to give myself up. I want to kill those kids.”\n\nAnother time, he said as he hung up: “I’m getting one of my headaches now. I’ve got to kill. I’ve got to kill.”\n\nSeveral times he made groaning sounds which explained by saying, “That’s my headache speaking.”\n\nBelli finally promised he would contact the district attorney’s office about leniency, and then he and Dunbar ended the show after agreeing to meet the caller “inside” at Daly City.\n\nDistrict Attorney Ferdon said later that his office had not been contacted by Belli, but that he would make no deals.\n\n“There’s nothing we will promise,” Ferdon said. “We are in no position to make promises to anyone named Zodiac. We don’t know whether Belli is representing this voice or not.\n\n“When the evidence is brought before us, then we will make a decision as to our proceedings.”\n\n**No Evidence**\nThe mysterious caller said nothing during the television show that could be taken as evidence he was indeed the man sought by officers of four jurisdictions.\n\nPolice in San Francisco and Vallejo, together with the Napa and Solano County sheriff’s offices, meanwhile set up a “hot line” for instant communication on the “Zodiac” case.\n\nAll departments have been involved in the investigation of murders attributed to the killer.\n\nThe close contact resulted from Monday’s meeting here to exchange every scrap of evidence and information involving the three murders in Vallejo lovers’ lanes, one at Lake Berryessa and the latest here.\n\nThe killer who calls himself Zodiac has boasted of the murders in cryptograms and letters sent to _The Examiner._\n\nMeanwhile, Chief Inspectors Lee confirmed of slugs taken from victims yesterday that ballistic tests and shell casings show that the killer used three and possibly four different weapons in his reign of terror.\n\nIt was known previously that a .22-caliber pistol was used to shoot and kill Betty Lou Jensen, 16, and her boyfriend, David Faraday, 17, in a lovers’ lane near Vallejo last Dec. 20.\n\nA 9-mm pistol killed Darlene Ferrin, 23, and critically wounded Michael Mageau, 19, in another lovers’ lane at Blue Rock Springs Park in Vallejo last July 5.\n\nA knife with a six- to eight-inch blade took the life of Miee Shepard, who was stabbed more than 20 times, and critically wounded her companion, Hartnell, who has recovered from 12 stabs.\n\nA 9-mm pistol took the life of Stine, 29. The slug taken from his body was too smashed to make a comparison with those in the Vallejo murder. It may or may not have been the same gun.\n\",,\"recr1nRRnrrkt7twD,recXJdTXSNJPLgeJ2,recMynsSg6Pjn1PzX,recIVF2meBzFCkEkr,recRujVzLi8fshv3Z\",,,,,,1969,October,Wednesday,,Media Event,1969-10-22T12:00:00.000Z,10/22/1969 12:00PM,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=%22Sam%22%20doesn%27t%20show%20up%20at%20Fairmont%20Hotel&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=%22Sam%22%20doesn%27t%20show%20up%20at%20Fairmont%20Hotel&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2025-10-14T03:48:22.000Z,12:00 PM,,1969-10-22T12:00:00.000Z,Screenshot_2025-10-18_at_10.38.01_AM.png (data/media/atttBTvPGEVbKWBm4_Screenshot_2025-10-18_at_10.38.01_AM.png),,5,0,0,,,\"Sam / Eric Phillips Weill, Melvin Belli, Fairmont Hotel, Martin Lee, John J.

The marriage was annulled and Best was jailed for child stealing.\n\nHe was freed on bail but helped Judy escape from a hospital where she was ill with hepatitis. Once again, they fled. In April, they were found in New Orleans, where—police said—Best had wrapped Judy’s newborn child in a towel and left it on a doorstep. The child later was adopted by foster parents.\n\nBest was sentenced to a year in San Francisco County Jail yesterday.

Sgt. Harold Thacker, officer in charge of the Juvenile Department, said the suspects all were Caucasians. He and Officers Jim Husted and Lee Vaughn had been working on the case almost unceasingly for weeks.\n\n“It’s one of the slickest operations we’ve ever come up against,” Husted said. “It wasn’t until we were able to develop a pattern of house burglaries in South Vallejo that we were able to solve it.”\n\nAs of Saturday afternoon, police had recovered approximately $3,500 worth of stolen goods.\n\n**Two Charged**\nThe adults who were jailed were identified as Casimiro (Casey) Saavedra, 26, of 137 Jordan St., and Louis Myers, 19, of 1182 Lewis Ave. Both were charged with possession of stolen property. Saavedra was freed on bail of $2,000, and the same bail figure was set for Myers who remains in custody.\n\nHusted said the men who were jailed owned the ring but hired the “little orders” for Saavedra, who allegedly advised them on the types of articles he wanted. “For example,” the officer said, “the youngsters, all in their mid-teen bracket, might be told to obtain an electric organ, a TV set, gun, or a watch.”\n\nThe “Fagin” involved in the operation even provided the accomplices with transportation to the homes that were to be robbed, Husted said.\n\n**Thefts**\nHusted said the series of burglaries began as long ago as last May.\n\n“But the ring, as far as we can determine, wasn’t organized until November, then things really started rolling,” he added.\n\nIn a single block, he said, as many as five homes were burglarized during the three months the burglary ring was operating at its peak.\n\nMost of the loot recovered was stored in Saavedra’s house, officers said. The suspect, however, denied any knowledge of the crime and told police the articles in his home were recovered by him after his home was burglarized.\n\nThe mystifying case was solved almost by happenstance, Husted said.\n\nIt was reported to him by a local school principal that a youth was attempting to sell a watch at school.\n\n“We looked him up, saw the watch, and thought it was quite a bit more expensive a watch than a boy his age ought to have,” Husted went on.\n\nUpon questioning, the boy admitted the watch had been taken in a house burglary, and implicated a second youth.\n\n“One thing led to another, but it wasn’t all that easy,” Husted said. “For example, we had to research all the burglaries that had occurred in Vallejo in recent months to determine from the reports the methods used and the sort of merchandise that was taken.\n\n“We think we have cleared up 53 house break-ins — there may be more.”\n\nThe youths that were booked either have been released in the custody of their parents, or are being detained in Juvenile Hall, Fairfield.\n\nThacker said the boys told him they were paid specified amounts for items stolen, such as $30 for the electric organ, $25 for a hunting rifle, and varying sums for jewelry, depending on its value.\n\n“These kids were as clever as adult professionals,” Thacker added. “They always wore gloves so they wouldn’t leave any fingerprints, and they never carried burglar tools.”\n\nThey also never committed any acts of vandalism in any house they entered. Entry, incidentally, almost always was gained by smashing a window, or opening a screen.\n\n“It’s a relief to have these burglaries cleared up,” Sergeant Thacker commented. “The whole department has been working night and day to solve them.”\n\nNo date has been set for the Municipal Court arraignments of Saavedra and Myers. The youths’ cases will be taken up in Juvenile Court.\n\",,recc6hamJAag6Gpsg,,,,,,1970,January,Saturday,,Suspect Event,1970-01-24T00:00:00.000Z,1/24/1970,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=A%20%28likely%20different%29%20Louis%20Myers%20linked%20to%20burglary%20ring&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=A%20%28likely%20different%29%20Louis%20Myers%20linked%20to%20burglary%20ring&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2025-10-18T17:57:09.000Z,,,1970-01-24T00:00:00.000Z,\"Vallejo_Burglary_Ring_Broken_10_Arrested_1_25_70_Vallejo_Times_Herald_Page_1.jpg (data/media/attvPF1sVql9y0t3V_Vallejo_Burglary_Ring_Broken_10_Arrested_1_25_70_Vallejo_Times_Herald_Page_1.jpg),The_Times_Herald_1970_01_25_2.jpg (data/media/attOhnPcJxebnqwiq_The_Times_Herald_1970_01_25_2.jpg)\",,1,0,0,,,Louis (Louie) Joseph Myers,,Fact,,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2026-02-15T17:19:09.000Z,true,\"Vallejo, CA\",a-likely-different-louis-myers-linked-to-burglary-ring,233,recTTYSydszPzzHmk,,,,\nrec93EVwfpeA0jZLI,Man tries to assassinate Jim Dunbar at KGO headquarters,1973-09-27,,recRxaezAxDJ2dvhC,,,\"recb9DBCgGcF3eXXg,rec0HdeRrjweVWJpE\",,,,,,1973,September,Thursday,,Non-Zodiac Events,1973-09-27T00:00:00.000Z,9/27/1973,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Man%20tries%20to%20assassinate%20Jim%20Dunbar%20at%20KGO%20headquarters&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Man%20tries%20to%20assassinate%20Jim%20Dunbar%20at%20KGO%20headquarters&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2025-10-18T22:13:03.000Z,,,1973-09-27T00:00:00.000Z,\"The_San_Francisco_Examiner_1973_09_27_24.jpg (data/media/attvExCxk5Fz0J3Nk_The_San_Francisco_Examiner_1973_09_27_24.jpg),San_Francisco_Chronicle_1973_09_29_4.jpg (data/media/att1QyVJ59slFu9M0_San_Francisco_Chronicle_1973_09_29_4.jpg)\",,2,0,0,,,\"Jim Dunbar, KGO-TV\",,Fact,,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2026-02-15T17:19:09.000Z,true,KGO-TV Headquarters,man-tries-to-assassinate-jim-dunbar-at-kgo-headquarters,234,rec93EVwfpeA0jZLI,,,,\nreciUigM6gBvGSlbn,\"Suspicious \"\"Aroused\"\" letter to Modesto Bee re: Joe Stine\",1969-11-03,,recDImIEGwECs4V7G,\"\n### Transcription\n**“Very Brave Man”**\n\n_Editor of The Bee — Sir:_ After reading the article _“Modestan Offers To Be Killer’s Victim”_ on the front page of _The Bee_ Oct. 23, I would just like to say Joe Stine is a very brave man.

Context: The letter references an earlier Modesto Bee article where Joe Stine apparently offered himself as a potential victim to the Zodiac Killer, stating he would travel without a weapon and by bicycle.\\n\\n2. Personal Connection: The writer claims to have attended Hughson High School with Paul Stine and expresses grief over his murder.\\n\\n3. Social Commentary: The letter includes a critical digression about Vietnam War protesters, describing them as cowardly and contrasting them with Joe Stine's perceived bravery.\\n\\n4. Community Support: The author proposes starting a fund to buy Joe Stine an automobile for protection, suggesting a donation of $1 per reader.\\n\\n5.

However, the motivations behind the letter remain unclear, and its connection to the Zodiac Killer case is speculative.\"\"}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"errorType\"\": \"\"attachmentImageNotSupported\"\", \"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"error\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2026-02-15T17:19:09.000Z,true,\"Modesto, CA\",suspicious-aroused-letter-to-modesto-bee-re-joe-stine,235,reciUigM6gBvGSlbn,,Media / Legacy,,\nrecioDw6AsD9fQLod,Paul Stine is born,1939-12-12,,recHxnLOUbEDqilva,,,\"recIi4fFkzHRAIpD0,reckGoFwqsrWW0lLk\",,,,,recNDQiiKZS8J0t9h,1939,December,Tuesday,,Victim Event,1939-12-12T00:00:00.000Z,12/12/1939,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Paul%20Stine%20is%20born&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Paul%20Stine%20is%20born&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2025-10-20T03:39:53.000Z,,,1939-12-12T00:00:00.000Z,,,2,0,1,,,\"Paul Lee Stine, Audra Thelma (Busby Stine) Harrison\",,Fact,,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"errorType\"\": \"\"emptyDependency\"\", \"\"isStale\"\": false, \"\"state\"\": \"\"error\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2026-02-15T17:19:09.000Z,true,\"Exeter, CA\",paul-stine-is-born,236,recioDw6AsD9fQLod,,Biographical Details,,\nrecRzzeO1vsCNCb3y,Paul Stine's funeral,1969-10-14,39600,rec85gfZwHdji8FdG,,,\"recIi4fFkzHRAIpD0,recfaGz7ecM0l0K1x,reckGoFwqsrWW0lLk,recLGTCnp86fwjUH4\",,,,recZrWXJRGrAJqWAi,recNDQiiKZS8J0t9h,1969,October,Tuesday,,Victim Event,1969-10-14T11:00:00.000Z,10/14/1969 11:00AM,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Paul%20Stine%27s%20funeral&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Paul%20Stine%27s%20funeral&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2025-10-20T04:02:43.000Z,11:00 AM,,1969-10-14T11:00:00.000Z,,\"Title: Paul Stine's obituary\n\nDate: 1969-10-14T00:00:00.000Z\n\nAuthor / Source: San Francisco Chronicle\n\nOrigin / Postmark: \n\nEvents: Paul Stine cremation, The Murder of Paul Stine in Presidio Heights, Paul Stine's funeral\n\nRelated People / Groups: Paul Lee Stine\n\nTags: Paul Stine's Taxi Murder\n\nLocations: First Unitarian Church (San Francisco)\n\nSource: \n\nText: STINE, Paul Lee — Oct. 11, 1969.\nPaul Lee Stine, husband of Claudia Stine, son of Audra Harrison, brother of Ivadean Killian, Thela Bawden, Geneva Merriott and Carol Hyter; a native of Oklahoma, aged 29 years; graduate student of S.F.

Garrigus, who is seeking to unseat the incumbent assemblyman from the 33rd district.\n\n**THE YOUTHS** will receive $50 a week for 10 weeks. The clearinghouse, with a grant from the Ford Foundation, is providing half the money and the central committees the remainder. Each will work beside his candidate, learning what is involved in political campaigning.\n\nIn a quote from Dr. Karl Falk, head of the college social science division, the boys “will learn how to ring doorbells and make individual vote solicitations, will learn precinct organization work, will learn how speaking engagements are sought and how they are filled and how press releases are prepared.”\n\n“**THE ONLY** requirement is that they get a good cross section of a local political campaign and not be assigned some routine task. A similar program is in effect in Los Angeles County. The two are parts of a pilot program and, if successful, may result in much wider application of the ‘political internship’ arrangement in coming years.”\n\n**BOTH YOUNG** men feel they may enter the political field themselves in the future.\n\nStine, 18 years old and in his first year at F.S.C., will be unable to vote for his candidates in November, but states, “I plan to make up for that, and more, by ardent campaigning.”\n\nHis work is in addition to a part-time job as a dishwasher in a drive-in restaurant, to finance his way through college.\n\nBefore graduating from Hughson Union High School in 1957, Stine worked in the peach harvest and was a sports writer for the school, representing the _Turlock Journal._ Last summer he was employed full time for the _Journal_ as sports editor.\n\",,recIi4fFkzHRAIpD0,,,,,recNDQiiKZS8J0t9h,1959,July,Sunday,,Victim Event,1959-07-19T00:00:00.000Z,7/19/1959,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Paul%20Stine%20interns%20for%20Democratic%20campaign&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Paul%20Stine%20interns%20for%20Democratic%20campaign&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2025-10-20T05:21:56.000Z,,,1959-07-19T00:00:00.000Z,\"Paul_Stine_is_Spending_Summer_in_Politics.jpg (data/media/attUIRU6vOqL8GF9d_Paul_Stine_is_Spending_Summer_in_Politics.jpg),Paul_Stine_Pre_Zodiac_Local_Politics.jpg (data/media/attoJNfyDVO7OhOsq_Paul_Stine_Pre_Zodiac_Local_Politics.jpg)\",,1,0,1,,,Paul Lee Stine,,Fact,,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2026-02-15T17:19:09.000Z,true,\"Turlock, CA, Fresno County, CA\",paul-stine-interns-for-democratic-campaign,241,recbSfWBOh5BtqEPr,,,,\nrecbkiWmOu8n2DmPp,Paul Stine wins Lions Club speech contest,1956-03-05,,recUShJmf1f9rIBQq,\"**Paul Stine Is Contest Winner**\n\n**HUGHSON —** Paul Stine, Hughson High School junior and the son of Mrs. Audra Stine, was the winner in the Lion’s Club speech contest before the meeting of the club Thursday evening.\n\nAlso speaking on the subject _“Youth Problems Tomorrow”_ were Rosalie Lewis and Marlene LeVake.

Deputies discovered a **.380 Beretta** and a **.22 caliber pistol** in the vehicle and charged him with possession of **unregistered firearms**. Because the calibers matched those used in the Zodiac killings, Schilling was briefly detained on a **murder hold** as a potential suspect in the Zodiac case.\nFingerprints and handwriting samples were sent to **San Francisco Police** for comparison, but investigators—including **Inspector Dave Toschi** of the Zodiac task force—quickly expressed skepticism. Toschi described Schilling as “one of about 5,000 suspects who resembled our composite,” adding that “it’s just a routine check. Somebody jumped the gun on this and it’s gotten completely out of hand.”\nOther SFPD officials noted that Schilling’s features did not match the Zodiac composite sketch and that there was “nothing exceptional about this suspect.” Officers emphasized that the similarities in weapon caliber were coincidental and that Schilling did **not** resemble the Zodiac.\nAuthorities confirmed that Schilling was also wanted in **Downey, California**, for a loitering charge. After questioning by Las Vegas detectives, he was released when no connection to the Zodiac murders was found.\n\n////////\n\n**Another False Alarm In Zodiac Case**\nSAN FRANCISCO (UPI) — Homicide investigators said today a man being held in Las Vegas as a possible suspect in the Zodiac murders “doesn’t look like anything that we’re interested in at all.”\nInspector Dave Toschi, one of the team assigned to the Zodiac case, said Gary Ronald Schilling, 27, Los Angeles, was “one of about 5,000 suspects who resembled our composite (picture) of Zodiac that we’ve checked.”\n“We can’t positively rule him out until we receive his fingerprints,” the inspector said. “But it’s just a routine check. Somebody jumped the gun on this and it’s gotten completely out of hand.”\nSchilling was arrested on the Las Vegas Strip Tuesday night for possession of unregistered firearms. He was later booked on a hold for murder as a possible suspect in the five Bay Area killings of recent months.\nToschi said Schilling had been questioned at length about the Zodiac killings by Las Vegas detectives and didn’t seem to be a likely suspect.\nSchilling was arrested when deputies found him sleeping in the back of his car in the parking lot of a hotel. They found a .380 beretta and a .22 caliber pistol in the car.\nFingerprints and handwriting samples were sent to San Francisco police to determine if there is any connection between the man and the so-called Zodiac killer.\nAuthorities in San Francisco have attributed five murders in recent months to a person who has called himself Zodiac in letters to police and newspapers boasting of the murders.\n\n**SUSPECT HAD TWO GUNS**\nAn Inglewood man, who does not resemble the composite sketch of Zodiac, psychotic slayer of five persons, is being checked out as a possible suspect because he had two guns of the same caliber as the ones used by Zodiac, San Francisco police said today.\nThe fingerprint and handwriting comparisons have not yet been completed, an officer said.\nGary Ronald Schilling, 27, was picked up for investigation after Las Vegas police found him sleeping in his car and armed with a .22 caliber pistol and a foreign-make 9 mm. automatic, police reported.\nOne officer indicated skepticism about the case, saying the San Francisco police have checked dozens of similar suspects during their Zodiac investigation. “There’s nothing exceptional about this suspect,” the officer said. “And his features do not match those in the composite drawing.”\nIn discussing Zodiac, the San Francisco officer said that although the murderer is unique in devising the cryptogram and contacting police after his slayings, he is not necessarily a trained cryptographer.\n“He could have gone to any library and gotten a book to help him create the three-part cipher,” the officer said.\n\n**Suspect Said Not Zodiac**\nSAN FRANCISCO (UPI) — Homicide investigators said today a man being held in Las Vegas as a possible suspect in the Zodiac murders “doesn’t look like anything that we’re interested in at all.”\nInspector Dave Toschi, one of the team assigned to the Zodiac case, said Gary Ronald Schilling, 27, Los Angeles, was “one of about 5,000 suspects who resembled our composite (picture) of Zodiac that we’ve checked.”\n“We can’t positively rule him out until we receive his fingerprints,” the inspector said. “But it’s just a routine check.

Vermont, Gardena.\nLos Angeles police said Schilling was also wanted in Downey, Calif., on a loitering charge.\nSchilling was arrested when deputies found him sleeping in the back of his car in the parking lot of a hotel.

Accordingly, I wish to endorse Chief Jack E. Stiltz’ request that the traditional trick or treat activities be discontinued this year, particularly with young children.\n“To quote Chief Jack Stiltz: ‘I realize that in asking for this cooperation from the parents, that many young people who have been looking forward to this annual trick and treat fun will be disappointed. I regret it very much, but I feel that it is too great a risk to take when a killer is at large, such as the Zodiac Killer,’” the superintendent’s notice concluded.\nSeveral days ago, after claiming his fifth victim since last Dec. 20 — four in Solano and Napa counties — Zodiac wrote the San Francisco police department his next target might be a school bus. Accordingly, school buses have been guarded since, on their runs to and from school.\nNo attempts have been made on school buses since the threat.\n\",,\"rechlB2ckHI3rm1um,recEMgXUeSqR0bXpL\",,,,,,1969,October,Thursday,,Case Event,1969-10-30T00:00:00.000Z,10/30/1969,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Children%20urged%20to%20skip%20Trick%20%27R%20Treat&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Children%20urged%20to%20skip%20Trick%20%27R%20Treat&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2025-10-24T02:59:49.000Z,,,1969-10-30T00:00:00.000Z,\"Zodiac_Killer_Halloween.jpg (data/media/attFJatSAT1GYYA3a_Zodiac_Killer_Halloween.jpg),The_Times_Herald_1969_10_30_2.jpg (data/media/atttT6IPeoUZQbeYB_The_Times_Herald_1969_10_30_2.jpg)\",,2,0,0,,,\"Jack E.

The marriage was solemnized on **November 26 at 8 o’clock in the evening** at the **San Marino Congregational Church**, with the **Rev. Bertrand R. Crist** officiating.\n\nThe bride was given in marriage by her grandfather, **Alfred R. Dumas**. Her _lovely_ gown of ivory brocade was designed by Gallina, in a simple A-line with a very full, long train falling from the shoulders. A large bow of the same fabric as the gown framed her face and her veil was of ivory silk illusion in cathedral length. Slippers of ivory satin with rosettes on the toes and wrist-length white kid gloves completed her bridal costume. She carried a presentation bouquet of small white roses.\n\n**Miss Linda Cathcart of Burbank** attended as maid of honor, wearing a gown of gold faille in an A-line design with a panel back.

She wore a cinnamon-toned stole hat and matching shoes and handbag; her corsage was of green orchids.\n\nThe groom’s mother wore a mint-green and orchid brocade jacket ensemble, with a small green satin hat and matching shoes; her flowers were a corsage of bronze cymbidium orchids.\n\nA **reception** followed at the **South Pasadena Women’s Club**, where members of the wedding party and both families greeted guests.

These arrangements were made for him and I to meet in front of the security office in this airport at 10:30 a.m. on 081691. I flew to Ontario Airport, arriving shortly after 10:00 a.m. I met MAGEAU promptly at 10:30 a.m. in front of the security office. MAGEAU was accompanied by an older white female that I would estimate to be in early 60’s. MAGEAU explained that he lived with this female and her husband in the residence in [redacted].\n\nIt should be noted at this time that MAGEAU was the surviving person in the Zodiac Killing which occurred on 070469. I briefly asked MAGEAU about the incident. MAGEAU indicated that he did, in fact, get a view of the responsible’s face. It was a very short duration of time as the responsible had shined a flashlight into his face and almost immediately began shooting him. He then switched the flashlight over to the area where the other person in the vehicle with him, Darlene FERRIN, was seated, and began shooting her. MAGEAU indicated that it was during this span of time that he was able to see the individual who had shot him.\n\n\n\n### **PAGE 2 OF 5**\n\nI advised MAGEAU that I had a group of photographs which I wished to show him, and that the responsible who shot him on July 4, 1969 may or may not be amongst these photographs, and merely because I was showing him pictures, he did not have to identify anyone. MAGEAU indicated he understood this.\n\nI showed MAGEAU a photographic lineup containing six photographs. The fourth photograph to the right in this lineup is that of Arthur Leigh ALLEN. MAGEAU viewed this lineup for approximately 15 or 20 seconds. He then placed his finger on the photograph of Arthur Leigh ALLEN stating, “That’s him.” I asked MAGEAU how sure he was, and he indicated he was pretty sure; that the responsible had a round face like that, and then he pointed to the picture on the right of another individual. The picture he was now pointing to was that of a person whom I could only read the first [redacted]. The lineup is made up primarily of soundex driver’s licenses which have been stapled together, and I do not want to further remove the staples from this lineup at this time to more positively identify this individual.\n\nI asked MAGEAU if he was also identifying this photograph. He emphatically stated “No,” just that the picture also had a round face like that of the picture that he had identified of ALLEN. I asked MAGEAU on a scale of 1–10 how sure he was of his identification of the photograph of ALLEN. MAGEAU stated, “It’s at least an 8. I’m very sure that this is the individual who shot me on July 4, 1969.”\n\n\n\n### **PAGE 3 OF 5**\n\nI then asked MAGEAU if he was shown any other photographs during the investigation of this case. MAGEAU indicated that shortly after the shooting, he was shown a number of photographs which he was unable to identify. He indicates that today is the first time he was shown a photograph wherein he was able to identify a responsible.\n\nMAGEAU also indicated that 8–10 years ago when he was living in the City of Oxnard he was shown some photographs by the Oxnard Police Department and was unable to make an identification at that time. It should be noted that I was responsible for having Oxnard Police Department show a group of photographs to MAGEAU of a suspect that had been developed by the Department of Justice.\n\nMAGEAU was asked if he had heard any of the recent publicity regarding the Zodiac Case. MAGEAU indicated that he had read in a newspaper that a suspect who was a disabled school teacher had been identified as a possible responsible in the Zodiac killings. MAGEAU indicated there was no picture with this article, and he has seen no TV coverage regarding the Zodiac Case recently.\n\nMAGEAU indicates he has never seen the face of the individual he had identified today with the exception on July 4, 1969.\n\n\n\n### **PAGE 4 OF 5**\n\nMAGEAU was then asked if he had ever attended in 1969, a painting party at Darlene FERRIN’S residence. MAGEAU indicated that he had not, but he had heard about this party. He was asked if he knew the name of Ron ALLEN. MAGEAU indicated that name sounded familiar, but he can’t remember for sure. He was then asked if he knew the name of Leigh ALLEN. MAGEAU responded, “I don’t think so.”\n\nMAGEAU was then asked about a lengthy rap sheet which I had obtained from the Department of Justice on him; wherein, he had used approximately 33 aliases. MAGEAU viewed this listed aliases and indicated that he had, in fact, used most of those names. MAGEAU indicated that he had previously been in quite a bit of trouble; that he was now a Born Again Christian and that he attended the First Assembly of God Church as well as the First Baptist Church. And, in fact, the woman with him and her husband were both church members in both of these churches, and they all attended. He was presently residing with this woman and her husband and doing handyman work for them. My impression of MAGEAU at this time that he is sincere in his religious beliefs and has put his lawless past behind him.\n\n\n\n### **PAGE 5 OF 5**\n\nMAGEAU indicated that he would cooperate with this investigation in any way possible. I indicated to MAGEAU that it may be necessary to fly him up to Northern California for a more in-depth interview. He indicated that he would have no objection to doing this. An appointment will be made with MAGEAU for a more in-depth interview.\n\n\n**REPORTING OFFICER:** G.

Jim Overstreet, San Jose P.D., had arrested him as a suspect in at least nine armed robberies of restaurants. Spinelli knew he could be prosecuted as a career criminal. He had been arrested in Oregon in 1972 for a series of armed robberies of restaurants and served two years of a ten-year sentence for them. Facing a thirty-year sentence, he suggested to Overstreet that he had something to trade. In jail, cigarettes, sex, and secrets were three prized commodities. “The best kind of informant is a two-time loser-forty-five to fifty who knows if he goes up one more time he’s going to die in the can,” said a detective. “When he turns to us, he has nowhere else to go—he becomes as zealous as a cop.” The cops had a “twist,” a hammer, on Spinelli and he was “working his beef.”\n\n“I know the real name of Zodiac,” Spinelli said finally. “It was his ace.”\n\nSpinelli began to talk in halting tones and rapid cadence. But for all he said, it was just enough to get Overstreet on the hook. Overstreet realized Spinelli might be inventing a story—a very good chance of that. However, he could not ignore what might be a valid tip. Zodiac was the biggest case there was. He left a message for retired Detective Bawart and Bawart rang him right back. “Spinelli is currently incarcerated in the Santa Clara County jail,” advised Overstreet. “He won’t divulge what information he has regarding Zodiac unless some kind of deal is made regarding the present charges against him.” Bawart sighed. He had heard such claims about Zodiac before. “I’ll get back to you,” he replied, and called Conway.\n\n“There was this guy Spinelli living in San Jose,” Bawart told me later, “pulled a bunch of stickups and they caught him and he said, ‘Get ahold of Vallejo P.D. I’ll tell you all about a case they’re real interested in.’ They called us, and Conway and I went down and interviewed him on his birthday.” Vallejo Police Captain Roy Conway already knew Spinelli. His name had been prominent in the Vallejo area during the forties, fifties, and sixties. Connections with organized crime were suspected.\n\nConway, a Vallejo police officer since 1965, had worked with Mulanax, since retired. He was presently commander of the Investigation Division, but the night Ferrin was murdered and Mageau terribly wounded, he had been a sergeant and he and Richard Hoffman had been the first policemen at the scene. Conway personally verified the authenticity of descriptions Zodiac mailed to the press back in 1969. He believed Zodiac had committed those shootings. An anonymous phone call to the Vallejo P.D. had been made from a phone booth near Arthur Leigh Allen’s home and near where Tucker kept his car.\n\nConway and Bawart drove to the Santa Clara lockup, checked their guns, and went in to see Spinelli. He was being held on $500,000 bail while awaiting trial on the charges. The prisoner was anxious. Spinelli knew how much trouble he was in. Though he could go in for what amounted to life, Spinelli still refused to budge. He would not name the individual he knew as Zodiac without being offered a deal. “I want all charges against me dropped,” he insisted.\n\n“Out of the question,” said Bawart.\n\n“We refuse to make any sort of deal like that,” said Conway.\n\n“And just how do you know this person is Zodiac?” asked Bawart.\n\n“He threatened me several days before the killing of Paul Stine, the San Francisco cabdriver. He wanted to show me how tough he was. He told me he was going to San Francisco and kill a cabbie for me,” said Spinelli. “The next day or so a cabdriver was killed in San Francisco and the Zodiac took credit for it.” A police report confirmed Spinelli and Allen had had fights in the past.\n\nAfter a long discussion, Spinelli agreed to give Zodiac’s true name to his lawyer, Craig Kennedy, a deputy public defender of Santa Clara County. Throughout the remainder of the month, several meetings were held between Kennedy and his immediate boss, Bryan Schechmeister. He refused to agree that no further information would be divulged without a definite deal given to their client. Thus Conway and Bawart still refused to do. They could play hardball too. It would be interesting to see who blinked first.\n\n\n**Thursday, January 31, 1991**\n**Page 2**\n\nConway received a call from Kennedy. “I can give you the name that Spinelli has,” he said. The other side had caved.\n\nConway waited silently, although he already thought he knew the answer.\n\n“It’s Leigh Allen. Arthur Leigh Allen.”\n\nConway let out a slow breath. He already knew all about Lee Allen. He got Bawart on the phone immediately. “LEE” was in the Zodiac cipher. It was the name Allen had worn on his smock at Ace Hardware. Conway contacted Inspector Armstrong in San Francisco. “Yes,” Armstrong said, “one of the primary suspects back in the early 1970s was Arthur Leigh Allen.” He also verified that Allen’s name had never been published in any media to his knowledge. The only persons knowing his name were law enforcement people and only those involved in the actual Zodiac investigation, or someone Allen might have bragged to such as medical personnel at Atascadero and some coworkers at an auto parts store in Sonoma.\n\n“Arthur Leigh Allen and Spinelli were acquaintances way back when,” Bawart told me later, “and he [Allen] approached him and told him he wanted to be an enforcer for him. The guy [Spinelli] owned a topless bar. He admitted he was the Zodiac, said Spinelli, and said, ‘To show you, I’m going to go to San Francisco and kill a guy.’ That was shortly before the Stine killing. Then he supposedly came back and said, ‘I’m responsible for the Stine killing.’ I know this guy Spinelli fairly well from his criminal past. I didn’t know whether to believe him or not.”\n\nSpinelli might have invented his story and been trying to win favor. Even if what he said was true, it was not solid supporting evidence that would hold up in court. It was fruit from a tainted tree. But how had Spinelli known to come up with the name Leigh Allen in the first place?\n\n**Wednesday, February 6, 1991**\n\nConway and Bawart drove to the State Department of Justice, Sacramento Homicide Unit, to see Agent Fred Shirisago. This branch was currently the repository for all the Zodiac cases in the multitude of jurisdictions where the killer had struck. A constant refrain from amateur sleuths regarding the state DOJ was that some at the top level were not always responsive to their information and theories. “They don’t always take my information seriously,” one told me. “Further one guy claimed that the Riverside killing invalidated my material and he had proof Zodiac did not kill Cheri Jo Bates. He claimed the information provided by Pam, Darlene’s sister, was not valid as it was too old. The handprinting I provided by my expert was that ‘it looked similar,’ but after a killing in Martinez, they said it was not Zodiac’s. Yet he refused to allow the other expert, Mr. Morrill, a chance to examine said handprinting.”\n\nThis was not Toschi’s approach. “Just let people know you appreciate getting their clues on how to catch Zodiac,” he told me. “I always acknowledge receipt of a person’s letter, especially if it appears to have some substance or is sincere. I never know when I’ll get a letter that will make or break the case.” Shirisago gave Conway all the reports pertaining to the investigation of Arthur Leigh Allen, records that demonstrated San Francisco detectives, specifically Armstrong and Toschi, had conducted the primary investigation on Allen. They spoke with Armstrong, then Conway contacted Mel Nicolai, now retired. Nicolai agreed with Armstrong that the media had never revealed the name of Lee Allen as a suspect in the Zodiac investigation. Bawart followed the local papers devotedly. He too knew Allen’s name had never been linked publicly with Zodiac. Spinelli had to have had personal contact with Lee Allen or with a close friend of his. In no other way could he have come up with the name.\n\n“Were there any reasons for Spinelli to lie about the information?” I asked Bawart. “A grudge? A lighter sentence of some sort?”\n\n“Allen had gotten in a fight with Spinelli,” he told me. “Showed up at his house and kicked in the door and beat him up. And yes, he provided the information in exchange for a lighter sentence.”\n\nThrough Sacramento, Conway requested the FBI Director’s aid, Teletyping the following:\n\n“The latent fingerprint section is requested to provide Sacramento with photographs of all latent fingerprints developed during the Zodiac investigation, Latent Case No A-10042. The latent fingerprint section is further requested to search the latent fingerprints developed in the Zodiac case through the Automated Identification System and the Automated Latent Systems Model and National Unidentified Latent File. Sacramento is not aware of the requested search as previously being conducted. The photographs of latent prints on file with the Identification Division are being sought at the request of the Vallejo California Police Department, who intends to run the prints, search through the California Department of Justice Automated Latent Prints System [ALPS].”\n\nCompared against every suspect in the Zodiac case, prisoners and military personnel, there was no match. How had Zodiac done it?\n\n\n**Thursday, February 7, 1991**\n\nBawart contacted Larry Ankron, a psychologist for VICAP at Quantico. Ankron knew all about Zodiac. Bawart told him all Armstrong, Toschi, and Mulanax had learned back in 1971, then gave him the information that Spinelli had provided—the name of Arthur Leigh Allen. The bureau, as it turned out, already had a file (their largest single file in the Zodiac case) on this individual. In Ankron’s estimation, Zodiac got his much of his fun from taunting the police and reliving his murders through souvenirs he kept as from the violent acts themselves. “My studies,” he said, “show that persons who commit these types of crimes many times keep souvenirs or trophies from these criminal acts. They will take some type of article from their victims such as identification, pieces of clothing, and so on. This is so they can keep these in a hidden place and relive the incident many times over. They will keep journals and newspaper clippings of the crimes themselves. Those who keep these souvenirs have ingenious hiding places within their residences such as false walls, hidden safes, and so on. Many times these individuals will have a storage place at another location where they keep their souvenirs.”\n\nPossibly Zodiac’s trophies were underwater at a site such as Lake Berryessa or in the walls of a trailer. Ankron believed the killings were still going on, or had gone on until recently. After all, Zodiac said he wasn’t going to write anymore and would make his killings appear as accidents. “The only reason I can find that the murders had stopped,” he said, “is that the man responsible had moved away—although the Zodiac crimes committed elsewhere would be readily identifiable because of his well-known M.O.]. He might have died. Or the police had come very close to apprehending him.” Many who had seen Zodiac or been part of Leigh Allen’s alibi had died mysteriously. A caretaker’s daughter saw Zodiac speeding away from Blue Rock Springs, and died several years after in a car accident. A landlady who could have provided Allen with an alibi perished from a heart attack. Mr. William White, a neighbor [whose son joined the Vallejo] force, had seen Allen return home on the day of the Lake Berryessa murder, and died shortly afterward. Frank Gasser, the raccoon hunter who had peered in the white Impala on Lake Herman Road the night of the murders, perished in a freak accident, dying suddenly two years later when he struck his head on a coffee table.\n\n“You know,” Bawart told me, “when you investigate so many cases you get to be jaded to the degree that you have so many coincidences you just don’t believe in coincidences after a while. Where there’s smoke there’s fire.” He visited Ace Hardware, where Allen had once worked, and contacted Leigh’s coworker George Hieb. An ex-city employee, Hieb had worked at the Corporation Yard for many years. In his retirement he was working at Ace Hardware.\n\n“Do you know Arthur Leigh Allen?” asked Bawart.\n\n“I know him quite well,” said Hieb. “I visit his home almost on a weekly basis.” Though Leigh’s mother had died, he still kept his basement bedroom, though he could have control of the entire house. Hieb too had seen Allen’s guns. “A number of revolvers—I think they’re .22-caliber, and at least one semiautomatic pistol, but I don’t know the caliber.” Because Allen had been arrested by the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Department for molesting a small boy, the suspect was a felon. Consequently, he was not allowed by law to own any of the weapons Hieb had seen. But in the decade that Hieb had known Allen, he had never discussed the Zodiac case with him. That was puzzling. Leigh had discussed it with others, even led people to think in that particular direction. Bawart cautioned Hieb not to mention the visit, then re-interviewed a number of people who had information about Allen. As much current information about the suspect as possible had to be gathered before they confronted him.\n\nNear the detached garage on the northeast side of 32 Fresno Street sat a broken-down blue “General Motors-type” auto. According to Hieb’s information, Allen owned an older black G.M. vehicle. In the driveway were an older-model white Mercedes-Benz and light-blue Volkswagen Karmann Ghia. Allen possessed a white pickup, and Darlene Ferrin had been followed by an American-made white sedan. A silver or ice-blue ’66 Chevy with California plates had been seen at Lake Berryessa the day of the attack.\n\nTo get to the lay of the land, Bawart drove over to 1545 Broadway, where Allen kept a boat and trailer. The location was a single-story residence on the west side of Broadway. To the north of the building stood a detached double-car garage packed with household goods. There were storage areas—places where Allen might have concealed weapons—a large lean-to garage, forty feet long and twenty feet deep, and a second storage area at the rear. George got out. Behind the garage, wind whipped grass in a vacant field. The scent of the Bay was in the air. In the center of the field stretched a twenty-five-foot-long blue and white sailboat on a trailer, partially draped by a blue tarp. Bawart mysteriously lifted the tarp and saw a California state number, NE2375Z. The boat had its small outboard motor on board, which would allow a person to stay at sea for many days at a time. Bawart also observed an open sailboat some ten feet long. “It looked more like a rowboat,” he said. Bawart jotted into his license notebook—09127FB. In writing or registration letters 32 F were possible, so could be 39127FB. He phoned his assistant, his sister-in-law Heidi said, “Allen’s been unemployed and living on the government for three years,” Conway had told him. “He goes diving at his place—likes Cat sailboats.” Bawart decided that in addition to a search similar to Fresno, the police should at least search the sailboat. But the evidence they sought might be sunken somewhere off the coast, beneath blue lake waters, or under the turgid waters of the Delta.\n\",,\"rech3D7sonIMHkOft,recgSRXNEmfZT5Com,recRnU2qlZ8hQDVp5\",,,,,reci68Kc8tcfOciIO,1990,December,Friday,,Case Event,1990-12-14T00:00:00.000Z,12/14/1990,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Ralph%20Spinelli%20claims%20he%20knows%20who%20Zodiac%20was&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Ralph%20Spinelli%20claims%20he%20knows%20who%20Zodiac%20was&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2025-10-26T06:16:05.000Z,,,1990-12-14T00:00:00.000Z,,,3,0,1,,,\"Arthur Leigh Allen, George Bawart, Ralph Spinelli\",,Fact,,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"errorType\"\": \"\"emptyDependency\"\", \"\"isStale\"\": false, \"\"state\"\": \"\"error\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2026-02-15T17:19:09.000Z,true,\"San Jose, CA, Santa Clara County Jail\",ralph-spinelli-claims-he-knows-who-zodiac-was,264,recwcxNeKvutZunIR,,,,\nrecYqr42FdbksghyG,Arthur Leigh Allen competes in Camellia Cup Regatta sailing competition,1970-03-15,,recqZNz1ev1HUrq4X,,,rech3D7sonIMHkOft,,,,,,1970,March,Sunday,,Suspect Event,1970-03-15T00:00:00.000Z,3/15/1970,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Arthur%20Leigh%20Allen%20competes%20in%20Camellia%20Cup%20Regatta%20sailing%20competition&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Arthur%20Leigh%20Allen%20competes%20in%20Camellia%20Cup%20Regatta%20sailing%20competition&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2025-10-26T06:32:34.000Z,,,1970-03-15T00:00:00.000Z,The_Sacramento_Union_1970_03_16_12.jpg (data/media/attP4JvYVf8JdRrGc_The_Sacramento_Union_1970_03_16_12.jpg),,1,0,0,,,Arthur Leigh Allen,,Fact,,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2026-02-15T17:19:09.000Z,true,Folsom Lake State Recreation Area,arthur-leigh-allen-competes-in-camellia-cup-regatta-sailing-competition,265,recYqr42FdbksghyG,,,,\nreccF7qsRM0kbWZ5C,Ralph Spinelli arrested for Portland armed robbery,1971-02-11,,recUJsymsZJwwCLW9,\"**Crazy Horse Saloon Owner Held On Warrant**\n\n**FAIRFIELD** — The owner of the Crazy Horse Saloon in rural Fairfield was arrested Thursday and booked in county jail on a governor’s extradition warrant.\n\nRalph A.

who taunted police and terrorized Northern California with threats of murder, died Wednesday in Vallejo of a heart attack at the age of 58.\n\nIn 1971, attention focused on Arthur Leigh Allen when relatives and friends told police that he was acting erratically and that they feared he might be the sadistic slayer who killed at least six people and perhaps as many as 37 between 1966 and 1974.\n\nIn his book _Zodiac_, former _Chronicle_ editorial cartoonist Robert Graysmith described Allen during that time as “the strongest choice of most detectives” for the Zodiac killer. Graysmith could not be reached for comment yesterday.\n\nFormer San Francisco police detective Dave Toschi said yesterday that Allen was investigated as a suspect in 1971 and his trailer was searched, but there was never enough evidence to file charges against him or any other suspect.\n\nAllen had reportedly told some people that he was the Zodiac killer.\n\n“Mr. Allen was a very, very good suspect,” Toschi said. “We looked into Mr. Allen very closely.”\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Allen was convicted of child-molesting charges and sentenced to prison, said Vallejo Police Captain Roy Conway.\n\nLast year, the Vallejo Police Department searched Allen’s home in Vallejo as part of a follow-up investigation into the unsolved case.\n\n“We found some writings, some pipe bombs, some illegal weapons,” Conway said. “None of it was conclusive.”\n\nConway said Allen, who for many years was unemployed and lived on general assistance, cooperated with police. The officer described Allen as highly intelligent. His interests included diving and Hobie Cat sailboat racing.\n\nConway said there have been as many as 1,000 suspects in the Zodiac killings.\n\nThe killer who called himself “The Zodiac” sent chilling letters with coded clues to newspapers and detectives about a string of murders, which occurred in Vallejo, Lake Berryessa, San Francisco and Riverside.\n\n“It was like he was taunting us and saying, ‘I’m better than you and smarter than you,’” Toschi said. “He actually set out a challenge and said, ‘Catch me if you can.’”\n\nLast year, a Vallejo lawyer held a press conference to announce that his dead brother had been the Zodiac killer. William L. Beeman privately published a two-volume set called _Jack the Zodiac_ in which he wrote that 101 pieces of circumstantial evidence pointed to his brother, Jack Beeman.\n\",,rech3D7sonIMHkOft,https://zodiackiller.com/zodiac-killer-suspect-arthur-leigh-allen/,,,,reci68Kc8tcfOciIO,1992,August,Wednesday,,Suspect Event,1992-08-26T00:00:00.000Z,8/26/1992,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Arthur%20Leigh%20Allen%20dies&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Arthur%20Leigh%20Allen%20dies&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2025-10-26T23:46:14.000Z,,,1992-08-26T00:00:00.000Z,San_Francisco_Chronicle_1992_08_29_16.jpg (data/media/attIuxNCa5Ev5baz1_San_Francisco_Chronicle_1992_08_29_16.jpg),,1,0,1,,,Arthur Leigh Allen,,Fact,,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2026-02-15T17:19:09.000Z,true,\"Vallejo, CA\",arthur-leigh-allen-dies,273,recMRQypyLEGzH4Ey,,,,\nrecDSp7lU4Djc5Gfi,William Beeman Sr. accuses brother Jack,1991-11-01,,recURm55M69p21vYN,\"**Lawyer says: ‘My brother was the Zodiac’ slayer**\n_Vallejo man declares he is ‘absolutely certain’ his dead sibling was notorious killer_\n_Examiner Staff Report_\n\nVALLEJO — A highly respected Vallejo attorney says he is “absolutely certain” his deceased brother was the notorious and boastful Zodiac killer who murdered at least six people in California in the late 1960s.\n\nWilliam Beeman Sr., 70, who has practiced law for 37 years, accused his elder brother, Jack Steadman Beeman — who he said died of emphysema in Arizona in 1984 — during a news conference he held Thursday morning at the Solano County fairgrounds.\n\nBeeman told a throng of reporters he would reveal the killer’s identity only after explaining how he had come to solve the mystery.\n“I will just refer to him as ‘Jack the Zodiac,’” Beeman said.\n\nBeeman then listed some reasons why he believed “Jack” was the Zodiac. These included such things as Jack’s shoe size, his alleged hatred of women, the fact that he’d worn a Timex watch and every month read the latest issue of _True Detective_ magazine, his habit of always misspelling common words, and that he was a devotee of astrology.\n\nBut witnesses also described the Zodiac as being about 5 foot 9 and 145 pounds. Jack Beeman, who repaired televisions and other electric appliances, was over 6 feet tall and more than 200 pounds.\n\nWilliam Beeman conceded his belief is based only on circumstantial evidence he began compiling in 1990 after reading _Zodiac,_ by San Francisco author Robert Graysmith.\n\nAnd Beeman denied that the news conference had anything to do with his recently self-published book titled _Jack._\n\nBeeman said he had not taken his “evidence” to any investigators in Solano County, where three of Zodiac’s murders were committed.\n\nWhile short on conclusions, the event was long on drama. The sister of one of the Zodiac’s victims peered at a picture of Jack Beeman in the book before exclaiming that he looked like a man who once fixed the family’s television set.\n\n“I think there may be something here, but I just don’t know,” said Pam Huckabay, whose sister, Darlene Ferrin, was killed in Vallejo in 1969. “I just want the man who killed my sister brought to justice. I don’t want another book, or another movie.”\n\nThe Zodiac killings in Northern California began in December 1968 when two high school students were fatally gunned down while parked at a lovers lane.\n\nAfter the killings, Zodiac would write to newspapers, bragging about his crimes and boasting he would never be caught.\n\nThe last known letter from the Zodiac came in 1974. He has not been heard from since.\n\",,\"reck7E1blwhslA9ae,recqxHkjSjNgk0Vpt,rec2vccsOHBGNhHqq\",,,,,,1991,November,Friday,,Suspect Event,1991-11-01T00:00:00.000Z,11/1/1991,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=William%20Beeman%20Sr.%20accuses%20brother%20Jack&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=William%20Beeman%20Sr.%20accuses%20brother%20Jack&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2025-10-27T00:00:35.000Z,,,1991-11-01T00:00:00.000Z,\"The_San_Francisco_Examiner_1991_11_01_2.jpg (data/media/attWMFoS4iQ6qCUm7_The_San_Francisco_Examiner_1991_11_01_2.jpg),The_Fresno_Bee_1991_11_01_3.jpg (data/media/attovDpD9kki4DqHy_The_Fresno_Bee_1991_11_01_3.jpg)\",,3,0,0,,,\"Pamela Jean Suennen Huckaby, William Langley Beeman, Jack Steadman Beeman\",,Fact,,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2026-02-15T17:19:09.000Z,true,\"Vallejo, CA\",william-beeman-sr-accuses-brother-jack,274,recDSp7lU4Djc5Gfi,,,,\nrecHz5B2RiT4gcioJ,William Beeman tells Tom Voigt that he's backing off of accusing his brother,1998-04-16,,rec8edd0yvQSGZsH0,\"**April 18, 1998)** William Beeman, who wrote a book several years ago accusing his brother, Jack, of the Zodiac crimes, is backing off his claim.

They had felt he actually killed five persons in attacks in San Francisco, at Lake Berryessa, and around Vallejo, which began with a lovers’ lane ambush murder of two teenagers in December 1968.\n\n\n### **Messages**\n\nHomicide detectives didn’t even tie together these crimes until mid-1969, when Zodiac began corresponding with _The Chronicle_, starting his macabre messages:\n“This is the Zodiac speaking.”\n\nAt the time of Miss Bates’ murder, Zodiac had not yet proclaimed his infamous name. The killing, in spite of certain bizarre circumstances, until now has been considered the work of some rejected school suitor.\n\nThe murder happened this way:\n\nMiss Bates, an honor student, drove her Volkswagen to Riverside City College early on a Sunday evening to draw some books from the school library. She spent 20 minutes selecting them, then returned to the car at 6:10 p.m. with two friends.\n\nShe started the ignition key, stepped on the gas pedal, and heard a coarse grinding noise as the engine wouldn’t catch.\n\n\n### **Passenger**\n\nSuddenly, a man appeared — apparently either a passing stranger or, as some have suspected, the man who had disabled her car.\n\nOther suggested the killer had rigged a nearby streetlight to blink out, sending Miss Bates into darkness as she walked toward a parking lot.\n\nShe and the man talked briefly. Witnesses later said they appeared friendly. She seemed neither frightened nor annoyed.\n\nThen she moved toward the alley beside the library and disappeared into the darkness.\n\nHer body was found at 6:30 a.m. the next morning, sprawled face-down and slashed. Her throat had been cut. She had been stabbed multiple times.\n\nHer lightweight clothing was torn in several places, suggesting a violent struggle. One of her shoes was missing.\n\n\n### **Envelopes**\n\nTwo unstamped envelopes were found outside the Riverside Police Department and the Riverside Press-Enterprise newspaper office about a month later.\n\nEach contained a printed greeting card and a handwritten note beginning, “BATES HAD TO DIE — THERE WILL BE MORE.”\n\nThe letters bore block-printed addresses similar to Zodiac’s later style, including a distinct slant to the left, crossed “7” figures, and peculiar “K” forms.\n\nHandwriting experts compared them with Zodiac’s later letters and declared “unquestionable similarities.”\n\nA third note, found scribbled on a desk at the Riverside City College Library, read in part:\n“SHE WANTED TO DIE. THERE WILL BE MORE.”\n\nExperts believe this may have been the first “confession” letter Zodiac ever wrote.\n\n\n### **Details**\n\nPolice later discovered her car’s ignition coil wire had been pulled loose. Grease smears were found on her clothing, and a man’s Timex wristwatch with a torn band was recovered nearby.\n\nHair samples clutched in her hand showed she fought her killer fiercely.\n\nThere was no sexual molestation.\n\nThe killer left no fingerprints.\n\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nFor years, Riverside police insisted the case was not connected with Zodiac. Captain Cross of the homicide detail told _The Chronicle_ that they once suspected a fellow student who was later cleared.\n\nBut in October 1970, Zodiac sent a letter to _The Chronicle_ hinting that “there’s a murder some of your boys in Riverside can’t solve.”\n\nWithin days, police in Riverside and San Francisco compared files.\n\nThe typewriter used on the 1966 notes matched the type in Zodiac’s known correspondence.\n\nThe similarities in phrasing, handwriting, and method were too strong to ignore.\n\nCaptain Cross and San Francisco Homicide Inspector David Toschi agreed that the Bates murder now “must be seriously considered Zodiac’s first known killing.”\n\n\n### **Car**\n\nAn even more recent connection comes from another woman — Mrs. Kathleen Johns, 23, who says Zodiac tried to murder her and her infant daughter near Modesto last March.\n\nShe told police she was lured into his car by an offer of help after her own had broken down.

Marsh, president of the American Cryptogram Association, and one of the world’s distinguished cryptographers.\n\nA scholarly, soft-voiced professor of mathematics at Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colo., Dr. Marsh told _The Examiner_ today:\n\n“The killer wouldn’t dare—as he has claimed in letters to the newspaper—to reveal his name in a cipher to established cryptogram experts.”\n\n### **Incomplete Truth**\n\n“He has, to quote Edgar Allen Poe, that ‘any cipher devised by man can be solved by man.’”\n\n“Zodiac” has not told the complete truth in his cipher messages to _The Examiner_, _The Chronicle_, and _The Vallejo Times-Herald,_ Marsh suggested.\n\n“Zodiac” has not done this, Marsh suggested, because to tell the complete truth in relation to his name—in cipher code—would lead to his capture.\n\n### **Original Claim**\n\nA modest scholar, Dr. Marsh then laid down this challenge:\n\n“I invite ‘Zodiac’ to send to _The American Cryptogram Association,_ care of Dr. D.C.B. Marsh, president, at 4164 Mt. Golden, Colo., 80401, a cipher code—however complicated—which will, when solved, honestly include his name—for study by myself and my colleagues in the association.”\n\nSince the Dec. 20 night “Zodiac” shot to death the first of five victims—a 16-year-old boy and girl in a lovers’ lane near Vallejo—he has mailed intricate code messages in cipher to _The Examiner,_ _Chronicle,_ and _Times-Herald._\n\nHe claimed, in his original cipher message, that it revealed his identity.\n\nMost of the code was deciphered, subsequently, by Donald G. Harden, a Salinas high school teacher, and his wife.\n\nThat message, as decoded by Harden, began:\n\n“I like killing people because it is so much fun it is more fun than killing wild game.”\n\nBut there were 18 garbled letters at the end—never deciphered.\n\nToday, Dr. Marsh told _The Examiner:_\n\n“That first code was complicated and the man obviously knew what he was doing.”\n\nBut it never, Dr. Marsh said, included the true identity of “Zodiac.”\n\",,\"reckQ2Se5cvoZCWrF,rec8vVQxAKyefczsg,recSSU3Hx8U3H6Lhj\",,,,,\"recTMiG4WfngIFgng,rect44YEtF3jKtHcB\",1969,October,Wednesday,,Media Event,1969-10-22T00:00:00.000Z,10/22/1969,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Dr.%20D.C.B.%20Marsh%20dares%20Zodiac%20to%20reveal%20name&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Dr.%20D.C.B.%20Marsh%20dares%20Zodiac%20to%20reveal%20name&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2025-11-09T18:30:04.000Z,,,1969-10-22T00:00:00.000Z,Marsh_Dares_Zodiac.jpg (data/media/attJpFVrNGlx4AQ6y_Marsh_Dares_Zodiac.jpg),,3,0,2,,,\"San Francisco Examiner, Donald C.

He apparently enjoys taunting police by sending cryptograms about himself and his murders. Authorities have stated publicly they believe the man to be sane. There are those who doubt he is.\n\nThe killer calls himself Zodiac and evidently enjoys reading news of himself in the press as he sends ciphered (coded) messages to that medium. His age is guessed at 35 to 45. Two sketches exist which might be likenesses of the man and authorities have circulated these in hopes of someone spotting him.\n\nZodiac has threatened to flatten the tires of school buses and “pick off the kiddies as they come bounding out.” Either the man did not intend carrying out this threat or police presence aboard school buses scared him off as he did not kill any of the children—yet.\n\nDr. Donald G. B. Marsh, a mathematician at the Colorado School of Mines, has been asked by the San Francisco police department to decipher the cryptograms (coded messages). Dr. Marsh has been in the deciphering game since the age of 16 when his first interest and interest in ciphers first drew him when he first saw the film serial “The Mastermind of Mr. Moto.” He has been a member of the Association for 30 years and estimates approximately 4000 others share his tremendous solution of over 40,000 “crunchy” objects. Since 1954 he has edited the foreign cipher section of the Association’s journal and was elected President of the Association in 1964 and is now serving his second term in that office. Although now he is involved with Zodiac, Dr. Marsh states, “My most pleasant satisfying accomplishment in the field to date has been solving a cipher (written in French) by the fabulous Casanova. So far as I can determine, this chapter will only be enjoyed by the late William Friedman, one of the greatest cryptologists, who, although never published his solution.”\n\nDr. Marsh, a modest man, is probably one of the most highly respected persons living in cryptography. Though he may not boast of his successes, the mere fact that the San Francisco police sought him at all is proof of his esteem and reliability.\n\nThoroughly modest, Dr. Marsh is aware of his capabilities and has issued a challenge to Zodiac to send him a code that would reveal his true identity. Dr. Marsh says he can identify the man by the type of cipher he uses.\n\nThe latest message from Zodiac has yet to be forwarded to Dr. Marsh for study. He speculates that insurance by the police department may delay the transfer of immediate area.\n\nBecause of involvement in many other code deciphering mysteries including one that is as well known as San Francisco police, Dr. Marsh has a special privilege of knowing the mystery killer’s method of encoding. He says that the most important thing to know about a cipherer is his personality.\n\nDuring an interview with Dr. Marsh, he talked about how he became involved with the case.\n\n“On the evening of August 5th, 1969, I received a telephone call from Will Stevens, staff writer of _The San Francisco Examiner._ After introducing himself and asking me if I had heard about the killing, he told me that the killer had taken place in the vicinity of Vallejo, California.”\n\nDuring a long discussion with Will Stevens, he supplied me with the information I had not heard concerning Zodiac. I began my study of the ciphers. Then Stevens told me that Donald Harden and his wife, a school teacher in Salinas, had worked on the ciphers and solved them.”\n\n“I was sent the first cipher which the killer refers to in his messages as ‘This cipher is my name.’”\n\nDr. Marsh explained further that he found the cipher to be “A variation of the Broken Rail Fence,” a form of transposition in which letters of the message are rearranged—but the message remains the same.\n\nMarsh knew the type of mind he was dealing with—practical and systematic.\n\nCopies of the ciphers reached me by mail a few days later and I began a study of them when I was shortly interrupted by another telephone call from San Francisco stating that Donald Harden of Salinas had reported solving the ciphers, saying that the message began, “I like killing people.” I was asked whether or not I could verify his solution. With this lead given me, I was able to recover the message within an hour, arriving at the same solution as Mr. Harden.\n\n“Since this time, the _Examiner_ has very graciously kept me informed of developments in the case (including two further murders) and I have been interviewed and taped by a San Francisco ‘all-news’ radio station and a lieutenant of their Homicide Bureau. Further messages have been received by the police and news media, linking the same man to all five murders, but no further ciphers have been received (or, if received, they have not been released to the public).”\n\n“As submitted to the newspapers, the August ciphers employed various geometric symbols and letters of the alphabet (some reversed, some inverted). The three portions incorporated the same symbols, indicating the likelihood that the same method of encipherment was used in each case. Each section consisted of these symbols neatly printed in 8 x 17 rectangular arrays. When deciphered the three, collectively, composed a single, rather wild, message. The killer did not explicitly reveal his name as promised, but the terminal 18 symbols, when transliterated consistently with the intelligible portion of the message, remain an enigma. They read, ‘E B E O R I E T E M E T H H P I T I.’ They could have been used merely as nulls (symbols to fill in a design, such as the rectangles employed by the writer); they could represent some secondary encipherment which has not yet been discovered; they could be an anagram, although this does not seem to conform with the other portion of the cipher.\n\n“In my opinion, some errors of encipherment, as well as the use of the various symbols rather than simple letters or numbers, indicate that ‘Zodiac,’ as the murderer now refers to himself, is not an experienced cryptographer. Each symbol represents a unique letter of the alphabet, but nearly every letter of the alphabet was assigned more than one symbolic equivalent. These multiple substitutes and the omission of word spaces made the ciphers more difficult than simple substitution ciphers found in many newspapers and puzzle magazines, but it would not require an expert in cryptography to devise either of these complications.”\n\nDr. Marsh is currently working on the latest of Zodiac’s cryptograms which he read in a newspaper. Though he is not a policeman, Dr. Marsh is anxious toward the challenge of decoding the message and of being an aid to the police in bringing the killer to justice.\n\",,\"rec8vVQxAKyefczsg,recgW2ZeMQ6VPyHCi\",Via David Oranchak ag https://forum.zodiackillerciphers.com/community/zodiac-cipher-mailings-discussion/golden-cryptographer-decodes-messages-sent-by-zodiac-killer/,,,,recTMiG4WfngIFgng,1969,November,Friday,,Media Event,1969-11-14T00:00:00.000Z,11/14/1969,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Dr.%20Marsh%20interviewed%20in%20Colorado%20about%20Zodiac%20and%20cryptograms&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Dr.%20Marsh%20interviewed%20in%20Colorado%20about%20Zodiac%20and%20cryptograms&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2025-11-09T19:16:27.000Z,,,1969-11-14T00:00:00.000Z,\"image.png (data/media/attTsFODddZdKjNDs_image.png),image.png (data/media/att9jqivutYtZnqpg_image.png)\",,2,0,1,,,\"Donald C.

A short while later, sometime between 4:30 and 5:00 p.m., friends of Cheri’s drove past the Bates’ house and observed Cheri’s distinctive vehicle still parked in her driveway. In 1966, the RCC library had unusual Sunday hours of operation in that it was open from 1:00 to 5:00 p.m. and again from 6:00 to 9:00 p.m. In other words, the library was closed during the 5 o’clock hour.\n> Another friend thought she saw Cheri heading toward campus in her Volkswagen around 6:15 p.m. 3 Four fellow students who knew Cheri entered the library at about 7:15 p.m. and stayed until closing. None of the four saw Cheri at any point during their time in the library. But at least one of the four had noticed her easily recognizable car parked on Terracina Drive, just outside the library.2,4 In fact, no one interviewed by police could say, definitively, that he or she had seen Cheri in or around the RCC library on the night of her murder. \n> The closest anyone came to confirming Cheri’s presence was an unnamed male librarian who said he “thought he saw” Cheri during the Sunday-evening session.

Collins, chief of detectives, said the girls were fully clothed.\n\n“Both of them were stabbed more than 50 times with a pocket knife in the throat, chest and back. They were not sexually molested. You tell me the motive,” Collins said.\n\nThis morning 14 officers combed the area at the end of Cahalan Avenue, where the bodies were found, looking for some clue. They found footprints and made plaster casts of them.\n\nPolice are also making a house-to-house canvass of the neighborhood to see if they can find anyone who might have seen the girls before they were slain.\n\nApparently the girls were killed somewhere else in the hilltop area and dumped at the spot their bodies were found, Collins said.\n\nThe girls, both students at Oak Grove High School, had left their South San Jose homes about noon to take a picnic. They took sandwiches and a Thermos jug of a fruit drink with them and headed toward a 200-foot hill near their subdivision homes.\n\nWhen they failed to return by 6 p.m., Deborah’s father, Glen Furlong, and Kathy’s parents, Wilfred and Elna Snoozy, b e g a n looking for them.\n\nFurlong, 38, a senior associate engineer at IBM, said he found their bicycles locked by chain to a fence at the bottom of the hill.\n\nAs Furlong and the Snoozy couple were searching for their daughters, they heard of the discovery of the bodies and went to the scene, about two blocks west of Calahan Avenue and three-quarters of a mile south of Blossom Hill Road.\n\nKATHY SNOOZY\n\nThe parents identified the victims as their daughters.\n\nCollins said a horseback rider who spotted the bodies had told a motorcyclist to call police.\n\nThe hill area is a popular spot with cyclists and horsemen, Collins said.\n\nThe picnic jug carried by the girls was found about 25 feet from their bodies. Also nearby was a pair of sandals worn by one of the girls.\n\nDEBORAH FURLONG\n\nCollins said the girls were apparently killed between 2 and 4 p.m.\n\nThe spot where their bodies were found is out of view of the closest homes in the neighborhood where the girls lived.\n\",,\"recXhJcraRKigyqAc,recBvr7GCaKfh1JL0\",,,,,,1969,August,Monday,recRz9p43S8qvk68S,Media Event,1969-08-04T00:00:00.000Z,8/4/1969,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Snoozy%20%2F%20Furlong%20murders%20are%20publicized&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Snoozy%20%2F%20Furlong%20murders%20are%20publicized&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2025-11-17T00:18:22.000Z,,,1969-08-04T00:00:00.000Z,\"The_Peninsula_Times_Tribune_1969_08_04_1.jpg (data/media/attUuXHo3nkCgJ9pm_The_Peninsula_Times_Tribune_1969_08_04_1.jpg),The_Solano_Napa_News_Chronicle_1969_08_04_2.jpg (data/media/attgydkdYAbItZSzZ_The_Solano_Napa_News_Chronicle_1969_08_04_2.jpg),The_San_Francisco_Examiner_1969_08_04_1.jpg (data/media/attIYcYGtcDE8NO20_The_San_Francisco_Examiner_1969_08_04_1.jpg),The_San_Francisco_Examiner_1969_08_04_11.jpg (data/media/attONcI82K531Ogy3_The_San_Francisco_Examiner_1969_08_04_11.jpg)\",,2,0,0,,,\"Kathie Reyne Snoozy, Debra Gaye Furlong\",,Fact,,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2026-02-15T17:19:09.000Z,true,\"San Jose, CA\",snoozy-furlong-murders-are-publicized,287,recYfhOakaNNPgmBe,,,,\nrecd3jmev1n3xECmn,Continued search for Snoozy / Furlong killer,1969-08-05,,reclf44XCEHjVBWFJ,,,\"recXhJcraRKigyqAc,recBvr7GCaKfh1JL0\",,,,,,1969,August,Tuesday,,Media Event,1969-08-05T00:00:00.000Z,8/5/1969,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Continued%20search%20for%20Snoozy%20%2F%20Furlong%20killer&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Continued%20search%20for%20Snoozy%20%2F%20Furlong%20killer&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2025-11-17T00:29:27.000Z,,,1969-08-05T00:00:00.000Z,San_Francisco_Chronicle_1969_08_05_1.jpg (data/media/att63WbjxFF2VaCTo_San_Francisco_Chronicle_1969_08_05_1.jpg),,2,0,0,,,\"Kathie Reyne Snoozy, Debra Gaye Furlong\",,Fact,,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2026-02-15T17:19:09.000Z,true,\"San Jose, CA\",continued-search-for-snoozy-furlong-killer,288,recd3jmev1n3xECmn,,,,\nreci14eBrDklIwDrA,Coroner speaks about Snoozy / Furlong killings,1969-08-06,,reclf44XCEHjVBWFJ,,,\"recBvr7GCaKfh1JL0,recXhJcraRKigyqAc\",,,,,,1969,August,Wednesday,,Media Event,1969-08-06T00:00:00.000Z,8/6/1969,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Coroner%20speaks%20about%20Snoozy%20%2F%20Furlong%20killings&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Coroner%20speaks%20about%20Snoozy%20%2F%20Furlong%20killings&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2025-11-17T00:34:46.000Z,,,1969-08-06T00:00:00.000Z,\"San_Francisco_Chronicle_1969_08_06_1.jpg (data/media/attkHPdUePKL4rufF_San_Francisco_Chronicle_1969_08_06_1.jpg),The_Solano_Napa_News_Chronicle_1969_08_06_2.jpg (data/media/attYDjVnb2XQwyvuz_The_Solano_Napa_News_Chronicle_1969_08_06_2.jpg)\",,2,0,0,,,\"Debra Gaye Furlong, Kathie Reyne Snoozy\",,Fact,,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2026-02-15T17:19:09.000Z,true,\"San Jose, CA\",coroner-speaks-about-snoozy-furlong-killings,289,reci14eBrDklIwDrA,,,,\nrecuLlpHkGvMXeEeQ,Marvin Margolis gets marriage license as M.

Zodiac struck last on October 11 when he gunned down cab -driver Paul Stine on Washington street in Presidio Heights. He revealed himself the killer in a letter sent to The Chronicle three days later. Since then he has remained silent.\nWithout exception, all the investigators assigned to the case feel Zodiac will eventually be caught. \"\"We'll get him,\"\" said one. \"\"We may not know his name at the moment -but we know a lot about him and what we know will finally lead us to him.\"\" Such confidence is based on several factors. There are at least four witnesses who have seen Zodiac when he wasn't wearing the black hood which, like the crossed circle symbol he signs letters with, has become a Zodiac hallmark. There are three persons who have heard his voice.\nThere are samples of his handwriting, and fingerprints found at murder scenes which may be his, and tire tracks, and other evidence authorities won't disclose. Sooner or later, detectives believe, tthey will find a man who matches the killer's descriptions who will be further identified as Zodiac by eyewitnesses, his voice, evidence, and, possibly, by his own admission.\n\",,\"rechZGGRukF60iMfY,rec5NLNj8q2bpKjm8\",https://www.newspapers.com/article/san-francisco-chronicle-cops-no-closer-o/191281534/,,,,,1969,October,Saturday,,Newspaper

\"\"**Part Of Cipher Code Enclosed With Anonymous Letter**\\n\\n**Note Tells Of Killings In Vallejo**\\n\\nA threatening letter written by a person who identified himself as the killer of three young persons in two separate shootings here and demanding publication of a cipher code message was received by Gibson Publications today.\\n\\nAlthough the letter aroused skepticism, it was not completely discounted by authorities and this newspaper. Until proved a hoax, it is being investigated by authorities.\\n\\nThe letter demanded that one-third of the purported cipher code message be printed on the front page this afternoon. Publication of the other two portions was demanded of the two San Francisco newspapers in similar letters.\\n\\n**THREAT TOLD**\\n\\nIf the cipher is not printed, the claimed murderer wrote, \\\"\"I will go on a kill rampage\\\"\" tonight and during the weekend. He threatened to kill more than a dozen people.\\n\\nVallejo Police Chief Jack E. Stiltz said \\\"\"we're not satisfied the letter was written by the murderer, because numerous persons could have learned of the facts. However, it could have been written by the killer. If it is the killer, we would like for him to write more facts to prove it.\\\"\"\\n\\nPolice planned to get a Navy cryptographic expert to examine the cipher, similar to those worked by puzzle fans, to see if it does contain any message. San Francisco police also picked up the other two letters for that purpose. All three were also being checked for fingerprints.\\n\\n**TEXT OF NOTE**\\n\\nThe letter received here reads exactly as written:\\n\\n\\\"\"Dear Editor,\\n\\\"\"I am the killer of the 2 teenagers last Christmas at Lake Herman and the girl last 4th of July. To prove this I shall state some facts which only I & the police know.\\n\\\"\"Christmas\\n\\\"\"1. Brand name of ammo Super X\\n\\\"\"2. 10 shots fired\\n\\\"\"3. Boy was on back feet to car\\n\\\"\"4. Girl was lyeing on right side feet to west\\n\\\"\"4th of July\\n\\\"\"1. Girl was wearing patterned pants\\n\\\"\"2. Boy was also shot in knee\\n\\\"\"3. Brand name of ammo was Western\\n\\\"\"Here is a cyipher or that is part of one. The other 2 parts have been mailed to the S.F. Examiner & the S.F. Chronicle.\\n\\\"\"I want you to print the cipher on your front page by Fry afternoon Aug. 1-69. If you do not do this I will go on a kill rampage Fry night that will last the whole week end. I will cruse around and pick of all stray people or coupples that are aone, then move on to kill some more untill I have killed over a dozen people.\\\"\"\\n\\nThe letter was \\\"\"signed\\\"\" with what appeared to be a sketch of the cross-hairs in a telescopic rifle sight.\\n\\nThe envelope, posted in San Francisco Thursday and carrying 24 cents postage, read \\\"\"Please Rush To Editor\\\"\" on\\n\\nSee LETTER page 2\\n\\n***\\n\\n**LETTER**\\n**From Page 1**\\n\\nboth front and back.\\nIn the cipher were 50 different letters and symbols, most of them repeated from two to seven times in varying, confusing combinations.\\nThe two shootings referred to are the double-slaying of teenagers Betty Lou Jensen, 16, and David Faraday, 17, killed off Lake Herman Road shortly after midnight last Dec. 20, and the murder of Mrs. Darlene Elizabeth Ferrin, 22, and critical wounding of Michael R. Mageau, 19, at Blue Rock Springs Park the night of July 4.\\nPolice and the sheriff's department said the letter was accurate in recounting facts about the shootings. However, it was pointed out they all could have been learned by a person visiting the sites of the crimes afterward, and perhaps also overhearing comments of officers. A number of the facts were printed in the newpaper, contrary to what the letter said.\\nHowever, authorities asked that residents take the letter seriously, pending any determination that it is a hoax. This would mean taking precaustions about driving or walking to lonely spots.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Code Clue by Vallejo 'Killer' Sent Examiner**\\n\\nA man saying he is the killer of three persons in Vallejo has written newspapers in the Bay Area offering them a clue in code.\\n\\nTo prove his authenticity the anonymous letter writer offered what he said were facts known only to him and to the police in the unsolved slayings of Darlene Elizabeth Ferrin, 22, of 930 Monterey St., and Thomas Faraday and Bettilou Jensen, both students at Vallejo High School.\\n\\nVallejo police said that the details in the letter could have been known to persons other than the murderer although officers confirmed that some of the details were not made public.\\n\\nThe slaying of the two high school students occurred Dec. 20.\\n\\n**In Cipher**\\n\\nThe letter named the brand of ammunition — Super X — although this was not disclosed by investigators at the time. He also said that 10 shots were fired and detailed the positions of the body.\\n\\nPolice said that this information, although not made public, was available to anyone who had been at the scene of the crime on Lake Herman Road.\\n\\nThe letter writer also detailed the brand of ammunition used in the Ferrin slaying.\\n\\nHe then offered a clue written in an elaborate cipher with the message split into three parts — one sent to the Vallejo Times, one to the San Francisco Chronicle and one to The Examiner.\\n\\nPolice are working on the cipher but they said that they would not be convinced it had been sent by the murderer unless the letter writer could come up with more details which were not generally known.\\n\\n**Call Made**\\n\\nThe letter to the Examiner was mailed yesterday in San Francisco.\\n\\nOne reason the police are taking the letter more seriously than the usual crank note is that following the Ferrin slaying July 5, a caller notified police of the killing.\\n\\nThe anonymous caller confessed to shooting the woman and said he also had killed the teenagers the preceding Christmas. The call was made 30 minutes after the slaying and before it had become generally known in Vallejo.\\n\\nPolice said that this call seem to fit with the personality of the letter writer. They said they would believe in the authenticity of the letters if more details were disclosed.\"\"}\",2026-02-15T17:19:09.000Z,true,\"San Francisco, Vallejo,

Hospital Thursday, hospital officials said today. Hartnell and a companion, Cecilia Ann Shepard, 22, were stabbed numerous times as they relaxed on the shores of Lake Berryessa two weeks ago tomorrow. Miss Shepard died the following Monday of internal injuries, The hooded killer, who also is linked to three Vallejo murders in the past 10 months, attempted to rob the two, tied them up, stabbed them repeatedly and left them to die without taking the money he had demanded. Hartnell, who had begun fall classes at PUC only three days prior to the attack, returned to the up valley campus Thursday afternoon to resume studies. Meanwhile, Napa County sheriff's deputies and investigators, with the assistance of Napa County district attorney's investigators and state criminologists, are checking out numerous clues to the identity of the attacker in an attempt to locate him before he can strike again.\n\",,recNoik0QhJTMc50o,https://www.newspapers.com/image/563689560/,,,,,1969,October,Thursday,,Victim Event,1969-10-09T00:00:00.000Z,10/9/1969,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Bryan%20Hartnell%20is%20discharged%20from%20hospital&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Bryan%20Hartnell%20is%20discharged%20from%20hospital&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2026-02-17T06:02:06.000Z,,,1969-10-09T00:00:00.000Z,Bryan_Hartnell_leaves_hospital.jpg (data/media/att1y6XXJlsmXKwjR_Bryan_Hartnell_leaves_hospital.jpg),,1,0,0,,,Bryan Calvin Hartnell,,Fact,,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"errorType\"\": \"\"attachmentFailedToExtract\"\", \"\"isStale\"\": false, \"\"state\"\": \"\"error\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2026-02-17T06:08:58.000Z,true,,bryan-hartnell-is-discharged-from-hospital,367,recLsTFzmwRB66QTO,,Immediate Aftermath,,\nrecaMkDBLv6iVqyst,\"Alfred Hitchcock \"\"Museum Piece\"\" episode airs\",1961-04-04,,recO5mW1mFKtK0hCE,\"As noted originally on [ZodiacKillerFacts.com](https://zodiackillerfacts.com/zodiac-theories/zodiac-theories/zodiac-and-alfred-hitchcock-presents/), this episode features a character using a gun with a flashlight attached. It also features a line of dialogue: _“I remember the excitement of the manhunt. The most dangerous game.”_\n\nEpisode description via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock_Presents_season_6):\n\n> Mr. Hollister (Gates) is curator of a small museum that displays trinkets and human remains. He is visited by Newton B. Clovis (McCormick) who claims to be an archaeo-psychologist. They peruse through Hollister's collection before focusing on one particular skeleton, which Hollister said that he knew and who Clovis says was an athlete. Hollister tells him that the museum's collection was made by his son, Ben (Convy), who died after being erroneously convicted of first-degree murder. Clovis determines that Ben was kind and caring. \n> A flashback details how Ben hunted down a [gray fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_fox) in a neighbor's barn while lovers Tim McCaffrey (Gilleran) and his girlfriend (Tompkins) watched. Tim struck Ben down with a pitchfork, and Ben's gun fired when he fell, killing Tim. Hollister was angry that District Attorney Mr. Henshaw (Platt) did nothing to stop the newspaper and the public from predetermining Ben to be guilty of murder. Henshaw used Ben's marksmanship (hitting the eye with every shot) against him while the judge (Meredith) struggled to maintain order in the courtroom and the defense attorney (Bradley) struggled to keep Ben from consistently committing outbursts. Henshaw also refused to help Ben get any leniency on his sentence, and Ben would be dead within two months after losing the will to live. \n> After their discussion of the events, Clovis examines the skeleton's teeth. It is revealed that the modern skeleton in the museum belongs to Henshaw, and Clovis is investigating that murder as a member of the district attorney's office. When Clovis turns away to look at the skeleton, Hollister stabs and kills him. \n> The episode ends as Hollister takes another group on a tour of the museum, this time examining both Henshaw's and Clovis' skeletons.\n\",,,\"ZodiacKillerFacts|https://zodiackillerfacts.com/zodiac-theories/zodiac-theories/zodiac-and-alfred-hitchcock-presents/\n\nWatch|https://www.peacocktv.com/watch-online/tv/alfred-hitchcock-presents/6231083507338548112/seasons/6/episodes/museum-piece-episode-25/a8ec52c1-8c2e-3542-a417-322f5122244c\",,,,rechK4YIown8dQIgo,1961,April,Tuesday,,Cultural Event,1961-04-04T00:00:00.000Z,4/4/1961,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Alfred%20Hitchcock%20%22Museum%20Piece%22%20episode%20airs&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google Image\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Alfred%20Hitchcock%20%22Museum%20Piece%22%20episode%20airs&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,2026-02-20T03:50:12.000Z,,,1961-04-04T00:00:00.000Z,,,0,0,1,,,,,Fact,,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"{\"\"errorType\"\": \"\"emptyDependency\"\", \"\"isStale\"\": false, \"\"state\"\": \"\"error\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2026-02-20T18:32:44.000Z,true,United States of America,alfred-hitchcock-museum-piece-episode-airs,368,recaMkDBLv6iVqyst,,Pre-Crime,,\nrecL6V2jjlEots0Jp,David Fincher's ZODIAC is released,2007-03-02,,recO5mW1mFKtK0hCE,\"Via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac_(film)):\n\n> **_Zodiac_** is a 2007 American [mystery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_film) thriller [crime drama film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_drama_film) directed by [David Fincher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fincher) and written by [James Vanderbilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Vanderbilt), based on the nonfiction books by [Robert Graysmith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Graysmith): _[Zodiac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac_(true_crime_book))_ (1986) and _Zodiac Unmasked_ (2002).

His murder marked a significant turning point in the Zodiac case, as it was the only confirmed Zodiac killing within San Francisco city limits and provided crucial evidence that would define the investigation for decades to come.\\n\\n## Early Life and Background\\n\\nPaul Lee Stine was born on December 18, 1939, in Exeter, California. He was the son of Theodore Milford \\\"\"Teddy\\\"\" Stine (1904-1967) and Audra Thelma Busby Harrison (1912-1988), and stepson of Roy James Harrison (1895-1968). Paul had several siblings, including his brother Joe Charles Stine (1935-1981), sisters Geneva Ann Stine Marriott (1941-2006), Thelma Fletcher, and Carol Lou Irwin.\\n\\n## Education and Career\\n\\nAt the time of his death, Paul was pursuing a Ph.D. in English at San Francisco State College (now San Francisco State University). To support himself through his doctoral studies, he worked multiple jobs: he was a part-time insurance agent and drove a taxi for Yellow Cab Company during night shifts from 9 PM to 5 AM. Paul was described as a dedicated student who worked diligently toward his academic goals while maintaining employment to pay for his education.\\n\\n## Personal Life\\n\\nPaul was married to Claudia S. Stine (née Wescott). Standing 5 feet 9 inches tall, he was known for wearing glasses and was described as a bespectacled young man.\\n\\n## The Murder: October 11, 1969\\n\\nOn the evening of October 11, 1969, Paul was working his regular night shift as a taxi driver when he was hailed by a passenger in front of theaters near the intersection of Mason and Geary Streets in downtown San Francisco. The passenger requested to be taken to Washington and Maple Streets in the affluent Presidio Heights neighborhood. However, for reasons that remain unclear, Paul's taxi ended up one block away at the intersection of Washington and Cherry Streets.\\n\\nAt approximately 9:55 PM, the passenger—later identified as the Zodiac Killer—shot Paul at point-blank range in the back of the head with a 9mm semi-automatic pistol. This weapon was different from those used in previous Zodiac attacks. Three teenage witnesses across the street observed the killer in the front passenger seat of the taxi, searching Paul's pockets and wiping down the interior of the cab before fleeing on foot north on Cherry Street.\\n\\n## The Investigation and Evidence\\n\\nThe witnesses provided a detailed description of the suspect: a white male, 25-30 years old, 5'8\\\"\" to 5'9\\\"\" tall with a stocky build, reddish-brown hair in a crew cut, heavy-rimmed glasses, and dark clothing. Due to a dispatcher error that initially described the suspect as an African American male, two responding patrol officers, Donald Fouke and Eric Zelms, passed a white male walking east on Jackson Street but did not stop him. When the description was corrected, they realized they may have encountered the killer.\\n\\nOfficer Armand Pelissetti discovered bloody fingerprint impressions on the taxi door, which became crucial evidence in the case. The killer had also stolen a portion of Paul's shirt, which would later serve as proof of the crime.\\n\\n## The Zodiac Connection\\n\\nTwo days after the murder, on October 13, 1969, the San Francisco Chronicle received a letter from the Zodiac Killer claiming responsibility for Paul's death. The letter began with the now-infamous phrase \\\"\"This is the Zodiac speaking. I am the murderer of the taxi driver over by Washington & Maple St. last night. To prove this here is a blood stained piece of his shirt\\\"\". The letter also contained the killer's most chilling threat: \\\"\"School children make nice targets I think I shall wipe out a school bus some morning just shoot out the frunt tire + pick off the kiddies as they come bouncing out\\\"\".\\n\\n## Significance in the Zodiac Case\\n\\nPaul Stine's murder was significant for several reasons. It was the Zodiac's only confirmed killing within San Francisco proper, bringing the case to the attention of the San Francisco Police Department. The crime provided the clearest eyewitness descriptions of the killer and yielded physical evidence including fingerprints and the piece of shirt that the Zodiac used to authenticate his letters. The murder also marked the last confirmed Zodiac killing, making Paul Stine the final known victim of one of America's most notorious unidentified serial killers.\\n\\n## Legacy\\n\\nPaul Stine's death at age 29 cut short the life of a promising doctoral student who was working to better himself through education. His murder remains one of the most well-documented Zodiac crimes due to the eyewitness testimony and physical evidence collected at the scene. The case remains open and is still being investigated by the FBI San Francisco Office. Paul's story serves as a reminder of the human cost of the Zodiac's reign of terror and the lives lost to this unsolved case.\\n\\nThe intersection of Washington and Cherry Streets in Presidio Heights, where Paul died, remains largely unchanged from that October night in 1969, serving as a somber reminder of this pivotal moment in criminal history.\\n\\n## Sources\\n\\n- https://www.imdb.com/name/nm10819628/bio/\\n- https://uncovered.com/cases/paul-stine\\n- https://zodiackillerfacts.com/the-crimes/10-11-69-san-francisco/\\n- https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Lone-Zodiac-slaying-in-San-Francisco-4097325.php\"\"}\",2026-01-19T02:44:33.000Z,2025-09-02T22:15:43.000Z,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"recr2O2FNPzPjrHUd,recXWIp8s3P3TAYiu,recioUzi4gjitPDzS,recT4sMRyAv9Sk1zs,recXWIp8s3P3TAYiu,recO5mW1mFKtK0hCE,recioUzi4gjitPDzS,recQ0TtzBMprliXgb\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Sq.

His murder marked a significant turning point in the Zodiac case, as it was the only confirmed Zodiac killing within San Francisco city limits and provided crucial evidence that would define the investigation for decades to come.\n## Early Life and Background\nPaul Lee Stine was born on December 18, 1939, in Exeter, California. He was the son of Theodore Milford \"\"Teddy\"\" Stine (1904-1967) and Audra Thelma Busby Harrison (1912-1988), and stepson of Roy James Harrison (1895-1968). Paul had several siblings, including his brother Joe Charles Stine (1935-1981), sisters Geneva Ann Stine Marriott (1941-2006), Thelma Fletcher, and Carol Lou Irwin.\n## Education and Career\nAt the time of his death, Paul was pursuing a Ph.D. in English at San Francisco State College (now San Francisco State University). To support himself through his doctoral studies, he worked multiple jobs: he was a part-time insurance agent and drove a taxi for Yellow Cab Company during night shifts from 9 PM to 5 AM. Paul was described as a dedicated student who worked diligently toward his academic goals while maintaining employment to pay for his education.\n## Personal Life\nPaul was married to Claudia S. Stine (née Wescott). Standing 5 feet 9 inches tall, he was known for wearing glasses and was described as a bespectacled young man.\n## The Murder: October 11, 1969\nOn the evening of October 11, 1969, Paul was working his regular night shift as a taxi driver when he was hailed by a passenger in front of theaters near the intersection of Mason and Geary Streets in downtown San Francisco. The passenger requested to be taken to Washington and Maple Streets in the affluent Presidio Heights neighborhood. However, for reasons that remain unclear, Paul's taxi ended up one block away at the intersection of Washington and Cherry Streets.\nAt approximately 9:55 PM, the passenger—later identified as the Zodiac Killer—shot Paul at point-blank range in the back of the head with a 9mm semi-automatic pistol. This weapon was different from those used in previous Zodiac attacks. Three teenage witnesses across the street observed the killer in the front passenger seat of the taxi, searching Paul's pockets and wiping down the interior of the cab before fleeing on foot north on Cherry Street.\n## The Investigation and Evidence\nThe witnesses provided a detailed description of the suspect: a white male, 25-30 years old, 5'8\"\" to 5'9\"\" tall with a stocky build, reddish-brown hair in a crew cut, heavy-rimmed glasses, and dark clothing.

When the description was corrected, they realized they may have encountered the killer.\nOfficer Armand Pelissetti discovered bloody fingerprint impressions on the taxi door, which became crucial evidence in the case. The killer had also stolen a portion of Paul's shirt, which would later serve as proof of the crime.\n## The Zodiac Connection\nTwo days after the murder, on October 13, 1969, the San Francisco Chronicle received a letter from the Zodiac Killer claiming responsibility for Paul's death. The letter began with the now-infamous phrase:\n> \"\"This is the Zodiac speaking. I am the murderer of the taxi driver over by Washington & Maple St. last night.

The couple parked on a gravel turnout along Lake Herman Road near Benicia, a well‑known lovers’ lane. \nBetween 11:05 and 11:10 p.m. an unidentified assailant fired at their vehicle and then shot Faraday at close range. As Jensen fled, the attacker chased her and shot her multiple times; she died at the scene ([Zodiac Killer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac_Killer#:~:text=Lake%20Herman%20Road%20murders)). The murders shocked the Bay Area and were later claimed by the Zodiac Killer in his letters. Jensen’s death marked the beginning of a still-unsolved series of killings that terrorized Northern California in the late 1960s.\n\",\"recsAnCpUh5zZk4oe,recZ9cSElDMDrGudg,recUl2m9gaZj7v8sd\",1968-12-20,\"https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/19133659/betty\\_lou-jensen, https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/MD39-NDS/betty-lou-jensen-1952-1968, https://www.shadowofthezodiac.com/victims/lake-herman-rd/, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac\\_Killer\n\",,\"reclGDjt5ghvv8yaO,rece50yKSif6qIJjD\",\"rece50yKSif6qIJjD,reclGDjt5ghvv8yaO\",,,,,,\nrecYHJNyDqDUFw0ry,David Arthur Faraday,\"Canonical Victim,Deceased,Key Figure\",image.png (data/media/attLGDsgoXF69qADS_image.png),recR0NFmznLOB0Nf6,\"recGTyY8JqkRkfuA0,recI3BVhR2QMDqJ8z,recqTdrmyCAe5tM3S,recAHrz1MtGUe5e7l,rec6bkK6UFkoMfgd9,reclaHGQhThXyQ5X6,recukSymc2t0yDhYU\",\"recgJKENPX5dM7i8f,recCuyJknyUHz9wAm,recx0Q2TFdIt3ZJ6N,recBEk4S1Y1NEAXt5,rec7WIFYPqtLGn25K,recWGfBT7mjqCQGXJ,rec9Ova6sFyt8OeiW,recY30vt5lwc34Ce7\",1951-10-02,8,\"rec9eYWhCQCUgaGyg,recnj8BxYL6vvr1le,recUj2059oNqhpwf7,rec9eYWhCQCUgaGyg,recVhDHtgVjKdjAY6,recNWyymlpM7vhtCj,recsAnCpUh5zZk4oe,rec5A1IAX1TN6Tn51,recUj2059oNqhpwf7\",\"rec9eYWhCQCUgaGyg,recaz1wgcaqz0EFiQ,recURm55M69p21vYN,recioUzi4gjitPDzS,recT4sMRyAv9Sk1zs,recO5mW1mFKtK0hCE,rec3eW7QMV2VW7WE0,recbUCZ2JH938DGoQ,recNWyymlpM7vhtCj,rec5A1IAX1TN6Tn51,reckHGEdCfWzbM8L6\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=David%20Arthur%20Faraday&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Image Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=David%20Arthur%20Faraday&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,recCs9HOkkGQq8s6R,Male victim in Lake Herman Road crime.,,48.666666666666664,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"generated\"\", \"\"value\"\": \"\"# David Arthur Faraday: Biography\\n\\n## Early Life and Background\\n\\nDavid Arthur Faraday was born on October 2, 1951, in San Rafael, California.

The son of a local pest‑control businessman, Mageau grew up in Vallejo and was living an unremarkable teenage life in the summer of 1969 ([thecinemaholic.com](https://thecinemaholic.com/michael-mageau/#:~:text=Friend%E2%80%99s%20Car%20Michael%20Renault%20Mageau%2C,a%20moment%20before%20driving%20away)). On the evening of July 4 1969 he met 22‑year‑old waitress Darlene Ferrin, a friend with whom he had been spending time; they drove to Blue Rock Springs Park, a popular lovers’ lane near Vallejo. A car pulled into the parking lot, left briefly and returned. Thinking it might be a police officer, Mageau and Ferrin searched for identification. Instead, the driver approached with a flashlight and opened fire with a 9‑mm handgun, striking both occupants multiple times ([thecinemaholic.com](https://thecinemaholic.com/michael-mageau/)). The attacker briefly walked away but, hearing Mageau’s groans, returned to shoot both victims again before fleeing. Ferrin died en route to hospital, while the 19‑year‑old Mageau survived despite four bullet wounds and severe injuries ([allthatsinteresting.com](https://allthatsinteresting.com/zodiac-killer-victims/2#:~:text=July%204%2C%201969%20%E2%80%94%C2%A0more%20than,around%205%E2%80%998%E2%80%B3%2C%20with%20a%20round)). Minutes later, an anonymous caller claiming to be the shooter telephoned Vallejo police to report the crime and to link it to the December 1968 Lake Herman Road murders.\nRecovering from his wounds, Mageau provided investigators with a description of the assailant: a white man around 5 feet 8 inches tall with a stocky build, round face and brown hair ([allthatsinteresting.com](https://allthatsinteresting.com/zodiac-killer-victims/2)). In 1991 he tentatively identified photo line‑ups of Arthur Leigh Allen as resembling the shooter, though he admitted his memory was limited and police never substantiated the identification ([thecinemaholic.com](https://thecinemaholic.com/michael-mageau/#:~:text=out%20of%20the%20public%20eye%2C,arrest%20based%20solely%20on%20his)). Mageau avoided publicity for decades, struggling with the trauma of the attack; he made occasional appearances in documentaries and true‑crime programs and served as a consultant for David Fincher’s 2007 film _Zodiac_ ([thecinemaholic.com](https://thecinemaholic.com/michael-mageau/#:~:text=out%20of%20the%20public%20eye%2C,much%20is%20known%20about%20his)). His current whereabouts remain private, and he has not publicly endorsed any particular suspect theory. Mageau’s account remains one of the few first‑hand descriptions of the Zodiac killer and continues to inform both official investigations and independent research.\n\",\"recfV4TBVUDF2meHW,recURm55M69p21vYN,reci6AEROfRm75Mbp,recZOqh0TryCoQP8I,recotyWxs2Vs7TmvA\",,\"The Cinemaholic – Shivangi Sinha, “Michael Mageau: What Happened to the Zodiac Survivor?” (Oct. 24, 2024); All That’s Interesting – Kaleena Fraga, “Inside the Tragic Stories of the Zodiac Killer’s Victims — And the Mystery of How Many People He Murdered” (Oct. 13, 2025).\n\",\"reco8oEDAUmCPTKut,recc5iJIGzONn2DHv\",\"reclKt4S2kN1FZUGr,recjFSh5jxnAJq8AP,rec0dOwJ1AL9UguKQ\",\"reclKt4S2kN1FZUGr,recjFSh5jxnAJq8AP,rec0dOwJ1AL9UguKQ\",\"Address\t26483 9th St\nResidence Place\tHighland, California, USA\nZip Code\t92346-3408\n\nResidence Date\t1995\nAddress\t26780 Hillview St\nResidence\tHighland, California, USA\nPostal Code\t92346\nSecond Residence Date\t1994\nSecond Address\t31196 Corte Talvera\nSecond Residence\tTemecula, California, USA\nSecond Postal Code\t92592\nThird Residence Date\t1993\nThird Address\t160 E Court St\nThird Residence\tTemecula, California, USA\nThird Postal Code\t92589\nFourth Address\t160 E CT\nFourth Residence\tTemecula, California, USA\nFourth Postal Code\t92589\n\",,,,,\nrecUo1Le1hDtuiGV0,,\"Canonical Victim,Deceased,Key Figure\",\"image.png (data/media/att7pGerqQszwl3mS_image.png),image.png (data/media/attIydgYd5A3uytQO_image.png),image.png (data/media/attZ8LlYPgAfg3DDZ_image.png),image.png (data/media/attXx2bnb72y7oVT6_image.png),image.png (data/media/attygVbWKZGynxun8_image.png)\",recguCeqiWgWqR24q,\"recPZFTzBVdRuPu86,recuwj8s2c686PIHY,recQfDH2pVSxIDCUc,recEWEc7hKFiZFBDI\",\"recuOuUGfQpwjuGqq,recmQK2TtG43z2t8t,recgg6pxV9DLvTKz3,reccmPjGjzF5yyh8P,reckvBioQsuv7OI2e,reclS4gm0ZetCaNPF,rechIqE7sbnT374eP\",1947-01-01,7,\"recGa0aCpwMM0jQkt,recxuIuPaJDKhXKo6,reccno8wWTHdS0Go6,rec3tzI60Yod5UPCb,recyvZIPrkhBj44Ei,recHj1mWhEgPtsBK6,recHj1mWhEgPtsBK6,recyvZIPrkhBj44Ei,rec8L6unXxCkFUUnl,recJ147YEAumXAhdU\",\"recGa0aCpwMM0jQkt,recEKYdzhHISXUYQt,rec4uzkCoOurp4K2R,recT2ynH7gNXP8Siv,recrwMyU669yUfeBS,recFIFNtN1IcHq8FW,recHA4DDJVtmmW5qa,recioUzi4gjitPDzS,recO5mW1mFKtK0hCE,recT4sMRyAv9Sk1zs\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Cecelia%20Ann%20Shepard&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Image Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Cecelia%20Ann%20Shepard&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,Female victim in Lake Berryessa stabbings.,,48.333333333333336,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2026-02-21T16:43:35.000Z,2025-09-03T00:02:19.000Z,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"recEKYdzhHISXUYQt,rec4uzkCoOurp4K2R,recioUzi4gjitPDzS,recT4sMRyAv9Sk1zs,recrwMyU669yUfeBS,recioUzi4gjitPDzS,recHA4DDJVtmmW5qa,recioUzi4gjitPDzS,recO5mW1mFKtK0hCE,recioUzi4gjitPDzS\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Sq.

While driving north to visit family, her car pulled over near Modesto, California when a stranger warned her that a wheel was loose. After he tinkered with the wheel it came off as she resumed driving. The man then offered her and her ten‑month‑old daughter a ride. Instead of taking them to a garage he drove around rural roads for two hours, making threats that he would kill them and throw the baby out of the vehicle ([www.aetv.com](https://www.aetv.com/articles/zodiac-killer#:~:text=March%201970%2C%20Kathleen%20Johns%2C%20who,letters%20and%20crimes%20have%20been), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_kidnappings%3A_1970%E2%80%931979#:~:text=22%20March%201970Kathleen%20Johns%20,1)). Johns eventually leapt from the moving car with her child, hid in a field and later reached the Patterson police. She later recognized a composite sketch of the Zodiac and a July 1970 letter from the self‑styled serial killer claimed credit for abducting “a woman + her baby,” but law‑enforcement never conclusively linked the abduction to the Zodiac murders ([www.aetv.com](https://www.aetv.com/articles/zodiac-killer#:~:text=March%201970%2C%20Kathleen%20Johns%2C%20who,letters%20and%20crimes%20have%20been), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_kidnappings%3A_1970%E2%80%931979#:~:text=22%20March%201970Kathleen%20Johns%20,1)).

It traces its roots to January 16, 1865, when teenage brothers Charles and M. H. de Young founded the paper as the Daily Dramatic Chronicle. It adopted its current name in 1869 and, as San Francisco grew, the Chronicle became one of the largest newspapers on the West Coast by the 1880s ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle#:~:text=The%20San%20Francisco%20Chronicle%20is,the%20%2085%20by%201880)). Now owned by Hearst Communications, the broadsheet remains the dominant daily newspaper in San Francisco.\nThe Chronicle is inextricably linked to the Zodiac case because the killer used the newspaper as his main conduit to the public. On July 31 1969, a letter arrived at the Chronicle in which a person claimed responsibility for the Lake Herman Road and Blue Rock Springs murders and enclosed a portion of a cipher; the other two parts were mailed to the Vallejo Times‑Herald and the San Francisco Examiner. Over the next several years the killer sent a string of taunting letters, cards and cryptograms to newspapers — 17 of the 22 known communications were delivered to the Chronicle ([www.sfchronicle.com](https://www.sfchronicle.com/nation/article/zodiac-killer-case-how-the-san-francisco-13464935.php#:~:text=Zodiac%20Letter%20The%20Chronicle%20One,Zodiac%20Killer)). Among them were a letter containing part of taxi driver Paul Stine’s shirt, and a Halloween card that threatened Chronicle reporter Paul Avery. The Chronicle published many of these communications and played a central role in reporting on the case, but there is no evidence that anyone at the paper had any connection to the crimes; its involvement was as a journalistic intermediary between the killer and the public.\n\",recXWIp8s3P3TAYiu,,,,,,,\"recISBXi2eQAIWEO8,recWUh14ApimVUpmt,recyPBK4PgY3QeAgn\",,,San Francisco Chronicle,\nrec4ZhSZpZfgCU6ng,,\"Possible Victim,Deceased,Key Figure\",image.png (data/media/attMn6trGXYcRbNdx_image.png),recwxwoDT5hxnv9eo,recjTEYvHV3sKiOm3,\"recygMQrhavJKZ2Qz,recMWZ6w3JJmVXsmd,recUglzi449My3zuL,recx232Yd4vQml60O,reciftflcnfzSgVzi\",1966-10-30,5,\"recT2ynH7gNXP8Siv,recT2ynH7gNXP8Siv,recT2ynH7gNXP8Siv,recXWIp8s3P3TAYiu,rec6evH12LhXgAkIW\",\"recT2ynH7gNXP8Siv,recrwMyU669yUfeBS,recioUzi4gjitPDzS,recO5mW1mFKtK0hCE\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Cheri%20Jo%20Bates&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Image Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Cheri%20Jo%20Bates&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,Murder victim linked to Zodiac.,,35.666666666666664,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"generated\"\", \"\"value\"\": \"\"Based on my research, here is a comprehensive biography of Cheri Jo Bates:\\n\\n---\\n\\n**CHERI JO BATES**\\n\\n**Biographical Information:**\\n\\nCheri Josephine Bates was born on February 4, 1948, in Omaha, Nebraska, to Joseph and Irene (née Karolevitz) Bates. She was the younger of two children; her older brother Michael served in the United States Navy. In 1957, the Bates family relocated to California, where her father found employment as a machinist at the Corona Naval Ordnance Laboratory. The family settled in Riverside, California, where Cheri would spend her formative years.\\n\\nCheri was a graduate of Ramona High School in Riverside, where she distinguished herself as a varsity cheerleader, active participant in student government, and honor student. Described by acquaintances as a \\\"\"sweet, outgoing girl,\\\"\" she aspired to become a flight attendant. Following her high school graduation, Bates enrolled at Riverside City College (RCC) and found part-time employment at the Riverside National Bank. Her savings and wages from this employment helped her purchase a 1960 lime green Volkswagen Beetle, a vehicle she was proud to own. Her parents divorced in 1965, and she lived with her father at 4195 Via San Jose in Riverside.\\n\\n**The Murder:**\\n\\nOn October 30, 1966, the 18-year-old college freshman was murdered on the grounds of Riverside City College. That morning, Bates and her father attended Sunday Mass at St. Catherine of Alexandria Catholic Church before sharing breakfast at a local restaurant. In the early afternoon, she decided to visit the college library to study and work on a research paper. She left a note for her father on the family refrigerator reading: \\\"\"Dad—Went to RCC Library\\\"\". She is believed to have departed for the library between 4:30 and 5:00 p.m.\\n\\nAccording to eyewitnesses, Bates studied in the library until its normal closing time of 9:00 p.m. When she returned to her vehicle, police determined that an assailant had disabled the ignition wiring and distributor of her Volkswagen Beetle as a method to lure her from her car. Her body was discovered at approximately 6:28 a.m. on October 31, 1966, by a groundskeeper named Cleophus Martin. She was found on a gravel path between two unoccupied houses on Terracina Drive, close to the library parking lot.\\n\\nThe autopsy revealed that Bates had been repeatedly stabbed in the chest and left shoulder, and suffered several deep slash wounds to her face and neck that severed her jugular vein and larynx, nearly decapitating her. She had also been repeatedly kicked in the head. Evidence at the crime scene indicated a ferocious physical struggle; Bates had scratched her assailant's arms, face, and head, and torn off his wristwatch. Fragments of skin and brown hair were recovered from beneath her fingernails. She had not been subjected to sexual assault or robbery. Investigators determined she was most likely murdered at approximately 10:15 p.m.\\n\\nOn November 4, 1966, Bates was laid to rest at Crestlawn Memorial Park in Riverside, with her parents, older brother, and several hundred mourners in attendance.\\n\\n**Related Events:**\\n\\n**The Confession Letters (November 29, 1966):** One month after Bates's murder, two identical typewritten letters arrived at Riverside Police Department headquarters and the editorial offices of the Riverside Press-Enterprise. The author described in detail how he had disabled Bates's car and lured her away before attacking her. The letters included details of the murder that had not been released to the press, leading investigators to initially believe the author may have been the actual murderer.\\n\\n**The Desktop Poem (Discovered 1967):** Six months after the murder, a custodian discovered a macabre poem scratched into the underside of a foldable desk in the RCC library. Titled \\\"\"Sick of living/unwilling to die,\\\"\" the poem contained graphic references to repeated assaults upon young women with a bladed weapon. The poem's language and handwriting resembled that of later Zodiac Killer letters, and it was signed with what appeared to be lowercase initials (r h).\\n\\n**\\\"\"Bates Had to Die\\\"\" Letters (April 30, 1967):** On April 30, 1967, the Riverside Police Department, the Press-Enterprise, and Bates's father received handwritten letters from an unknown individual with the message \\\"\"Bates had to die. There will be more\\\"\". At the bottom of each letter was an indecipherable number or letter that was either a \\\"\"2\\\"\" or a \\\"\"Z\\\"\". In August 2021, the Riverside Police Department announced that the author of these letters had been identified via DNA analysis in 2020 and had admitted to writing the correspondence as a distasteful hoax when he was a troubled teenager.\\n\\n**Connection to the Zodiac Killer:**\\n\\nBates has been hypothesized by some investigators to have been an early victim—perhaps even the first—of the unidentified serial killer known as the Zodiac Killer, who was active in Northern California from the late 1960s to the early 1970s. In November 1970, San Francisco Chronicle journalist Paul Avery received an anonymous letter informing him of similarities between the Zodiac murders and Bates's murder. Handwriting expert Sherwood Morrill stated that the handwriting on the RCC desk and the 1967 letters were \\\"\"unquestionably\\\"\" written by the same individual who had written the Zodiac letters.\\n\\nIn a letter dated March 13, 1971, the Zodiac claimed responsibility for Bates's murder to the Los Angeles Times, stating: \\\"\"I do have to give [the police] credit for stumbling across my Riverside activity, but they are only finding the easy ones\\\"\". However, the Riverside Police Department has consistently maintained that there is no evidence linking Bates's killing to the later Zodiac murders and strongly believes her murderer was native to Riverside County.\\n\\n**Current Status:**\\n\\nThe murder of Cheri Jo Bates remains officially unsolved and is one of Riverside's most infamous cold cases. A 2016 Press-Enterprise article reported that the Riverside Police Department strongly believes they know the identity of Bates's murderer but have never been able to obtain sufficient evidence to arrest and charge this individual.

In 1957, the Bates family relocated to California, where her father found employment as a machinist at the Corona Naval Ordnance Laboratory. The family settled in Riverside, California, where Cheri would spend her formative years.\\n\\nCheri was a graduate of Ramona High School in Riverside, where she distinguished herself as a varsity cheerleader, active participant in student government, and honor student. Described by acquaintances as a \\\"\"sweet, outgoing girl,\\\"\" she aspired to become a flight attendant. Following her high school graduation, Bates enrolled at Riverside City College (RCC) and found part-time employment at the Riverside National Bank. Her savings and wages from this employment helped her purchase a 1960 lime green Volkswagen Beetle, a vehicle she was proud to own. Her parents divorced in 1965, and she lived with her father at 4195 Via San Jose in Riverside.\\n\\n**The Murder:**\\n\\nOn October 30, 1966, the 18-year-old college freshman was murdered on the grounds of Riverside City College. That morning, Bates and her father attended Sunday Mass at St. Catherine of Alexandria Catholic Church before sharing breakfast at a local restaurant. In the early afternoon, she decided to visit the college library to study and work on a research paper. She left a note for her father on the family refrigerator reading: \\\"\"Dad—Went to RCC Library\\\"\". She is believed to have departed for the library between 4:30 and 5:00 p.m.\\n\\nAccording to eyewitnesses, Bates studied in the library until its normal closing time of 9:00 p.m. When she returned to her vehicle, police determined that an assailant had disabled the ignition wiring and distributor of her Volkswagen Beetle as a method to lure her from her car. Her body was discovered at approximately 6:28 a.m. on October 31, 1966, by a groundskeeper named Cleophus Martin. She was found on a gravel path between two unoccupied houses on Terracina Drive, close to the library parking lot.\\n\\nThe autopsy revealed that Bates had been repeatedly stabbed in the chest and left shoulder, and suffered several deep slash wounds to her face and neck that severed her jugular vein and larynx, nearly decapitating her. She had also been repeatedly kicked in the head. Evidence at the crime scene indicated a ferocious physical struggle; Bates had scratched her assailant's arms, face, and head, and torn off his wristwatch. Fragments of skin and brown hair were recovered from beneath her fingernails. She had not been subjected to sexual assault or robbery. Investigators determined she was most likely murdered at approximately 10:15 p.m.\\n\\nOn November 4, 1966, Bates was laid to rest at Crestlawn Memorial Park in Riverside, with her parents, older brother, and several hundred mourners in attendance.\\n\\n**Related Events:**\\n\\n**The Confession Letters (November 29, 1966):** One month after Bates's murder, two identical typewritten letters arrived at Riverside Police Department headquarters and the editorial offices of the Riverside Press-Enterprise. The author described in detail how he had disabled Bates's car and lured her away before attacking her. The letters included details of the murder that had not been released to the press, leading investigators to initially believe the author may have been the actual murderer.\\n\\n**The Desktop Poem (Discovered 1967):** Six months after the murder, a custodian discovered a macabre poem scratched into the underside of a foldable desk in the RCC library. Titled \\\"\"Sick of living/unwilling to die,\\\"\" the poem contained graphic references to repeated assaults upon young women with a bladed weapon. The poem's language and handwriting resembled that of later Zodiac Killer letters, and it was signed with what appeared to be lowercase initials (r h).\\n\\n**\\\"\"Bates Had to Die\\\"\" Letters (April 30, 1967):** On April 30, 1967, the Riverside Police Department, the Press-Enterprise, and Bates's father received handwritten letters from an unknown individual with the message \\\"\"Bates had to die. There will be more\\\"\". At the bottom of each letter was an indecipherable number or letter that was either a \\\"\"2\\\"\" or a \\\"\"Z\\\"\". In August 2021, the Riverside Police Department announced that the author of these letters had been identified via DNA analysis in 2020 and had admitted to writing the correspondence as a distasteful hoax when he was a troubled teenager.\\n\\n**Connection to the Zodiac Killer:**\\n\\nBates has been hypothesized by some investigators to have been an early victim—perhaps even the first—of the unidentified serial killer known as the Zodiac Killer, who was active in Northern California from the late 1960s to the early 1970s. In November 1970, San Francisco Chronicle journalist Paul Avery received an anonymous letter informing him of similarities between the Zodiac murders and Bates's murder. Handwriting expert Sherwood Morrill stated that the handwriting on the RCC desk and the 1967 letters were \\\"\"unquestionably\\\"\" written by the same individual who had written the Zodiac letters.\\n\\nIn a letter dated March 13, 1971, the Zodiac claimed responsibility for Bates's murder to the Los Angeles Times, stating: \\\"\"I do have to give [the police] credit for stumbling across my Riverside activity, but they are only finding the easy ones\\\"\". However, the Riverside Police Department has consistently maintained that there is no evidence linking Bates's killing to the later Zodiac murders and strongly believes her murderer was native to Riverside County.\\n\\n**Current Status:**\\n\\nThe murder of Cheri Jo Bates remains officially unsolved and is one of Riverside's most infamous cold cases. A 2016 Press-Enterprise article reported that the Riverside Police Department strongly believes they know the identity of Bates's murderer but have never been able to obtain sufficient evidence to arrest and charge this individual. DNA profiling determined that her murderer was a Caucasian male.\\n\\n**Legacy:**\\n\\nFollowing the murder, Bates's family established The Cheri Jo Bates Memorial Endowed Scholarship at Riverside City College, awarded to students active in school projects who demonstrate financial need, undertake volunteer work, and major in music with at least a B grade average.\"\"}\",\"recrwMyU669yUfeBS,recioUzi4gjitPDzS,recO5mW1mFKtK0hCE\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Sq.

Investigators later concluded that someone disabled the ignition and distributor of her Volkswagen, luring her away from her car. Early on the morning of October 31 her body was found in an alley near the library; she had been stabbed multiple times and her throat had been slashed, but she had not been robbed or sexually assaulted ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Cheri_Jo_Bates#:~:text=The%20murder%20of%20Cheri%20Jo,brought%20attention%20to%20the%20cold), [www.zodiackiller.com](https://www.zodiackiller.com/Bates.html#:~:text=%28Mon.%29%20Case%20number%3A%20352,from%20the%20attacker%27s%20wrist%20during)). Months later anonymous letters and a poem claimed responsibility for the murder, and in 1971 an individual signing himself “the Zodiac” also claimed it. Some researchers have speculated that the crime was the Zodiac killer’s first attack, but the Riverside Police Department has maintained that there is no evidence linking the murder to the Zodiac and believes the perpetrator was a local person ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Cheri_Jo_Bates#:~:text=The%20murder%20of%20Cheri%20Jo,brought%20attention%20to%20the%20cold)).

He moved to the homicide detail in 1966 and served there through the 1970s.\n\\- Known for a dapper style (bow ties, quick-draw shoulder holster), he gained a reputation as a persistent, by‑the‑book investigator.\n\nRole in the Zodiac case\n\\- Assigned to the Zodiac investigation after the Oct. 11, 1969 murder of Paul Stine in San Francisco; he and partner Bill Armstrong became the SFPD leads on the case and coordinated with neighboring agencies including Vallejo PD.\n\\- July–August 1971: Investigators met and then interviewed suspect Arthur Leigh Allen. On July 27, 1971, Vallejo Det. Jack Mulanax met with SFPD Inspectors Toschi and Armstrong in Vallejo to coordinate; on August 4, 1971, Mulanax, Toschi, and Armstrong interviewed Allen in Vallejo.\n\\- 1978 letter controversy: In 1978, Toschi was removed from the Zodiac detail and transferred after it emerged he had written anonymous letters to a newspaper praising his own work; amid that episode, a “new” Zodiac letter received by the Chronicle was widely treated as a hoax, and Toschi denied suggestions he had authored it. He was reassigned from homicide but remained with SFPD until retirement.\n\nKey places and institutions\n\\- San Francisco: Birthplace, home, and SFPD service; led the SFPD investigation into Zodiac after the Presidio Heights murder.\n\\- Vallejo: Frequent interagency collaboration with Vallejo PD; the Vallejo Times-Herald (one of the original newspapers mailed by Zodiac) later covered Toschi’s death and legacy.\n\nOther figures linked to Toschi’s work\n\\- Bill Armstrong (SFPD partner), Jack Mulanax (Vallejo PD), suspect Arthur Leigh Allen, San Francisco Chronicle reporter Paul Avery, and author Robert Graysmith, whose work and the 2007 film helped shape public memory of the case.\n\nCultural links\n\\- Personal style and reputation helped inspire fictional detectives Frank Bullitt (Bullitt, 1968) and “Dirty” Harry Callahan (Dirty Harry, 1971). Mark Ruffalo portrayed Toschi in David Fincher’s Zodiac (2007); Toschi consulted on and attended the film’s premiere.\n\nDeath\n\\- Died at home in San Francisco on January 6, 2018, at 86; cause was pneumonia, according to his daughter, Linda Toschi‑Chambers.\n\nGroups/places worked\n\\- San Francisco Police Department (Homicide detail; later reassigned following 1978 controversy; retired in 1987).\n\",recXWIp8s3P3TAYiu,2018-01-06,\"<https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-dave-toschi-20180111-story.html>\n\n\",\"recnGQtKOfaGauwF5,recM454vnmOnqX3rD\",,,,,,,,\nrec5ZMZlwchZ0IHSr,Vallejo Police,\"Law Enforcement,Organization,Key Figure\",image.png (data/media/attUV8qcwU0CRAn5L_image.png),rec8HlpeGk8KlrXoi,\"recB8zHeGvqrResSA,recHCobnJv7S3C8N7,rec9XBV0F0FHhH4CD\",\"rec3uFgjJT93kVKzX,recONwZtq8jscehjB,recPBwwP4sg733WeY,recFRWQn7SW8hUN5d,recY8uibcMAlgpNjH,reckxMexr8sa80qXX\",1969-07-05,6,\"recMEZwnCFgLvvOBF,recURm55M69p21vYN,recrTjmSEryRyzq1k,recURm55M69p21vYN,recURm55M69p21vYN,recbF7clima1I0zrq,recURm55M69p21vYN,recURm55M69p21vYN\",\"recURm55M69p21vYN,recMEZwnCFgLvvOBF,recaz1wgcaqz0EFiQ,recioUzi4gjitPDzS,recT4sMRyAv9Sk1zs,recO5mW1mFKtK0hCE\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Vallejo%20Police&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Image Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Vallejo%20Police&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",\"recuxKDszc16AYdSr,recc5m61wdNJIJZy5,recTgGoZYdULVFNJf\",,,,29,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2025-10-26T17:49:30.000Z,2025-09-03T06:13:18.000Z,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"recaz1wgcaqz0EFiQ,recURm55M69p21vYN,recioUzi4gjitPDzS,recT4sMRyAv9Sk1zs,recO5mW1mFKtK0hCE,recioUzi4gjitPDzS\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Sq.

Born in Berkeley, California, he moved to Sacramento in 1917 at the age of three, where he would spend most of his professional career.\\n\\nProfessional Career\\nMorrill worked for many years with the California State Criminal Identification and Investigation Bureau, where he was estimated to have testified in court over 2,500 times. In the early 1970s, he transitioned to working independently as an \\\"\"examiner of questioned documents.\\\"\"\\n\\nZodiac Killer Investigation\\nIn the Zodiac Killer case, Morrill was a crucial figure in analyzing the handwriting of the letters sent to police and newspapers. He was instrumental in identifying that the various communications were written by a single author. His expertise was particularly valuable in attempting to authenticate and analyze the cryptic communications from the unidentified serial killer.\\n\\nNotable Cases\\nBeyond the Zodiac Killer investigation, Morrill worked on several other high-profile cases, including:\\n- Identifying Howard Hughes' signature in the Clifford Irving literary hoax\\n- Matching Juan Corona to a \\\"\"death list\\\"\" of murdered farm laborers\\n- Analyzing the Angela Davis case\\n\\nProfessional Philosophy\\nMorrill was known for his meticulous approach to document examination. He once remarked, \\\"\"Sometimes you feel like you're playing God when you shouldn't be. And you're not allowed even one mistake in this field. If you err, you are cross-examined fiercely.\\\"\"\\n\\nPersonal Life\\nMorrill was married to Rose and had several children: Kevin and Curtis Lee Morrill (both of Sacramento), Terry Sherwood Morrill (of Emporia, Kansas), and Sandra Jean Smith (of Chico). He also had stepchildren Judy Crews, Susan Henricks, and Gregory Brower, all from Sacramento.\\n\\nDeath\\nSherwood Morrill passed away at the age of 73 in his Sacramento-area home. His family requested memorial contributions be made to the American Cancer Society and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.\\n\\nSources:\"\"}\",\"recvqiA6dpfU6HX68,recQQnEmwWwpVACOp,recioUzi4gjitPDzS,recO5mW1mFKtK0hCE,recioUzi4gjitPDzS,recT4sMRyAv9Sk1zs,recioUzi4gjitPDzS\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Sq.

He was **73**.\n\nAfter years of work with the state’s Criminal Identification and Investigation Bureau—where it is estimated he testified in court more than 2,500 times—he went to work for himself as an “examiner of questioned documents.”\n\nAmong his most famous cases was the **Zodiac** inquiry, in which Mr. Morrill identified handwriting on taunting letters sent to police and newspapers as the work of a single author, whether publicly or privately written.\n\nIn other noted cases, he identified Howard Hughes’ signature in the Clifford Irving literary hoax affair, and matched convicted killer Juan Corona to the “death list” of murdered farm laborers.\n\nIn more than 50 years of analysis, he studied forged checks and questionable deeds, wills, and suicide notes; analyzed handwriting; and attempted the restoration of charred documents.\n\n> “Sometimes you feel like you’re playing God when you shouldn’t be,” he told _The Bee_ in 1974. “And you’re not allowed even one mistake in this field. If you err, you are cross-examined fiercely.”\n\nMr. Morrill was born in Berkeley but moved with his family to Sacramento in 1917 when he was 3 years old.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Rose; children Kevin and Curtis Lee Morrill, both of Sacramento; Terry Sherwood Morrill of Emporia, Kan.; and Sandra Jean Smith of Chico; stepchildren Judy Crews, Susan Henricks, and Gregory Brower of Sacramento; and eight grandchildren.\n\nThe family requests that any remembrances be made to the American Cancer Society, P.O.

Son of Ralph A. Spinelli, Sr. (deceased) and Muriel (Cassenelli) Pfleiger, brother of Lynda, Cherie, Jessica, and Neil. Ralph grew up in Vallejo, spending his life throughout California, Oregon, and Nevada. Ralph is survived by his two sons, Tony and Chris, and his grandchildren, Sofia and Enzo.\nRalph was known for his engaging personality, his joyous sense of humor, and his pride of his family. He had a passion for life, for Italian culture, sports, and cars. He was fortunate in his life to enjoy many incredible experiences, but none brought him more joy than the time he spent with his family.\nRalph spent his early career working in the restaurant business, owning and operating establishments throughout Northern California, Nevada, and Oregon. Later in life, he went on to found his own restaurant consulting company, working to support operators large and small.\nRalph's life was interrupted, but not defined, by two separate incarcerations. During his third act, he dedicated his life to education, earning his BA from University of San Francisco, his MFA from St. Mary's, and was earning his Doctorate from University of California. Drawing on his life experiences, Ralph became heavily involved in writing and prison reform, and became a published author on the topic. His dedication to his craft afforded him opportunities to engage and influence many policy makers, educators, and students alike, and will shape lives for years to come.\nFor those who knew him, he will be remembered for his pride, his passion, and his personality. An outgoing man with lots to give, he will be dearly missed by his immediate and extended family.

He grew up in Alameda CA. As a youth he enjoyed playing in the bay, raising pigeons, hopping trains, and selling peanuts at Stanford ball games. At fifteen, he lied about his age and joined the Merchant Marines. He sailed the South Pacific on the Matthew P. Deady, a liberty ship. He contracted Tuberculosis, was in an asylum in Livermore, then went to Yosemite to recuperate. He enlisted in the Army, trained at Fort Bliss, Texas, served on Guam, at Hanford Plutonium works, WA and San Francisco Presidio doing radar repair. \nAfter honorable discharge, he worked at North American Aviation developing oscilloscopes. He farmed in the Armargosa desert, then returned to SF to work for Fireman's Fund Insurance. Chet's first wife Yolanda passed away in a car accident. His second marriage was short but his third to Blandina Sarkis added love, happiness, family and great food to his life. \nHe had many good years in Tam Valley, CA, before beginning a farming venture near Turlock, CA. Chet and Blandina bought nut orchards and developed a successful walnut hulling and drying business. \nAfter Blandina passed away, the farming project lost appeal. Chet sold the farm and moved to Eureka, CA, where he made new friends. He spent his last decade working on winning the sweepstakes and enjoying his breakfast club friends Wesley, Joe, Chris, Pansy, and Joyce.

She lives on Lake Herman Road across from her parents house, two and seven-tenth's miles from the scene of the crime.\nMRS MEDEIROS relates that she came in from Oakland at approximately 10:50PM. Her mother called on the telephone and requested that she pick up her son, age 13, at the show. She states that she did not take her coat off, and glanced at the clock in the kitchen and she believes it was 11:10PM. She rode with her mother-in-law and her daughter and drove casually over the 2-7/10th miles, this time the distance being established by the officers, and she arrived at the area four or five minutes later. She estimates between 11:14 and 11:15 PM. Her clock is one minute fast as we had found out during this interview. She states that no cars were going in either direction while she\n### **Page 20**\n**STATEMENT: STELLA MEDEIROS 12/24/68 11:25 AM**\nwas on the road. When she arrived at the scene, headlights picked up the car and she observed a boy and he looked like he had fallen out of the open door. The girl was lying on her side facing the road. She had a purple dress on and looked well dressed. She saw only one car at the scene. It looked like a Rambler, grayish in color, it had a chrome rack on the top. This fits the description of the FARADAY Rambler. She states that she drove sixty or seventy miles an hour enroute to Benicia to report the incident. When she saw the police car she honked her horn and blinked her lights to attract the attention of the police officers.\n(Det/Sgt.

Decades later, his son Gary L. Stewart advanced the theory that Best matched the Zodiac composite sketch and elements of the letters, first in the 2014 book The Most Dangerous Animal of All and then in the 2020 FX/Hulu docuseries; these works brought Best’s name into the modern suspect lists and public discourse.\\n- Assessment of the claims: Major Bay Area reporting contemporaneous with the docuseries characterized the evidence as scant, largely circumstantial, and often rebutted (including contested handwriting comparisons and lack of verifiable links to crime scenes). Reporters concluded there was “almost no evidence” that Best was the Zodiac, and the series itself ultimately undercut the theory; law enforcement has not confirmed Best as a suspect in the case, which remains officially unsolved.\\n- Related figures: The “Ice Cream Romance” was covered in 1962 by Chronicle police reporter Paul Avery, who later became well known for his Zodiac reporting. In a notable coincidence frequently cited in coverage, Judith Chandler later married Rotea Gilford, an SFPD homicide detective who worked high‑profile cases; this connection has been reported as background but is not evidence of Best’s involvement in the Zodiac crimes.\\n\\nLater life and death\\n- Best died in Mexico City in 1984; press accounts summarize that he had a record that included convictions related to the 1962 case and other charges from later years. Public reporting places no verified nexus between his death in Mexico and the Zodiac case.\\n- Family accounts and secondary records state he was buried in an unmarked grave in Mexico City; some compiled records list administrative receipt dates different from the reported date of death, which is common with international filings.\\n\\nCultural links\\n- Best’s life intersected with notable Bay Area subcultures (Satanic Temple circles, underground music), and his later notoriety stems from true‑crime media: the bestselling book The Most Dangerous Animal of All (2014) and the FX/Hulu docuseries (2020), both centered on Stewart’s investigation and the Zodiac’s enduring cultural footprint.\"\"}\",2025-10-20T16:19:56.000Z,2025-10-18T16:38:23.000Z,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"generated\"\", \"\"value\"\": \"\"Earl Van Best Jr. (born July 14, 1934; died 1984) was a San Francisco rare‑book dealer later promoted as a Zodiac Killer suspect by his son, Gary L.

Reporting Officer requested an interview with Miss [REDACTED] in regard to the above mentioned incident with Darlene Ferrin. She complied. At VPD Miss [REDACTED] related that she was seventeen years old and baby-\n\n\\* \\*\\*SIGNATURE OF REPORTING OFFICER:\\*\\* Lieutenant Husted\n\\* \\*\\*ID NUMBER:\\*\\* 253\n\n---\n\\### \\*\\*Page 4\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*AGENCY:\\*\\* Vallejo Police\n\\*\\*CASE NUMBER:\\*\\* 243 164\n\\*\\*PAGE NO:\\*\\* 4\n\n\\*\\*NARRATIVE\\*\\*\n\nsitting for Dean and Darlene Ferrin. Again, reiterated the months were from January through May of 1969. Stated she quit in May to overcome some guilt that she was feeling about covering up for Darlene's running around with other men while she was married to Dean. One of the men mentioned was the surviving victim in the Vallejo homicide Michael Mageau.\n\nKaren relates one incident that allegedly occurred while she was babysitting in approximately February or March 1969 at 560 Wallace. She stated she was babysitting approximately 10:00 p.m. one night, was looking out the front window of the Ferrin's apartment, and she noticed a man whom she took to be middleaged sitting in a white American-made sedan watching the apartment. She stated he was there for several hours but left before Dean returned from work shortly after midnight. She stated she could not really describe this individual and only knew he was middleaged because he either turned on the inside car light or lit a cigarette so that she got a partial look at the man. She did not note the license number and was only certain of the approximate age - middleaged, and the fact that the sedan was white.\n\nThe following day she related this incident to Darlene Ferrin who at the time recalled was in the bathroom putting on her makeup to go out. Darlene asked her what the car and the man looked like, and after relating a description to her, Dee said something to the effect, \"\"I guess he's checking up on me again. I heard he was back from out of state.\"\" Followed by, \"\"He doesn't want anyone to know what I (meaning Darlene) saw him do. I saw him murder someone.\"\"\n\nKaren stated that Dee sometime during this conversation mentioned the man's name, and that the first name was very short, three or four letters and that the second name was just slightly longer. The name was quite common. Karen stated that Dee appeared to be genuinely frightened of this individual.\n\n\\* \\*\\*SIGNATURE OF REPORTING OFFICER:\\*\\* Lieutenant Husted\n\\* \\*\\*ID NUMBER:\\*\\* 263\n\n---\n\\### \\*\\*Page 5\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*AGENCY:\\*\\* Vallejo Police\n\\*\\*CASE NUMBER:\\*\\* 243 164\n\\*\\*PAGE NO:\\*\\* 5\n\n\\*\\*NARRATIVE\\*\\*\n\nand mentioned sometime that he had been checking up on her at Terry's Restaurant where Darlene was employed.\n\nAt the conclusion of her statement, Reporting Officer discussed with Karen the possibility of her recalling exactly what the name might have been, and a better description of the individual if she were to undergo hypnosis. Stated that she never had any experience with this, but that she would be willing to submit to anything that may assist in the investigation. At this time Reporting Officer advised Karen that arrangements would be made for a session with a hypnotist to see if we could produce more information, and that Reporting Officer would be in contact.\n\nOn 6-15-77, Reporting Officer contacted Lieutenant Larry Haynes, Concord Police Department, phone 415-671-3030, in regards to the hypnotic session. Lieutenant Haynes has been trained in this by the Law Enforcement Hypnotic Institute in Los Angeles Police Department and has had much experience in this area. When asked as to the feasibility of such an examination with an 8-year time span, Lieutenant Haynes replied much success has been had regardless of the number of years that has passed. Advised Lieutenant Haynes that the interview primarily would focus on Karen's ability to recall a name told to her by the Zodiac victim Darlene Ferrin and possibly focus on a painting party that occurred at Darlene Ferrin's residence where possibly the alleged subject was in attendance. Lieutenant Haynes agreed to assist. An appointment was made for 6-16-77 at 1300 hours. Reporting Officer then re-contacted Karen [REDACTED], advised her of the appointment set for 1300 hours. She agreed to meet Reporting Officer at the Vallejo Police Department.\n\",recURm55M69p21vYN,,,,,,,,,,,\nrecBpIteJUoIzFok3,Helen Axe,Witness,,,,recBEk4S1Y1NEAXt5,1968-12-20,1,rec9eYWhCQCUgaGyg,,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Helen%20Axe&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Image Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Helen%20Axe&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,,,6.333333333333333,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2025-10-08T01:37:51.000Z,2025-10-08T01:37:51.000Z,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Sq.

He also worked for the KTIM radio station, where the call letters supposedly look like the same cryptic symbols that the Zodiac used in his letters.\nMarshall's prints did not match the fingerprints that were collected from the Zodiac leters or crime scenes.

He was 94.\nHis family announced the death.\nAs a recently discharged Navy veteran, the Norwegian-born Kjell Qvale (pronounced shell KAH-vah-leh) entered the car business in 1946, using $8,500 in savings to invest in a Jeep dealership in Alameda, Calif. He had no particular passion for cars at the time; to him, this was strictly a business proposition.\nIt was also strictly business when he made a trip to New Orleans to meet with an importer to discuss expanding his line by adding James motorcycles, a not-terribly-fast British make known for its Jeep-like practicality. There, Mr. Qvale found himself standing on a street corner when “this goofy-looking car pulls up to the curb in front of me,” he said in an interview in 2008. He asked the driver where it was made.\n“England,” the driver said.\nThe car was the MG, and the driver turned out to be the importer of motorcycles he had come to see. He gave Mr. Qvale a ride.\nIt also turned out that the importer was looking for someone to market MGs in Northern California. Mr. Qvale returned to Alameda, which is just south of Oakland, Calif., sold the Jeep franchise and became an MG distributor.\nThe MG, the first imported sports car to appear in significant numbers on American highways, has been called “the sports car America loved first.” Its precision handling, accurate steering and zip made going to the grocery store a pleasure.\n“It’s fun to drive,” Mr. Qvale told The Wall Street Journal in 1960.\nIn 2005, the trade publication Automotive News said the MG’s postwar popularity in the United States “was largely because of one man, Kjell Qvale.” It characterized him as “the most imaginative and probably the hardest-working” importer.\nMr. Qvale added more British cars — Aston Martin, Austin, Austin-Healey, Jaguar, Morris, Bentley and Rolls-Royce — and became the exclusive distributor of these brands in Northern California and other parts of the West. (His dealership sold more Austin-Healey 3000s than any other American.) He later added the German cars Volkswagen and Porsche and, later still, Japanese makes.\nAt his peak, around 1970, he operated 100 dealerships. He estimated that as a wholesale distributor and retail dealer, he sold a million cars representing 36 makes.\nMr. Qvale’s impact in popularizing sportier, more luxurious European cars in the West is often compared to that of Max Hoffman, the celebrated New York car importer who commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright to design his Manhattan showroom.\nMr. Qvale, like Mr. Hoffman, overcame stiff obstacles. He persuaded reluctant banks to finance his unfamiliar breeds of car and insurance companies to insure them. He also had the logistically demanding task of providing parts and service for the foreign brands.\nHe promoted sports cars by sponsoring rallies, time trials and other competitions. In 1949, he organized the first postwar sports car race in the West at Buchanan Field in Concord, Calif. The next year, he was chairman of the first sports car race in the forest at Pebble Beach, Calif. To accompany the race, he proposed a show of classic cars; it became the [Pebble Beach Concours d’Élégance](http://www.pebblebeachconcours.net/), one of the top events in the world for car collectors.\nIn 1956, when the Pebble Beach race moved to nearby Fort Ord, an Army base, Mr. Qvale contributed to the design of its famously treacherous corkscrew at turns 8 and 8A of what is now [Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca](http://www.mazdaraceway.com/corkscrew-passport). He also organized a sports car race on the public roads of Golden Gate Park in San Francisco and teamed up with the racecar designer Joe Huffaker to race MGs at Indianapolis in the mid-1960s.\nKjell Qvale was born on July 17, 1919, in Trondheim, Norway, about 225 miles north of Oslo. His father, Bjarne, was a sea captain who commanded a freighter that operated between Chile and Seattle. The elder Mr. Qvale decided to leave the merchant marine and settle in the Pacific Northwest because it reminded him of Norway. Kjell was 10 when his mother took him and his four siblings to join their father.\nAs a boy, Kjell sold vegetable graters and phonograph needles door to door and had a newspaper delivery route. He was a track star in high school and won an athletic scholarship to the University of Washington, where he was captain of the track team. He once ran the 100-yard dash in 9.6 seconds in a collegiate meet.\nHe joined the Navy after Pearl Harbor and flew transport planes in the Pacific during World War II. A wartime friend who was the San Francisco-area distributor for Willys-Overland Motors, which made Jeeps, helped him get the Alameda franchise.\nIn 1970, Mr. Qvale teamed up with the car designer Donald Healey to buy Jensen Motors, and together they developed the Jensen-Healey, a powerful sports car with a Lotus 907 engine. They sold the car from 1972 to 1976. As majority shareholder in Jensen Motors, Mr. Qvale also sought to acquire Rolls-Royce but was unsuccessful.\nIn 1998, Mr. Qvale and his sons, Jeff and Bruce, bought the rights to make the DeTomaso Mangusta, a high-performance sports car. They made and sold several hundred before selling the rights and manufacturing plant to the MG Rover group in 2001.\nMr. Qvale’s other business interests included Brittania Jeans and the First National Bank of Marin. He bred and raced thoroughbreds and for a time owned the renowned come-from-behind racehorse Silky Sullivan. He also financed women’s professional tennis.\nMr. Qvale’s wife of 57 years (and his business associate for even longer), the former Kay Curry, died in 2005. He is survived by his sons, seven grandchildren and one great-grandchild.\nAlways eager to try something new, Mr. Qvale started taking piano lessons at 90.\n\",,,\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/business/kjell-qvale-an-instigator-of-americas-love-of-sports-cars-dies-at-94.html\n\",,,,,,,,,\nrec14NcXdKgWW5E5b,Xenophon Lusby Anthony,\"Suspect,Deceased\",image.png (data/media/attRZqgs7WrtfzQuX_image.png),,reczoUIdJkheOf6q6,,,0,,\"recXWIp8s3P3TAYiu,recioUzi4gjitPDzS,recT4sMRyAv9Sk1zs,recO5mW1mFKtK0hCE,recCminvBIPjwn90l,reckHGEdCfWzbM8L6\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Xenophon%20Lusby%20Anthony&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Image Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Xenophon%20Lusby%20Anthony&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,Suspect who lived near Paul Stine.,,6,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"generated\"\", \"\"value\"\": \"\"Based on the publicly available information gathered, here is a comprehensive biography of Xenophon Lusby Anthony in the context of the Zodiac Killer case:\\n\\n---\\n\\n**XENOPHON LUSBY ANTHONY**\\n**Role in Case:** Suspect (Deceased)\\n**Born:** January 28, 1931, Spokane, Washington\\n**Died:** January 17, 2016, Spokane, Washington\\n\\n**EARLY LIFE AND EDUCATION**\\n\\nXenophon Lusby Anthony was born in Spokane, Washington, to Dr. Marc Anthony and Ruth Anthony.

Although it originated in 1963 in Southern California’s Agoura Hills (over 3,000 people attended), the [Northern California Renaissance Pleasure Faire](https://www.norcalrenfaire.com/) also had a memorable run. That one started at [Marin’s China Camp State Park](http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=466) in 1967 and by 1970 had moved to Novato’s hilly Black Point area, where the above photo was taken.\nOf course, the fair was headlined as taking place at Black Pointe Forest, for more authentic 16th-century English country flavor. Fair personnel, all 2,500 of them on average, attended 30 different classes and workshops in Elizabethan style and folklore and, once the fair began, wore period attire, including ruffs, jerkins and snoods. Booths in pastoral settings sold handicrafts of the bygone era, madrigal singers entertained and food stands offered fattened turkey legs and tankards of dark ale.\nThe Renaissance Pleasure Faire was born in the minds of Ron and Phyllis Patterson, an art director and art teacher, respectively; both were adamant that Renaissance history and customs be presented as accurately as possible. The couple lived for many years in Marin and divorced in 1980, and their brainchild was sold in 1994; today, imitator renaissance fairs are held throughout the world. Ron died at age 80 in 2011 while living in a Sausalito floating home; Phyllis, who lived in a log cabin in Novato, passed away in 2014 at 82.

Like most of their neighbors, the Gassers were farmers, and for many years his father was the head dairyman at Napa State Hospital. At their ranch in Coombsville, the family had their own prune orchard, raised turkeys and chickens, and operated a dairy with goats and cows. The Gasser dairy was known for neatness and modern methods of operation, and working in it throughout his childhood taught the young Peter plenty about hard work. In high school, he was annoyed when other boys teased him about his rustic clothes, and left after ninth grade, but he soon went on to earn a banking certificate in San Francisco. He began working for the Bank of Italy (which was to become the Bank of America) in 1925.\nPete’s new job brought him into contact with bankers, local business owners, and other men of influence and power. It also allowed him to dress the part of the promising young businessman, and he impressed the young widow Vernice Wilson, whom he began escorting around Napa. The two were married in 1934. Pete Gasser soon left banking, telling friends that the Bank of America “wouldn’t let him run it the way he wanted to,” and went into business selling used cars in Napa, perhaps with his father’s help. After a rocky beginning he opened his own Dodge agency, promoted with a splashy opening that featured live vaudeville, free movies and branded souvenirs. The agency also sponsored a winning basketball team, who were provided with fine uniforms and chauffeured to the games in shiny late model Dodge cars. Pete Gasser was a natural business promoter, and became known around Napa as the man to talk to for a good deal on an automobile. But Napa suffered big losses during the Depression, and Mr. Gasser felt that the town needed direction from the Chamber of Commerce, which had lost drive and membership, in order to recover and prosper.\nAs his own business gradually gathered momentum, Pete Gasser gave the Chamber of Commerce new vitality and purpose. Starting as a member-at-large in 1938, he soon moved up to president from 1941-45, and remained influential for a long time afterward. With the national economy beginning to recover, and the possibility of another war in Europe on the horizon, Mr. Gasser insisted that the group take an active part in improving the city – pressuring for annexation of surrounding areas to accommodate new workers, arranging construction of infrastructure, and asking members to build housing for the booming population. The Chamber’s powerful voice was effective in directing Napa development before and during World War II. Under their auspices, Gasser facilitated the widening of Highway 29 between Napa and Vallejo and helped envisage the Napa airport. He was influential in negotiating with the federal government to construct wartime housing, and lobbied for dredging the channel from Carquinez Straits to Napa. At the same time he expanded his own business dealings into heavy trucks and other vehicles. He invested in other local businesses, notably Basalt Rock Company, bought more real estate, and brokered deals for the city.\nThough he never ran for elected office, Gasser himself was a major force for change in Napa, with business and civic projects that became almost too numerous to track between 1940 and 1975. His opinions influenced the mayor, supervisors and newspaper, and his influence, or lack of it, could make a project succeed or fail. As president of the Chamber, he was War Fund chairman for the American Red Cross, and was cited for distinguished achievement in raising funds for the group to support troops overseas. He helped bring the Oakland Oaks baseball team to Napa for spring training.\nGasser served on the advisory boards of the Bank of America, Silverado Council of the Boy Scouts, Napa Farm Bureau, and Native Sons of the Golden West, and promoted their interests through the Chamber of Commerce. He presided over the establishment of Robert Louis Stevenson State Park. Following his predecessor Nathan Coombs, Mr. Gasser served on the Golden Gate Bridge Authority, and represented Napa interests to the mayor and supervisors of San Francisco for twenty years. He became director of the Redwood Empire Association, and acted as co-chairman of fundraising efforts to build Queen of the Valley Hospital. He was a generous benefactor of Justin-Siena School. In later years, he helped expedite construction of the Southern Crossing via the Butler bridge south of Napa, a major transit project. In 1965, he sold Gasser Motors to devote himself to real estate and Napa Valley development. The Napa Register’s story quoted him saying that the development of the Napa Valley was “in its infancy,” and that “tremendous growth would be coming to the area in the very near future, after such needs as sanitation, adequate water for industry and domestic use and recreational needs were solved.” With increasing financial resources at hand, Pete Gasser purchased land for many more projects, including the remainder of the 145 acre site of today’s South Napa Marketplace. He envisioned the area along Soscol Avenue between Napa State Hospital and downtown as a major shopping area for the city, and began looking for businesses to make his dream a reality.\nThroughout the years, Pete Gasser approached relaxation as he did business–with gusto, in the company of many colleagues and friends. He was known for his “big” personality, and success allowed him to enjoy himself in the rollicking style of his era. An enthusiastic hunter and fisherman who loved the outdoors, he had special fences constructed on his property to accommodate the native deer, and was a major supporter of Ducks Unlimited. He had his pond stocked with rainbow trout, hunted deer in Nevada, and took a state senator salmon fishing in Alaska; he even hunted a polar bear. He also greatly enjoyed golf and was a charter member and the first president of the Silverado Country Club. While keeping his finger on the pulse of Napa, he became the larger than life figure that he clearly wanted to be.\nThere were the ranch hands he bailed out of jail; the employee with bad credit whom he still backed. Success did not rob him of the pleasure of doing favors for his friends. Yet more than anything else he was an astute businessman who relished envisioning projects and bringing them to fruition. He enjoyed knowing the right people to get things done, and working with them to accomplish the job. In his later days Gasser told a friend that he “hoped to leave something to the world so that I’ll be remembered.” The Gassers had no children, and as Pete had made his money in Napa, he wanted his inheritance to benefit the Napa community. He directed that his legacy be planned in the same way he had lived: carefully, strategically, and with Napa interests at heart. The Gasser Foundation continues the work that Pete would have done himself by contributing to all levels of the Napa community, because–to the end–Pete Gasser believed in Napa, and insisted that this commitment also be put “in black and white.”\nThe Gasser Foundation, surely, is something wonderfully generous for all Napa citizens to remember him by. Napa native Vernice Gasser was a daughter of the prominent Stoddard family, who arrived in California by wagon train from Michigan in 1871. Her grandfather, William Stoddard, settled in Napa in 1880, and with his sons soon established a prosperous grain and feed business which became one of the largest in the region, milling barley and corn. Vernice’s father, William Stoddard, Jr., died when she was only eleven, leaving her French-born mother Isabelle Ilos Stoddard to carry on the milling business. Though placed in an unusual position for a woman of her time, Mrs. Stoddard proved to be an outstanding manager of business affairs. She became a mortgage lender, began to acquire real estate, and advised other businesses on matters of finance; she worked at Napa’s department store (Albert’s), taught knitting there and in her home, and did volunteer work at the hospital.\nIn many ways Vernice, who preferred to be called Pat, was to follow her mother in her civic and business interests. Women of her era were beginning to assume greater responsibilities outside the home, and participating, though often behind the scenes, in business decisions. She attended business school in Oakland, where she received a certificate in bookkeeping and typing, and took her first job at Mare Island Naval Yard in 1920. She married John Wilson of Suisun, but after his sudden death in 1930 she returned to Napa and worked as office manager at Albert’s department store. Four years later, she married the up-and-coming young businessman Pete Gasser, and in 1937, the two opened Gasser Motors Dodge Cars & Trucks’ new showroom with a staff of thirty-one. Mrs. Gasser was in charge of bookkeeping and managed the office.\nShe had done volunteer work during World War I, and when World War II came she again became involved with the Red Cross and other charities. One of them began as “Bundles for Britain”, a war relief organization supporting British servicemen early in World War II; it later supported U.S. servicemen. Pat and other volunteers opened a salvage shop that proved to be such a fundraising success that the group continued to operate after the war on behalf of the Napa community. Pat Gasser was a founding member of the group, now known as Community Projects, and it became her major focus. Over the years she served in the capacities of CP president, treasurer, thrift shop chairman and hospital auxiliary chair, and under her direction an invitation to join CP became a coveted honor. She also spearheaded the purchase of CP’s current location as an investment for the organization. The organization made her a life member in 1986. Outside of Community Projects, Pat Gasser helped raise funds and served as trustee for the Queen of the Valley Hospital Foundation, and was named Woman of the Year by the Napa Business and Professional Women’s Club in recognition of her work for the town.\nPat was an enthusiastic gardener, regularly winning ribbons for her flowers at the Napa Town & Country Fair. She retained a childhood love of horses, and in 1939 helped to organize the Napa Valley Horsemen’s Association. Known around town as a stylish dresser with a taste for beautiful things, she was also an adventurous world traveler, venturing abroad to Asia, South America, and several regions of Africa. Though at heart the dynamic Mrs. Gasser and her husband Pete were intensely private individuals, both felt a lifelong affection for Napa. Mrs. Gasser agreed that establishing the Gasser Foundation as a charitable entity would be the finest and most enduring legacy they could leave their community. When she died in 1989, seven years after her husband, Mrs. Gasser had made sure that these dreams would become a reality. As in life, her closest and most abiding connection was with her hometown.\n\",recEKYdzhHISXUYQt,,,,recvaKNpColXeadv6,recvaKNpColXeadv6,,,,,,\nrecwRee0DtTX3tRVn,Richard Lonergan,Law Enforcement,,recguCeqiWgWqR24q,recuwj8s2c686PIHY,\"rec5msPLuYq5kmtBS,recGt8lxiIScGdDsZ,recJ0x1q0mKJ3HoOg,rechbYm0ZVeGYPHir,recgakvVJSzRguR75,rec4dpflLMPfQPPof,recfFXCpUWTJPWG6K,rec0JuyGt6pYv6pJO,recHQgFcpJHyKIHTf\",1969-09-27,9,\"rec4uzkCoOurp4K2R,recGa0aCpwMM0jQkt,reccuA38cGngbIk8v,reccno8wWTHdS0Go6,reccno8wWTHdS0Go6,recxuIuPaJDKhXKo6,reccno8wWTHdS0Go6,recbHhU4d2UWXPrIl,rec98vjxVJgVVbh1X\",\"rec4uzkCoOurp4K2R,recUj2059oNqhpwf7,recioUzi4gjitPDzS,recT4sMRyAv9Sk1zs,recEKYdzhHISXUYQt,recO5mW1mFKtK0hCE\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Richard%20Lonergan&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Image Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Richard%20Lonergan&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",reczLS0i9zVkwmRCs,,Responding officer to Lake Berryessa.,,4,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2025-10-20T16:19:56.000Z,2025-09-27T07:01:10.000Z,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"recioUzi4gjitPDzS,recT4sMRyAv9Sk1zs,recEKYdzhHISXUYQt,recO5mW1mFKtK0hCE,recioUzi4gjitPDzS,rec4uzkCoOurp4K2R\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Sq.

He was 88 years old.\nBill was born on January 7, 1921, in Fort Worth, Texas. He was the 10th of 10 children of Edwin A. and Lucille E. (Shoemake) Beeman. In his early childhood, the family lived on a farm outside of Golden, Oklahoma. Bill moved to Vallejo the first time with his mother, brother Jack and sister Ruth in October of 1928, residing in Hudson Alley. While attending Lincoln Elementary School and Vallejo Junior High School, he helped to support his family by selling newspapers for five years, seven days a week.\nIn 1933, Bill moved with his mother and brother Jack to Old Town, in San Diego, where he again sold newspapers for most of his high school years. He graduated from Point Loma High School in 1939 and then attended San Diego State College.\nWhile attending college, he worked as a night watchman for the Bill Gibbs Flying School, being paid with flying lessons. Discovering an enormous love of flying, he quickly obtained his commercial and flight instructors’ licenses. Prior to World War II, he taught flying for the Civilian Pilot Training Program in the Imperial Valley. In June of 1941 he became a flight instructor at Falcon Field in Mesa, Arizona, teaching Royal Air Force cadets skills in primary, basic and advanced flying.\nIn June of 1942, Bill went to work as a co-pilot for Consairway in San Diego, delivering PBYs and B-24s for the war effort. In 1943, he then became a flight captain for Consairway. Flying under contract for the Army and Navy Transport Commands, Bill’s responsibilities took him through the entire South Pacific, including Australia, New Guinea, Fiji Islands, Biak, Funafuti, and Tarawa. Between flights across the South Pacific, he was a test pilot and delivered planes to the East Coast.\nIn August of 1945, Bill Beeman married Nancy Jane Chandler from Vacaville, and within a few months he was drafted. He served in Korea with the Army Air Office in Seoul, and was honorably discharged in 1947.\nContinuing his flying career, he then worked as an instructor with the Vacaville Dixon Flying Service until he moved to Pacific Overseas Airways in Los Angeles and then Peruvian International Airlines in Lima, Peru. When his flying career ended, Bill had completed over 6,000 hours of flying time.\nAfter he was seriously burned in a fuel explosion and experienced significant legal problems as a result, Bill decided to enter the legal profession. In 1949, he started night school at the McGeorge College of Law in Sacramento. During this time, he worked as a bridge tender and telegraph switch operator for the Southern Pacific Railroad. In the last 15 months of law school, he worked as a U.S. Deputy Clerk for the Federal Court. He graduated with distinction from law school as second in his class, and started his own practice in Vallejo in January of 1954.\nDuring his 50 plus years in the practice of law, Attorney Beeman pursued each of his cases with a fiercely competitive spirit, applying his keen intellect, his gift of storytelling, and his loyalty to the rule of law. In short, he hated to lose. In his trial work, no one ever accused Bill Beeman of a lack of effort. Throughout his law practice, he was genuinely interested in his clients, treating each with respect and sincere friendship.\nBill was devoted to Vallejo and Solano County. He led the efforts to establish the Solano County Legal Aid and Mental Health Programs. He was a lifetime member of the NAACP and served as president of the Solano County Bar Association. He enriched many childrens’ lives as a swimming instructor for the YMCA. Bill was also an energetic supporter of the Democratic Party, being involved in the local Democratic Club and in many local campaigns of state and national candidates.\nIn 1969, he married Eileen Posedel of Vallejo. He enjoyed golf, fishing, and waterskiing. Throughout his whole life, Bill was busy with his law practice, or community work, or political involvement, or writing, or family É all at the same time.\nBill Beeman is survived by his children, Paul L. Beeman (Donna Kenney), Rockne C. Beeman, Kimberly S. Vaughn (Bill), William L. Beeman II, and Frederick P. Beeman; his grandchildren, Lauren, William, Andrew, Ryan and Sarah; and great-grandchild, Kylie.\nServices will be held on Saturday, February 21, at 11 a.m. at First United Methodist Church, 502 Virginia Street, Vallejo.\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the American Lung Association.\n\",,2009-02-01,,,,,,,,,,\nrec2vccsOHBGNhHqq,Jack Steadman Beeman,Tied to Suspect,,,,\"recDSp7lU4Djc5Gfi,recHz5B2RiT4gcioJ\",1991-11-01,2,\"recURm55M69p21vYN,rec8edd0yvQSGZsH0\",\"recrH8mYy6Oyhsol6,recWDkxvqnXtKTfw3,recURm55M69p21vYN,rec6dNi2OgiD6guXU,recioUzi4gjitPDzS,recT4sMRyAv9Sk1zs,recO5mW1mFKtK0hCE,recaz1wgcaqz0EFiQ\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Jack%20Steadman%20Beeman&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Image Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Jack%20Steadman%20Beeman&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,Posthumously accused by attorney brother in 1991.,,3.6666666666666665,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2025-11-16T22:56:05.000Z,2025-10-27T00:11:02.000Z,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"recWDkxvqnXtKTfw3,rec6dNi2OgiD6guXU,recaz1wgcaqz0EFiQ,recO5mW1mFKtK0hCE,recO5mW1mFKtK0hCE,recioUzi4gjitPDzS,recioUzi4gjitPDzS,recT4sMRyAv9Sk1zs\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Sq.

She was the daughter of Arthur Ferdinand Hanson (1876-1963) and Louise Dorothea Medau Hanson (1875-1954).\\n\\nOn June 8, 1931, Bernice married Ethan Warren Allen (1903-1971) in Solano County, California. Ethan was a decorated U.S. Navy aviator and trainer who graduated from the Naval Academy in 1927 and served from the 1930s through World War II. He flew various aircraft including Curtis Seagulls, Martin T4M Torpedo bombers, and Grumman Hellcats, and served as a Commanding Officer at the Corpus Christi Naval Air Station in 1941. He completed his Navy career in 1947 at San Francisco's Treasure Island Naval Base, retiring as a Lieutenant Commander.\\n\\nBernice and Ethan had at least two sons: Arthur Leigh Allen (1933-1992) and Ronald Allen. The family resided at 32 Fresno Street in Vallejo, California.\\n\\nEthan Warren Allen died on March 17, 1971, in Oakland, Alameda County, California, at the age of 67. Bernice outlived her husband by nearly 18 years, passing away on January 10, 1989, in Sonoma County, California, at the age of 83. Both Bernice and Ethan are interred at Sunrise Memorial Cemetery in Vallejo, in the Palm Court Mausoleum.\\n\\n**Connection to the Zodiac Killer Case**\\n\\nBernice Allen's connection to the Zodiac Killer case stems from her son, Arthur Leigh Allen, who became the primary suspect investigated by law enforcement. Arthur Leigh Allen remains the only person publicly named by police as a suspect in the Zodiac Killer case. The Zodiac Killer was a serial killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area between December 1968 and October 1969, claiming responsibility for multiple murders and sending cryptic letters to the media.\\n\\nArthur Leigh Allen lived with his parents at the family home on 32 Fresno Street in Vallejo during the period when the Zodiac murders occurred. According to his brother Ronald Allen, their mother gave Arthur a Zodiac-brand watch as a Christmas gift in 1967, which became a notable detail in the investigation given the killer's self-chosen moniker.\\n\\nFollowing Bernice Allen's death in October 1989, Arthur continued to live alone at the Fresno Street residence. In February 1991, approximately two years after his mother's death, the Vallejo Police Department executed a search warrant at the residence.

She was the daughter of Arthur Ferdinand Hanson (1876-1963) and Louise Dorothea Medau Hanson (1875-1954).\nOn June 8, 1931, Bernice married Ethan Warren Allen (1903-1971) in Solano County, California. Ethan was a decorated U.S. Navy aviator and trainer who graduated from the Naval Academy in 1927 and served from the 1930s through World War II. He flew various aircraft including Curtis Seagulls, Martin T4M Torpedo bombers, and Grumman Hellcats, and served as a Commanding Officer at the Corpus Christi Naval Air Station in 1941. He completed his Navy career in 1947 at San Francisco's Treasure Island Naval Base, retiring as a Lieutenant Commander.\nBernice and Ethan had at least two sons: Arthur Leigh Allen (1933-1992) and Ronald Allen. The family resided at 32 Fresno Street in Vallejo, California.\nEthan Warren Allen died on March 17, 1971, in Oakland, Alameda County, California, at the age of 67. Bernice outlived her husband by nearly 18 years, passing away on January 10, 1989, in Sonoma County, California, at the age of 83. Both Bernice and Ethan are interred at Sunrise Memorial Cemetery in Vallejo, in the Palm Court Mausoleum.\n**Connection to the Zodiac Killer Case**\nBernice Allen's connection to the Zodiac Killer case stems from her son, Arthur Leigh Allen, who became the primary suspect investigated by law enforcement. Arthur Leigh Allen remains the only person publicly named by police as a suspect in the Zodiac Killer case. The Zodiac Killer was a serial killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area between December 1968 and October 1969, claiming responsibility for multiple murders and sending cryptic letters to the media.\nArthur Leigh Allen lived with his parents at the family home on 32 Fresno Street in Vallejo during the period when the Zodiac murders occurred. According to his brother Ronald Allen, their mother gave Arthur a Zodiac-brand watch as a Christmas gift in 1967, which became a notable detail in the investigation given the killer's self-chosen moniker.\nFollowing Bernice Allen's death in October 1989, Arthur continued to live alone at the Fresno Street residence. In February 1991, approximately two years after his mother's death, the Vallejo Police Department executed a search warrant at the residence. Arthur Leigh Allen died on August 26, 1992, before any formal charges were filed. Despite extensive investigation, DNA and fingerprint evidence ultimately did not conclusively link him to the crimes.\n\",\"rec0s88W6nNyYJxjf,recjgYEXN7C9peYFq\",1989-01-10,,,\"rech3D7sonIMHkOft,recmQ9moIGpjHOofr,reczV15noceEWDHkD,recntWl4qqP88Laha\",\"rech3D7sonIMHkOft,recmQ9moIGpjHOofr,reczV15noceEWDHkD,recntWl4qqP88Laha\",,,,,,\nrecTlChleUbt31ZYY,The Beatles,Pop Culture,,recl25iy81YFuLSK6,,recVjurhso0tAiEcG,1968-12-29,1,recURm55M69p21vYN,,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=The%20Beatles&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Image Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=The%20Beatles&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",,,,,3.3333333333333335,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2025-09-25T03:57:48.000Z,2025-09-25T03:45:06.000Z,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",,\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Sq.

It is the only four-year college in [Napa County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa_County,_California), and the twelfth oldest institution of higher education in California.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:4-5) As a [coeducational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeducation) residential college with an almost exclusively undergraduate student body, most of those who attend the college are four-year students living on campus.\nPUC is accredited by the [WASC Senior College and University Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WASC_Senior_College_and_University_Commission) and maintains various programmatic accreditation for specific programs. Enrollment at Pacific Union College is roughly 825.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:6-6) The college offers about 60 [undergraduate majors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergraduate_degree) and three [master's programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%27s_degree) organized in 25 academic departments, with its [health science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_science) degrees the largest number of those sought out by students.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:3-7)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:6-6) The campus occupies 200 acres (0.81 km2) of the college's 1,800 acres (7.3 km2) in property.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:3-7)\nHistory\n[Sidney Brownsberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Brownsberger), PUC's first president**Early years (1882–1908)**\nPacific Union College was founded as **Healdsburg Academy** in [Healdsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healdsburg,_California), [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California), in northern [Sonoma County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoma_County), in 1882.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:4-5)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-pucabout-8) The creation of schools in the state was urged by [Ellen G. White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_G._White) and other church leaders in an effort to accommodate the Adventist Church's growing membership on the [West Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States) and to train young Adventists for its work. The academy officially opened on April 11 of that year. It was the twelfth institution of higher education founded in California, and is the second founded by the Adventist Church, the first west of the [Mississippi River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River).\n[Sidney Brownsberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Brownsberger) served as its first President. Under his term, the academy focused on both conventional study of standard subjects as well as practical skills, such as [dressmaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dressmaker), [blacksmithing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacksmith), [carpentry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpentry), and [cooking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking), in line with White's desire for the college.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:4-5)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:8-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-10) The lengthy tenure of William C. Grainger saw the heyday of the Academy's early years, but with the turn of the century, poor financial management led to increasing debt that eventually forced the academy to close in July 1908.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:4-5)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-11)\n**Move to Angwin (1909–1921)**\nAn early image of Pacific Union College's new campus in Angwin\nDespite this failure, many church leaders – including White herself – continued to push for expanded Adventist schooling, and efforts were begun in the 1900s to find a new location to rebuild the college. Many sites were scouted out in the [Central Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Valley_(California)) and elsewhere within the state, but none came to the satisfaction of the searchers.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:4-5)\nEventually, in 1909, the [Pacific Union Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Division_of_Seventh-day_Adventists) announced that it had found an opening to purchase the 1,636 acres of the [Angwin Resort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angwin,_California) on [Howell Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howell_Mountain,_California) in neighboring [Napa County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa_County). The property had been found through the church's St. Helena Sanitarium, and White visited the site in September in 1909.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:9-13) Satisfied with the condition of its facilities and living quarters and the ease with which they could be adapted for teaching purposes, its abundant resources in [springs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(hydrology)) and [lumber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumber), and the healthful living its geography would provide, White approved the location.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:8-9)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:9-13) The property was bought in the same month for $60,000 (roughly $1.9 million in 2022), and opened its doors September 29.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:8-9)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-14) The name of the college was finalized as **Pacific Union College** in 1910 to reflect change in location, even as it had changed names a few times before.\nPUC's first president at Angwin was Charles W. Irwin, who served from the opening of the new location until 1921. Irwin's term was marked by [self-sufficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sustainability) as the college adapted to its new location, with both the faculty and student body working to expand the campus through the area's available [natural resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:4-5)\n**Early 20th century (1922–1943)**\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, PUC expanded its educational programs with the goal of receiving [educational accreditation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_accreditation). Driven by suggestions from the college's [board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors), PUC required that professors have [postgraduate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_education) degrees to teach, created lower and [upper divisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_division_college), introduced [major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_major) and [minor degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_minor), and necessitated the completion of [senior theses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis) for graduation. The college also extended funds to pay for faculty members' graduate studies.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:4-5) With these changes, PUC became the first Adventist college to become accredited when it was awarded accreditation by the [Northwest Association of Secondary and Higher Schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Association_of_Secondary_and_Higher_Schools) in 1933.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-jaetimeline-15)\nThis era also saw further expansion of the campus community through the construction of more facilities – including new men's [dormitories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dormitory) and its current [gymnasium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym) – as well as through the creation of the college's first [student association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students%27_union), the Associated Students of Pacific Union College (ASPUC), in January 1935. The college's student newspaper, the _Campus Chronicle_, published its first issue in 1925 after being adapted from the previous _Mountain Echo_, while the _Diogenes Lantern_, PUC's current [yearbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yearbook), was first published in 1938.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:4-5)\nWith the United States' entry into [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II), over 400 male students and [alumni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alumni) were eventually [drafted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription) into military service.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:4-5)\n**Other history (1943–2023)**\nIn 2006 the faculty, administration, and Board of Trustees underscored PUC's commitment to undergraduate education by making a formal decision to remain a college and not change its name to university, as other small private colleges had done.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-reaccred-16)\nIn 2006, PUC's Board of Trustees made plans to transform the area into an [ecovillage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecovillage) of several hundred settlements, in partnership with Triad Development, a [Seattle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle)-based construction firm.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-17) Although the college downscaled its original plans due to community opposition – primarily by **Save Rural Angwin**, a local [NIMBY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY) group – the board voted in October 2010 to sever its contract with Triad and cancel the project.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:1-19)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-chronicle-20)\nPacific Union College has had a total of [twenty-four presidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_Pacific_Union_College). The first eight of these served while the school was still in Healdsburg. In 1983, Malcolm Maxwell became the first alumnus to lead PUC, serving for a record 18 years. Ralph Trecartin, the current president, took office in July 2021 after serving as the associate provost and dean of the College of Professionals for [Andrews University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrews_University).[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-21)\nThis section **needs expansion**.

It spans roughly 1,600 acres (6.5 km2). In addition to providing the resources necessary for the expansion of the campus in its early years, the forest has also served as a site for biological research and preservation, enclosing as it does unique [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species) and [biodiversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity).[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:2-50)[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:12-62)\nIn 2018, PUC partnered with the [Napa County Land Trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa_County,_California#Agricultural_preservation) to preserve the forest as a [conservation easement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_easement); the easement is currently held by [CalFire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Department_of_Forestry_and_Fire_Protection).[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:2-50)[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:12-62) Covering 864 acres (3.50 km2), the easement protects about half of college's total property.

Werner\\n\\nPersonal Information:\\n- Full Name: Karl Francis Werner\\n- Date of Birth: May 12, 1952\\n- Place of Residence: Vacaville, California\\n- Criminal Classification: Serial Killer\\n\\nCriminal Profile:\\nKarl F. Werner was a serial killer active in Santa Clara County, Northern California, during a period from 1969 to 1971. He was convicted of murdering at least three teenage girls during this timeframe.\\n\\nVictims and Crimes:\\nWerner's known victims included multiple teenage girls. One notable victim was Kathy Bilek, who was brutally stabbed 17 times in the back and 32 times in her chest and stomach. A maintenance worker at the crime scene recognized Werner, describing him as \\\"\"a little odd\\\"\".\\n\\nZodiac Killer Connection:\\nInterestingly, there was some initial confusion surrounding Werner's crimes. San Francisco police Inspector Dave Toschi initially suspected the Zodiac Killer might have been responsible for some of Werner's murders. The Zodiac Killer was reportedly driven to claim the Bilek murder from Werner, having previously laid claim to Werner's other two victims.\\n\\nLegal Outcome:\\nWerner was ultimately convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. At the time of his conviction, he was confirmed to have killed at least three victims between 1969 and 1971.\\n\\nCurrent Status:\\nAs of the available information, Werner was incarcerated at the California Medical Facility.\\n\\nSources:\"\"}\",\"recaz1wgcaqz0EFiQ,recO5mW1mFKtK0hCE,recioUzi4gjitPDzS,recT4sMRyAv9Sk1zs,recioUzi4gjitPDzS\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Sq.

B. Marsh of the Mines math department is currently working on the ciphers sent by the killer, “Zodiac.” In these messages Zodiac tells of his past murders and reportedly gives his name.\n\nMarsh is currently president of the American Cryptogram Association and has been a member for almost twenty years. Since 1960 he has been the editor of the foreign cipher section of the association’s journal.\n\nWill Stevens, a staff writer for the _San Francisco Examiner_, called Dr. Marsh into the Zodiac case last August. Stevens had received Marsh’s name from Farago, author of the book _The Broken Seal_, the story of the cracking of the Japanese codes before World War II.\n\nIn briefing Marsh on the killings that had occurred near Vallejo, California, on December 20, 1968, and July 4, 1969, Stevens disclosed that “an individual purporting to be the killer had sent letters accompanied by ciphers to three of the area’s newspapers.” Marsh agreed to help in solving the ciphers, and was able to extract the message from the copies of the code sent to him.\n\nZodiac apparently enjoys reading news of himself, as he sends to the news media coded messages in which he says lie the clues to his identity and future murders.\n\nAnd Zodiac said, _“W A → DRF?”_\n\nAccording to Marsh, some parts of the Zodiac’s messages betray the man as an amateur, while other parts show that the man has some sophisticated knowledge of cryptography. One point of note is the fact that he changes the key, which shows some knowledge of ciphers. However, an educated cryptographer, in drafting a message, would probably use a numerical rather than a symbolic code (such as the one the Zodiac uses), thus giving the ciphers more flexibility in their encoding.\n\nMarsh said, “In my opinion, some errors in the encipherment, as well as in the use of the various symbols rather than simple letters or numbers, indicate that the Zodiac… is not an experienced cryptographer. Each symbol represents a unique letter of the alphabet, but nearly every letter… was assigned more than one symbolic equivalent. These multiple substitutes and the omission of word spaces make the ciphers more difficult than the simple substitution ciphers found in many newspapers and puzzle magazines, but it would not require an expert to devise either of these complications.”\n\nThe ciphers consisted of various geometric symbols and alphabet letters, some reversed and inverted, printed in 8” × 17” rectangular arrays. According to Marsh, “the three portions incorporated the same symbols, indicating the likelihood that the same method of encipherment was used in each case.”\n\nThe three portions, when deciphered, seemed to make up a single rather wild message, in which the killer did not reveal his name as he had previously promised (“In this cipher is my identity.”).\n\nMarsh also related fears by many people involved that the current Sharon Tate murder case will sting Zodiac’s ego, prompting him to commit more murders.\n\nAnxiously meeting the challenge of decoding the messages, Dr. Marsh is currently working on the latest of Zodiac’s cryptograms. He has issued a challenge to the killer, saying that he can decipher the message despite the Zodiac’s efforts to outwit him. Until that time, though, the killer’s identity and future plans may possibly remain as much of an “unsolved puzzle” as they are now.\n\",\"reczWfX32jtMQCIm8,recHMbr3yhPRXcOFq\",,,recSSU3Hx8U3H6Lhj,,,\"1969 address: 4164 Mt.

He was born in Joliet, IL and was a WW II veteran who enlisted in the Army Air Corps on Dec. 8, 1941. He served in North Africa and Italy until the end of the war.\nRussell was a man with an enthusiastic and positive view of life that was contagious to those around him. He was a dedicated police officer and retired from the Solano County Sheriff’s Office in 1976 after 16 years of duty. He enjoyed a long and happy retirement that included golfing, singing, playing the drums and piano, flying his son-in-law’s airplane and making friends wherever he went. Most recently he appeared as a technical consultant on the Director’s Cut of the Zodiac movie discussing his involvement in the case.\nHe is survived by his wife of 65 years, Hope Butterbach; daughters Sharon Downey, Karen Eckerson and Debra McClanahan; son-in-law, Dean Eckerson; grandchildren Tracy Porten, Russell Miller, Mark Downey and Andrew Dussell; and great-grandchildren Theodore and Contessa Porten, Ethan Dussell, and Riley Miller.\nA private memorial is planned for family and close friends. In lieu of flowers, contributions to Kaiser Hospice, 975 Sereno Drive, Vallejo are appreciated.\n\",recURm55M69p21vYN,,\"https://www.timesheraldonline.com/obituaries/russell-t-butterbach/,https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/timesheraldonline/name/russell-butterbach-obituary?id=23764095\n\",recI0gNFiQpY1lgkB,,,,,,,,\nrecxHTsdw4Tk0HbdF,Coroner of Solano County,Law Enforcement,,rec8HlpeGk8KlrXoi,reck5VUTkmvwyouDo,recmEBTDwX3gqFDqL,1969-07-05,1,rec28Qgx8wQm99u8m,\"recaz1wgcaqz0EFiQ,recioUzi4gjitPDzS,recT4sMRyAv9Sk1zs,recO5mW1mFKtK0hCE\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Google\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Coroner%20of%20Solano%20County&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=\"\"}\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Image Search\"\", \"\"url\"\": \"\"https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Coroner%20of%20Solano%20County&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2\"\"}\",reck5VUTkmvwyouDo,,,,1.3333333333333333,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",2025-10-20T16:19:56.000Z,2025-09-12T04:59:07.000Z,\"{\"\"isStale\"\": true, \"\"state\"\": \"\"empty\"\", \"\"value\"\": null}\",\"recioUzi4gjitPDzS,recT4sMRyAv9Sk1zs,recO5mW1mFKtK0hCE,recioUzi4gjitPDzS\",\"{\"\"label\"\": \"\"Sq.

Meanies,\"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Meanies_%28Yellow_Submarine%29>\n\nThe **Blue Meanies** are the main antagonists in the [surreal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism) 1968 [Beatles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles) animated film _[Yellow Submarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Submarine_(film))_. They are a fictional army of disagreeable beings that abhor all music, [allegorically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory) representing all the bad people in the world.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Meanies_%28Yellow_Submarine%29#cite_note-hidden-1) Their visual appearance was mostly designed by [Heinz Edelmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_Edelmann).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Meanies_%28Yellow_Submarine%29#cite_note-Al_Brodax-2) Producer [Al Brodax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Brodax) said that the Chief Blue Meanie resembled production coordinator Abe Goodman.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Meanies_%28Yellow_Submarine%29#cite_note-hidden-1)\nDescription\nIn the surreal universe of _Yellow Submarine_, The Blue Meanies attempt to silence and occupy Pepperland, an underwater utopia filled with color and music. The Meanies have blue skin and claw-like, six-fingered hands. They wear black masks around their eyes and hats that resemble [Mickey Mouse's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mouse) ears on their heads. They are [humanoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanoid) in appearance — albeit with blue faces and very long noses.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Meanies_%28Yellow_Submarine%29#cite_note-Al_Brodax-2)\n**History**\nThe Blue Meanies launch an attack on Pepperland, a paradise where music and peace reign, in an attempt to crush its spirit. This prompts one of Pepperland's [sailors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailors), the former [Commander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander), now the newly appointed [Lord Admiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Admiral), known as \"\"Old Fred\"\" (or \"\"Young Fred\"\", according to the even older Lord Mayor), to escape in the Yellow Submarine to find help. Old Fred journeys to [Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool), where he meets [the Beatles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles), whom he enlists for help, since, as musicians, they would be able to restore harmony (and, indeed, melody) to Pepperland. The Meanies, in his absence, cause the lovely and colourful Pepperland to turn into a very grey, dull, and oppressive place, wrought with thorns and thistles.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Meanies_%28Yellow_Submarine%29#cite_note-risky_business-3)\nLater in the film, a Meanie abducts the Beatles' companion, [Jeremy Hillary Boob, PhD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Hillary_Boob), the so-called \"\"[Nowhere Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowhere_Man_(song))\"\". When the Beatles arrive in Pepperland, the audience sees how the Meanies have laid waste to the former paradise and petrified the natives. The Beatles find Pepperland's confiscated musical instruments and their own doubles, [Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band), and bring music back to Pepperland. This restores colour to the hills and plants and life into the Pepperlanders (who had been petrified by various weapons in the Meanies' possession). With their spell now broken, the Meanies lose their hold on Pepperland: even their guns start shooting flowers instead of missiles. Those that do not flee are invited by The Beatles to stay and \"\"mingle\"\", and they make peace with their former enemies.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Meanies_%28Yellow_Submarine%29#cite_note-David_Edward_Dayton-4)\n\",1968-12-29,\"recGZwp9mtC6qB9Hd,recTlChleUbt31ZYY\",recz1dFg4PlxNTlyi,\"recGynjEPcYPDzu8f,recVjurhso0tAiEcG,recZObAEkKbE1SP3e\",\"My_Name_Is.._letter_Z13_.PNG
