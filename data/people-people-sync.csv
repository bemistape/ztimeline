Born on July 31, 1949, Hartnell was a 20-year-old college student at Pacific Union College in Angwin, California, at the time of the infamous incident.

Early Life and Education
Hartnell was a student at Pacific Union College, located in Angwin, California. On the day of the attack, he was spending time with Cecelia Ann Shepard, a student from the University of California, Riverside.

The Lake Berryessa Attack
On September 27, 1969, Hartnell and Shepard were enjoying a peaceful afternoon by the shores of Lake Berryessa, off Knoxville Road. At approximately 6:30 PM, their day was violently interrupted by the Zodiac Killer. The assailant, wearing a distinctive black hooded costume with a crossed-circle symbol, approached the couple and initially claimed to be an escaped convict from a Montana prison.

Hartnell provided a detailed description of the attacker:
- Height: 5'8"" to 6'0""
- Weight: 225-250 pounds
- Hair: Dark brown, visible through the hood's eye holes
- Clothing: Dark blue or black pleated slacks
- Distinctive features: Knife in a case on the right side of his belt, cut rope in his rear pocket

The killer bound both Hartnell and Shepard, then proceeded to stab them multiple times. Hartnell was stabbed six times in the back. To survive, he strategically stopped breathing to feign death, which ultimately saved his life as the killer ceased the attack and departed.

Survival and Aftermath
After the attack, Hartnell managed to crawl towards the road, where he was found by Park Ranger Dennis Land. He was taken to Queen of the Valley Hospital, where he survived his injuries. Unfortunately, Cecelia Shepard succumbed to her wounds two days later.

Hartnell's detailed account was crucial to the investigation. He provided law enforcement with a comprehensive description of the attacker and the events of that day. His testimony helped create one of the most detailed profiles of the Zodiac Killer.

Later Life
In the years following the attack, Hartnell continued to be an important figure in the Zodiac Killer case. He even consulted on David Fincher's movie ""Zodiac,"" which explored the infamous serial killer's crimes.

His murder marked a significant turning point in the Zodiac case, as it was the only confirmed Zodiac killing within San Francisco city limits and provided crucial evidence that would define the investigation for decades to come.
Early Life and Background
Paul Lee Stine was born on December 18, 1939, in Exeter, California. He was the son of Theodore Milford ""Teddy"" Stine (1904-1967) and Audra Thelma Busby Harrison (1912-1988), and stepson of Roy James Harrison (1895-1968). Paul had several siblings, including his brother Joe Charles Stine (1935-1981), sisters Geneva Ann Stine Marriott (1941-2006), Thelma Fletcher, and Carol Lou Irwin.
Education and Career
At the time of his death, Paul was pursuing a Ph.D. in English at San Francisco State College (now San Francisco State University). To support himself through his doctoral studies, he worked multiple jobs: he was a part-time insurance agent and drove a taxi for Yellow Cab Company during night shifts from 9 PM to 5 AM. Paul was described as a dedicated student who worked diligently toward his academic goals while maintaining employment to pay for his education.
Personal Life
Paul was married to Claudia S. Stine (née Wescott). Standing 5 feet 9 inches tall, he was known for wearing glasses and was described as a bespectacled young man.
The Murder: October 11, 1969
On the evening of October 11, 1969, Paul was working his regular night shift as a taxi driver when he was hailed by a passenger in front of theaters near the intersection of Mason and Geary Streets in downtown San Francisco. The passenger requested to be taken to Washington and Maple Streets in the affluent Presidio Heights neighborhood. However, for reasons that remain unclear, Paul's taxi ended up one block away at the intersection of Washington and Cherry Streets.
At approximately 9:55 PM, the passenger—later identified as the Zodiac Killer—shot Paul at point-blank range in the back of the head with a 9mm semi-automatic pistol. This weapon was different from those used in previous Zodiac attacks. Three teenage witnesses across the street observed the killer in the front passenger seat of the taxi, searching Paul's pockets and wiping down the interior of the cab before fleeing on foot north on Cherry Street.
The Investigation and Evidence
The witnesses provided a detailed description of the suspect: a white male, 25-30 years old, 5'8"" to 5'9"" tall with a stocky build, reddish-brown hair in a crew cut, heavy-rimmed glasses, and dark clothing. Due to a dispatcher error that initially described the suspect as an African American male, two responding patrol officers, Donald Fouke and Eric Zelms, passed a white male walking east on Jackson Street but did not stop him. When the description was corrected, they realized they may have encountered the killer.
Officer Armand Pelissetti discovered bloody fingerprint impressions on the taxi door, which became crucial evidence in the case. The killer had also stolen a portion of Paul's shirt, which would later serve as proof of the crime.
The Zodiac Connection
Two days after the murder, on October 13, 1969, the San Francisco Chronicle received a letter from the Zodiac Killer claiming responsibility for Paul's death. The letter began with the now-infamous phrase:
""This is the Zodiac speaking. I am the murderer of the taxi driver over by Washington & Maple St. last night. To prove this here is a blood stained piece of his shirt"". 
The letter also contained the killer's most chilling threat: 
""School children make nice targets I think I shall wipe out a school bus some morning just shoot out the frunt tire + pick off the kiddies as they come bouncing out"".
Paul Stine's murder  was the Zodiac's only confirmed killing within San Francisco proper, bringing the case to the attention of the San Francisco Police Department. The crime provided the clearest eyewitness descriptions of the killer and yielded physical evidence including fingerprints and the piece of shirt that the Zodiac used to authenticate his letters. The murder also marked the last confirmed Zodiac killing, making Paul Stine the final known victim of one of America's most notorious unidentified serial killers.
The intersection of Washington and Cherry Streets in Presidio Heights, where Paul died, remains largely unchanged from that October night in 1969, serving as a somber reminder of this pivotal moment in criminal history.",,"The Stine Letter,Paul Stine Police Report,Paul Stine Record of Death,10/15/69 Coverage of Stine Letter,Paul Stine Certificate of Death,""Suspicious """"Aroused"""" letter to Modesto Bee"",10/18/1969 SFPD Wanted Poster,Paul Stine's stepfather's obituary,Paul Stine's obituary,1950 Census: Paul Stine","The Murder of Paul Stine in Presidio Heights,The Stine Letter w/ Shirt Piece,The Belli Letter,""Stine Letter is published, Zodiac linked"",Paul Stine picks up Zodiac at Mason & Geary,Paul Stine begins his shift,Paul Stine receives final dispatch from Mason & Geary to Presidio Heights,Paul Stine is born,Paul Stine's funeral,Paul Stine cremation,""Paul Stine """"bumps"""" sleeping soldier"",First police sketch is released,Paul Stine graduates 8th grade,Paul Stine interns for Democratic campaign,Paul Stine wins Lions Club speech contest,Paul Stine's father Teddy is mugged for $2,Paul Stine marries Claudia Wescott,Autopsy of Paul Stine",12/12/1939,"Paul Stine's home,""Exeter, CA""","Site of Paul Stine's Murder,San Francisco,San Francisco,Mason & Geary (Union Square),San Francisco,San Francisco,""Exeter, CA"",First Unitarian Church (San Francisco),Daphne Funeral Service,""Fresno, CA"",SFPD Headquarters,""Jamestown, CA"",""Turlock, CA"",""Fresno County, CA"",""Hughson, CA"",""Sacramento, CA"",""Janesville, WI""","Site of Paul Stine's Murder,Paul Stine's home,San Francisco,The Presidio,California,SF Bay Area,United States of America,""Exeter, CA"",""Tulare County, CA""","- https://www.imdb.com/name/nm10819628/bio/

She was the daughter of Leo Suennen Jr. and Norma Jean (Hightower) Suennen, and had several siblings including Leo Suennen III, Linda Doris (Suennen) Del Buono, Pamela Jean Suennen, and Christina Louise Suennen. 
Darlene attended Hogan High School in Vallejo, graduating with the Class of 1966. She was known by the nickname ""Dee"" among friends and family.
In January 1966, Darlene married her first husband, Jim Phillips Crabtree. The couple left Vallejo together but later returned to the area. Their marriage was short-lived, and they divorced. On August 3, 1967, Darlene married Dean Ferrin, her second husband. In January 1968, the couple welcomed their daughter, Deena Lynn Ferrin. The family initially lived at 560 Wallace Street before moving to 1300 Virginia Street in Vallejo.
At the time of her death, Darlene was working as a waitress at Terry's Restaurant (also known as Terry's Waffle Shop) on Magazine Street in Vallejo. She was described as popular and outgoing in the Vallejo community.
On the night of July 4, 1969, Darlene went out with Michael Mageau, a 19-year-old acquaintance she had met at Terry's Restaurant. Shortly before midnight, they drove to Blue Rock Springs Park in Vallejo and parked in the lot. At approximately 12:04-12:05 AM on July 5, 1969, an unknown assailant approached their vehicle and opened fire with a 9mm semi-automatic pistol. The attacker initially walked away but returned upon hearing Mageau's moans and shot both victims again before fleeing.
Darlene Ferrin was pronounced dead on arrival at Kaiser Foundation Hospital. She was 22 years old. Michael Mageau survived his injuries. An autopsy was subsequently performed on Darlene's body.
At approximately 12:40 AM, a man called the Vallejo Police Department from a payphone at Springs and Tuolumne Streets and claimed responsibility for the shooting, also taking credit for the earlier December 1968 murders of Betty Lou Jensen and David Faraday at Lake Herman Road. The caller spoke with police dispatcher Nancy Slover. This attack became the second confirmed case attributed to the serial killer who would become known as the Zodiac Killer.
Darlene Ferrin left behind her husband Dean, her young daughter Deena (who was approximately 18 months old at the time), and her extended family. Her murder remains one of the five confirmed canonical victims of the Zodiac Killer, a case that has never been officially solved. Darlene's daughter Deena later became a dental assistant living in the Bay Area.
Over the years, speculation has emerged regarding whether Darlene may have known her killer, though this remains unconfirmed. The Blue Rock Springs Park shooting remains a pivotal event in the Zodiac Killer case, marking the killer's second known attack and the beginning of his communications with law enforcement and media.","Attack at Blue Rock Springs Park,The Painting Party","Blue Rock Springs Police Report,Darlene Ferrin autopsy report,Darlene Ferrin / Jim (Crabtree) Phillips Marriage Certificate","Blue Rock Springs Shooting,Darlene Ferrin pronounced dead on arrival,Autopsy of Darlene Ferrin,Darlene (Suennen) Ferrin graduates Hogan High School,Darlene Ferrin leaves home with Jim Phillips / Crabtree,Darlene Suennen marries Jim Phillips Crabtree,Darlene and Jim Phillips Crabtree return to Vallejo,Darlene and Jim Phillips Crabtree divorce official,The Painting Party,Darlene Ferrin's sister Chris Suennen is 2nd runner-up in Miss Firecracker",6/18/1965,"Home of Darlene Ferrin (September 1969),Home of Darlene Ferrin (January 1968),""Albany, NY"",""Rosemead, CA"",""Vallejo, CA""","Blue Rock Springs Park,""Vallejo, CA"",Kaiser Hospital,Twin Chapels Mortuary (Vallejo),""Hogan High School (Vallejo, CA)"",Darlene Ferrin's parents home (1969),""Reno, NV"",Darlene Ferrin's parents home (1969),Home of Darlene Ferrin (September 1969),""Vallejo, CA""","Blue Rock Springs Park,""Vallejo, CA"",""Albany, NY"",Home of Darlene Ferrin (January 1968),""Solano County, CA"",California,SF Bay Area,United States of America,""Albany County, NY"",New York State,Home of Darlene Ferrin (September 1969),""Hogan High School (Vallejo, CA)"",""Rosemead, CA"",""Los Angeles County, CA""",,"Terry's Restaurant,Hogan High School",,,https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Darlene%20%28Suennen%29%20Ferrin&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=,https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Darlene%20%28Suennen%29%20Ferrin&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2,,"Deena Lynn Ferrin Pontious,Leo Suennen III,Leo Suennen Jr.,Norma Jean (Hightower) Suennen,Jim Phillips Crabtree,Pamela Jean Suennen Huckaby,Dean Ferrin,Christina Louise Suennen,Linda Doris (Suennen) Del Buono","Deena Lynn Ferrin Pontious,Leo Suennen III,Leo Suennen Jr.,Norma Jean (Hightower) Suennen,Jim Phillips Crabtree,Linda Doris (Suennen) Del Buono,Pamela Jean Suennen Huckaby,Dean Ferrin,Christina Louise Suennen",,Only fatality in Blue Rock Springs Park case.,,49,2/14/2026 3:03pm,9/2/2025 5:15pm,,rec0mHA5xfMB7wYES

Jensen was active in the Prima Vera Council #132 Pythian Sunshine Girls and attended the Christian Science Church (www.shadowofthezodiac.com). 
On December 20, 1968 she went on her first date with Faraday, a Vallejo High School senior. The couple parked on a gravel turnout along Lake Herman Road near Benicia, a well‑known lovers’ lane. 
Between 11:05 and 11:10 p.m. an unidentified assailant fired at their vehicle and then shot Faraday at close range. As Jensen fled, the attacker chased her and shot her multiple times; she died at the scene (Zodiac Killer). The murders shocked the Bay Area and were later claimed by the Zodiac Killer in his letters.

The son of a local pest‑control businessman, Mageau grew up in Vallejo and was living an unremarkable teenage life in the summer of 1969 (thecinemaholic.com). On the evening of July 4 1969 he met 22‑year‑old waitress Darlene Ferrin, a friend with whom he had been spending time; they drove to Blue Rock Springs Park, a popular lovers’ lane near Vallejo. A car pulled into the parking lot, left briefly and returned. Thinking it might be a police officer, Mageau and Ferrin searched for identification. Instead, the driver approached with a flashlight and opened fire with a 9‑mm handgun, striking both occupants multiple times (thecinemaholic.com). The attacker briefly walked away but, hearing Mageau’s groans, returned to shoot both victims again before fleeing. Ferrin died en route to hospital, while the 19‑year‑old Mageau survived despite four bullet wounds and severe injuries (allthatsinteresting.com). Minutes later, an anonymous caller claiming to be the shooter telephoned Vallejo police to report the crime and to link it to the December 1968 Lake Herman Road murders.
Recovering from his wounds, Mageau provided investigators with a description of the assailant: a white man around 5 feet 8 inches tall with a stocky build, round face and brown hair (allthatsinteresting.com). In 1991 he tentatively identified photo line‑ups of Arthur Leigh Allen as resembling the shooter, though he admitted his memory was limited and police never substantiated the identification (thecinemaholic.com). Mageau avoided publicity for decades, struggling with the trauma of the attack; he made occasional appearances in documentaries and true‑crime programs and served as a consultant for David Fincher’s 2007 film Zodiac (thecinemaholic.com). His current whereabouts remain private, and he has not publicly endorsed any particular suspect theory. Mageau’s account remains one of the few first‑hand descriptions of the Zodiac killer and continues to inform both official investigations and independent research.",Attack at Blue Rock Springs Park,Blue Rock Springs Police Report,"Blue Rock Springs Shooting,Mageau interviewed in ICU,Michael Mageau is born,Mageau's father interviewed by VPD,Michael Mageau's parents file for divorce,Mageau is given police protection",10/29/1949,"Home of Michael Mageau (1969),""Vallejo, CA"",""Highland, CA"",""Temecula, CA"",""Danville, CA""","Blue Rock Springs Park,""Vallejo, CA"",Kaiser Hospital,""Los Angeles, CA"",Home of Michael Mageau (1969),""Vallejo, CA""","Blue Rock Springs Park,""Vallejo, CA"",Kaiser Hospital,""Solano County, CA"",California,SF Bay Area,United States of America,Home of Michael Mageau (1969),""Temecula, CA"",""Riverside County, CA"",""Danville, CA"",""Contra Costa County, CA""","The Cinemaholic – Shivangi Sinha, “Michael Mageau: What Happened to the Zodiac Survivor?” (Oct. 24, 2024); All That’s Interesting – Kaleena Fraga, “Inside the Tragic Stories of the Zodiac Killer’s Victims — And the Mystery of How Many People He Murdered” (Oct. 13, 2025).","Hogan High School,Doyen Pest Control Service",,"Address	26483 9th St

While driving north to visit family, her car pulled over near Modesto, California when a stranger warned her that a wheel was loose. After he tinkered with the wheel it came off as she resumed driving. The man then offered her and her ten‑month‑old daughter a ride. Instead of taking them to a garage he drove around rural roads for two hours, making threats that he would kill them and throw the baby out of the vehicle (www.aetv.com, en.wikipedia.org). Johns eventually leapt from the moving car with her child, hid in a field and later reached the Patterson police. She later recognized a composite sketch of the Zodiac and a July 1970 letter from the self‑styled serial killer claimed credit for abducting “a woman + her baby,” but law‑enforcement never conclusively linked the abduction to the Zodiac murders (www.aetv.com, en.wikipedia.org). Johns survived the ordeal and lived largely out of the public eye; she is still regarded as a significant witness because her description of the driver contributed to composite sketches of the suspect.",The Kathleen Johns Incident,"The Kathleen Johns Letter,Patterson Police Department on Kathleen Johns Incident,Stanislaus County Sheriff's Report on Kathleen Johns Incident","The Johns Letter,The Kathleen Johns incident,Kathleen Johns reports incident to Patterson Police Dept.,Kathleen Johns is born",5/30/1947,"""San Bernardino, CA""","""Modesto, CA"",Hwy 132,""Patterson, CA"",""Patterson, CA""","""Patterson, CA"",""Stanislaus County, CA"",California,United States of America",,,,"At the time of the incident:

It traces its roots to January 16, 1865, when teenage brothers Charles and M. H. de Young founded the paper as the Daily Dramatic Chronicle. It adopted its current name in 1869 and, as San Francisco grew, the Chronicle became one of the largest newspapers on the West Coast by the 1880s (en.wikipedia.org). Now owned by Hearst Communications, the broadsheet remains the dominant daily newspaper in San Francisco.
The Chronicle is inextricably linked to the Zodiac case because the killer used the newspaper as his main conduit to the public. On July 31 1969, a letter arrived at the Chronicle in which a person claimed responsibility for the Lake Herman Road and Blue Rock Springs murders and enclosed a portion of a cipher; the other two parts were mailed to the Vallejo Times‑Herald and the San Francisco Examiner. Over the next several years the killer sent a string of taunting letters, cards and cryptograms to newspapers — 17 of the 22 known communications were delivered to the Chronicle (www.sfchronicle.com). Among them were a letter containing part of taxi driver Paul Stine’s shirt, and a Halloween card that threatened Chronicle reporter Paul Avery. The Chronicle published many of these communications and played a central role in reporting on the case, but there is no evidence that anyone at the paper had any connection to the crimes; its involvement was as a journalistic intermediary between the killer and the public.",,"The Cipher Letter #2 (SF Chronicle),The Stine Letter,The Bus Bomb Letter,The Button Letter and Diablo Map,The Sierra Club Postcard,The Badlands Letter","The Halloween Card,The Sierra Club Postcard,The Dripping Pen Card & Z340 Cipher mailed,The Eureka Christmas Card,SF Chronicle coverage of case status,Count Marco's Chicago letter referencing Red Phantom,Red Phantom letter and Badlands letter are published in SF Chronicle,The Exorcist Letter is published in the SF Chronicle,""Stine Letter is published, Zodiac linked"",""Dripping Pen / Z340 / Bus Bomb Letter published, linked to San Jose murders"",Riverside connection is published in SF Chronicle,""""""A Challenge for the Zodiac"""" letter sent to Paul Avery"",""SF Chronicle: """"Cops No Closer on Zodiac Identity"""""",""SF Chronicle: """"Bay Killer's Shrinking Timetable"""""",Zodiac Press Coverage [10/15/1969],Dick Tracy: Zodiac plotline (10/12/1969),Dick Tracy: Zodiac plotline (10/11/1969),Dick Tracy: Zodiac plotline (10/11/1969) copy,SF Chronicle/Examiner: Vallejo Mass Murder Threat Fails,Zodiac Press Coverage [8/2/1969],Zodiac Press Coverage [7/6/1969]",10/2/1962,San Francisco,"San Francisco,San Francisco,San Francisco,""Eureka, CA"",San Francisco,San Francisco,Chicago,San Francisco Chronicle offices,San Francisco,San Francisco,San Francisco,San Francisco,San Francisco,San Francisco,""Fairfield, CA"",San Francisco,San Francisco Chronicle offices,San Francisco,""Los Angeles, CA"",San Francisco,San Francisco,San Francisco,""Vallejo, CA"",""Solano County, CA"",""Vallejo, CA"",San Francisco,""Vallejo, CA"",San Francisco","San Francisco,SF Bay Area,California,United States of America",,,"Robert Graysmith,Herb Caen,Keith Power",,https://www.google.com/search?as_q=San%20Francisco%20Chronicle&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=,https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=San%20Francisco%20Chronicle&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2,"1974 Red Phantom Letter,The Exorcist Letter,Paul Stine's obituary",,,,,,38,2/14/2026 3:29pm,9/2/2025 9:04pm,,rec5NLNj8q2bpKjm8

Born in Omaha, Nebraska, she grew up in Riverside, California, where she excelled at Ramona High School as a cheerleader, student government participant and honor student (en.wikipedia.org, heathermonroe.medium.com). After graduation she studied at Riverside City College and worked part-time at Riverside National Bank, using her earnings to buy a 1960 Volkswagen Beetle (en.wikipedia.org). Friends described her as friendly and outgoing, and she hoped to become a flight attendant (en.wikipedia.org).
On October 30 1966 Bates told her father she was going to the Riverside City College library to study. Investigators later concluded that someone disabled the ignition and distributor of her Volkswagen, luring her away from her car. Early on the morning of October 31 her body was found in an alley near the library; she had been stabbed multiple times and her throat had been slashed, but she had not been robbed or sexually assaulted (en.wikipedia.org, www.zodiackiller.com). Months later anonymous letters and a poem claimed responsibility for the murder, and in 1971 an individual signing himself “the Zodiac” also claimed it. Some researchers have speculated that the crime was the Zodiac killer’s first attack, but the Riverside Police Department has maintained that there is no evidence linking the murder to the Zodiac and believes the perpetrator was a local person (en.wikipedia.org).

Bay Area broadcaster and longtime KGO Radio/KGO‑TV host whose live morning program became the stage for the high‑profile October 22, 1969 “Sam” call from a man claiming to be the Zodiac; the caller was later identified as a mental patient, not the Zodiac.

Biography:
- Jim Dunbar was an American radio program director, talk show host, and news anchor best known for transforming KGO Radio into a Bay Area ratings leader and for hosting AM San Francisco on KGO‑TV starting in the mid‑1960s.
- Born in Dearborn, Michigan, he worked early in his career in Detroit (WXYZ), New Orleans (WDSU, also as station manager), and Chicago (WLS) before joining KGO in 1963, where he spent 37 years and became a central media figure in San Francisco.
- On October 22, 1969, amid intense public interest in the Zodiac case, Oakland Police received a predawn call from a man claiming to be Zodiac who demanded that attorney F. Lee Bailey or Melvin Belli appear on Dunbar’s KGO‑TV show; Belli appeared, and during the live broadcast a caller identifying himself as “Sam” phoned repeatedly to speak with them.
- Police and investigators later determined the caller was Eric Weill (often misspelled “Weil”), a mental patient calling from a state hospital, and ruled him out as the Zodiac; Dunbar’s broadcast nevertheless became one of the case’s most widely remembered media moments.
- Dunbar continued a prominent Bay Area career; in 1973 he survived an on‑air shooting attempt at KGO when a gunman fired at him through studio glass, an incident that became part of his public profile.
- Honors include induction into the National Radio Hall of Fame (1999) and the inaugural class of the Bay Area Radio Hall of Fame (2006).
- In popular culture, Dunbar was portrayed by Tom Verica in David Fincher’s 2007 film “Zodiac,” which recreates the KGO‑TV call sequence.

An American novelist and San Francisco Chronicle columnist best known for Tales of the City. In 1978, he alerted authorities after noticing similarities between anonymous “fan letters” he’d received and a new Zodiac letter, which led to an internal inquiry and Inspector Dave Toschi’s removal from the Zodiac case; Toschi admitted sending the fan letters but denied writing the Zodiac letter and was later cleared of that allegation

Armistead Jones Maupin Jr., born in Washington, D.C., and raised in Raleigh, North Carolina, is an American writer whose Tales of the City began as a 1974 newspaper serial before moving to the San Francisco Chronicle in 1976 and later becoming a celebrated nine‑novel series and multiple screen adaptations. 
While writing his Chronicle serial, Maupin consulted SFPD Inspector Dave Toschi in 1976 to shape a fictional homicide detective, and soon received anonymous fan letters praising Toschi that he later concluded were fabricated by Toschi himself. 
After a new missive purporting to be from the Zodiac arrived at the Chronicle on April 24, 1978—containing lines such as “This is the Zodiac speaking I am back with you. Tell herb caen I am here” and mentioning “that city pig toschi”—Maupin reported his concerns to SFPD, prompting an investigation; Toschi admitted writing the fan letters to Maupin and was reassigned from homicide but publicly denied writing the 1978 Zodiac letter and was later exonerated of that accusation. Maupin’s role in surfacing the letter controversy linked him directly to one of the case’s most scrutinized episodes, documented at the time in local news footage and press reports. 
Beyond the Zodiac episode, Maupin’s cultural footprint includes television adaptations of Tales of the City and the depiction of the 1978 letter controversy in the 2007 film Zodiac. In later years, Maupin lived in New Mexico and, from 2019, in London’s Clapham; he became a British citizen in 2023.

Events:
- 1974–1976: Tales of the City serialized; moves to the San Francisco Chronicle in 1976.
- 1976: Consults Inspector Dave Toschi; begins receiving anonymous fan letters praising Toschi, later revealed to have been written by Toschi.
- April 24, 1978: New “Zodiac” letter arrives at the Chronicle, referencing Herb Caen and “city pig toschi”; widely regarded by experts as a forgery.
- July 11, 1978: Public press briefing; Toschi is removed from the Zodiac case and reassigned following admission that he wrote the fan letters, while denying authorship of the 1978 Zodiac letter.
- Subsequent years: Toschi later cleared of forging the 1978 Zodiac letter; the incident remains a notable chapter in the case’s history.

Relatives:
- Spouse: Christopher Turner (m. 2007).
- Cousin: Sarah Jane Morris (singer).

Groups a member of or places worked:
- San Francisco Chronicle (columnist/serial author).
- Pacific Sun (initial Tales of the City serial).
- Associated Press, San Francisco bureau (early career).
- WRAL‑TV, Raleigh (early career).
- United States Navy (veteran).

Cultural links to the Zodiac case:
- The April 24, 1978 letter text (beginning “This is the Zodiac speaking I am back with you”) is preserved in the public domain and is generally deemed a forgery by experts; Maupin’s alert to SFPD about similarities with Toschi’s fan letters triggered the internal review.
- The 1978 controversy and Toschi’s reassignment were covered contemporaneously by major media; officials said Toschi denied writing any Zodiac letters and that his handwriting was examined only regarding the fan letters to Maupin.
- The episode is referenced in cultural retellings, including the 2007 film Zodiac.

He partnered with Inspector Bill Armstrong and pursued the case for years, becoming one of the best-known law enforcement figures associated with the Zodiac killings and a touchstone in American pop culture through film portrayals inspired by his persona and work.

Early life and SFPD career
- Born in San Francisco on July 11, 1931; he served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War before joining the SFPD in 1952. He moved to the homicide detail in 1966 and served there through the 1970s.
- Known for a dapper style (bow ties, quick-draw shoulder holster), he gained a reputation as a persistent, by‑the‑book investigator.

Role in the Zodiac case
- Assigned to the Zodiac investigation after the Oct. 11, 1969 murder of Paul Stine in San Francisco; he and partner Bill Armstrong became the SFPD leads on the case and coordinated with neighboring agencies including Vallejo PD.
- July–August 1971: Investigators met and then interviewed suspect Arthur Leigh Allen. On July 27, 1971, Vallejo Det. Jack Mulanax met with SFPD Inspectors Toschi and Armstrong in Vallejo to coordinate; on August 4, 1971, Mulanax, Toschi, and Armstrong interviewed Allen in Vallejo.
- 1978 letter controversy: In 1978, Toschi was removed from the Zodiac detail and transferred after it emerged he had written anonymous letters to a newspaper praising his own work; amid that episode, a “new” Zodiac letter received by the Chronicle was widely treated as a hoax, and Toschi denied suggestions he had authored it. He was reassigned from homicide but remained with SFPD until retirement.

Key places and institutions
- San Francisco: Birthplace, home, and SFPD service; led the SFPD investigation into Zodiac after the Presidio Heights murder.
- Vallejo: Frequent interagency collaboration with Vallejo PD; the Vallejo Times-Herald (one of the original newspapers mailed by Zodiac) later covered Toschi’s death and legacy.

Other figures linked to Toschi’s work
- Bill Armstrong (SFPD partner), Jack Mulanax (Vallejo PD), suspect Arthur Leigh Allen, San Francisco Chronicle reporter Paul Avery, and author Robert Graysmith, whose work and the 2007 film helped shape public memory of the case.

Cultural links
- Personal style and reputation helped inspire fictional detectives Frank Bullitt (Bullitt, 1968) and “Dirty” Harry Callahan (Dirty Harry, 1971). Mark Ruffalo portrayed Toschi in David Fincher’s Zodiac (2007); Toschi consulted on and attended the film’s premiere.

Death
- Died at home in San Francisco on January 6, 2018, at 86; cause was pneumonia, according to his daughter, Linda Toschi‑Chambers.

Private services have been held for Sherwood Morrill, an analyst of questioned documents who worked on such well-known cases as Angela Davis, Juan Corona, Clifford Irving, and the Zodiac killer.

Mr. Morrill, a longtime state employee before going into business for himself in the early 1970s, died Saturday in his Sacramento-area home. He was 73.

After years of work with the state’s Criminal Identification and Investigation Bureau—where it is estimated he testified in court more than 2,500 times—he went to work for himself as an “examiner of questioned documents.”

Among his most famous cases was the Zodiac inquiry, in which Mr. Morrill identified handwriting on taunting letters sent to police and newspapers as the work of a single author, whether publicly or privately written.

In other noted cases, he identified Howard Hughes’ signature in the Clifford Irving literary hoax affair, and matched convicted killer Juan Corona to the “death list” of murdered farm laborers.

In more than 50 years of analysis, he studied forged checks and questionable deeds, wills, and suicide notes; analyzed handwriting; and attempted the restoration of charred documents.

“Sometimes you feel like you’re playing God when you shouldn’t be,” he told The Bee in 1974. “And you’re not allowed even one mistake in this field. If you err, you are cross-examined fiercely.”

Mr. Morrill was born in Berkeley but moved with his family to Sacramento in 1917 when he was 3 years old.

He is survived by his wife, Rose; children Kevin and Curtis Lee Morrill, both of Sacramento; Terry Sherwood Morrill of Emporia, Kan.; and Sandra Jean Smith of Chico; stepchildren Judy Crews, Susan Henricks, and Gregory Brower of Sacramento; and eight grandchildren.

The family requests that any remembrances be made to the American Cancer Society, P.O. Box 16038, Sacramento, 95816, or Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, 6201 Florin-Perkins Road, Sacramento, 95828.",Zodiac Letters,,"Sherwood Morrill: ALA's handwriting doesn't match Zodiac,""Paul Avery discussed suspect """"Joost"""" with Sherwood Morrill""",11/17/1969,"""Berkeley, CA"",""Sacramento, CA""","""Sacramento, CA"",""Vallejo, CA"",San Francisco","""Sacramento, CA"",""Berkeley, CA"",""Sacramento County, CA"",California,United States of America,""Alameda County, CA"",SF Bay Area",,California Criminal Identification and Investigation (CII),,,https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Sherwood%20Mason%20Morrill&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=,https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Sherwood%20Mason%20Morrill&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2,Sherwood Morrill report on Arthur Leigh Allen,,,,Questioned Documents Examiner,,27,10/20/2025 11:21am,9/28/2025 3:56pm,,rec5opHF6J5pu58Uu

Son of Ralph A. Spinelli, Sr. (deceased) and Muriel (Cassenelli) Pfleiger, brother of Lynda, Cherie, Jessica, and Neil. Ralph grew up in Vallejo, spending his life throughout California, Oregon, and Nevada. Ralph is survived by his two sons, Tony and Chris, and his grandchildren, Sofia and Enzo.
Ralph was known for his engaging personality, his joyous sense of humor, and his pride of his family. He had a passion for life, for Italian culture, sports, and cars. He was fortunate in his life to enjoy many incredible experiences, but none brought him more joy than the time he spent with his family.
Ralph spent his early career working in the restaurant business, owning and operating establishments throughout Northern California, Nevada, and Oregon. Later in life, he went on to found his own restaurant consulting company, working to support operators large and small.
Ralph's life was interrupted, but not defined, by two separate incarcerations. During his third act, he dedicated his life to education, earning his BA from University of San Francisco, his MFA from St. Mary's, and was earning his Doctorate from University of California. Drawing on his life experiences, Ralph became heavily involved in writing and prison reform, and became a published author on the topic. His dedication to his craft afforded him opportunities to engage and influence many policy makers, educators, and students alike, and will shape lives for years to come.
For those who knew him, he will be remembered for his pride, his passion, and his personality. An outgoing man with lots to give, he will be dearly missed by his immediate and extended family.

CHESTER CLARK KLINGEL Jr. May 27,1926 ~ January 17, 2017 Chester Clark Klingel Jr. ""Chet"" was born in San Francisco CA to Alice Marjorie Stewart and Chester Clark Klingel. He grew up in Alameda CA. As a youth he enjoyed playing in the bay, raising pigeons, hopping trains, and selling peanuts at Stanford ball games. At fifteen, he lied about his age and joined the Merchant Marines. He sailed the South Pacific on the Matthew P. Deady, a liberty ship. He contracted Tuberculosis, was in an asylum in Livermore, then went to Yosemite to recuperate. He enlisted in the Army, trained at Fort Bliss, Texas, served on Guam, at Hanford Plutonium works, WA and San Francisco Presidio doing radar repair. 
After honorable discharge, he worked at North American Aviation developing oscilloscopes. He farmed in the Armargosa desert, then returned to SF to work for Fireman's Fund Insurance. Chet's first wife Yolanda passed away in a car accident. His second marriage was short but his third to Blandina Sarkis added love, happiness, family and great food to his life. 
He had many good years in Tam Valley, CA, before beginning a farming venture near Turlock, CA. Chet and Blandina bought nut orchards and developed a successful walnut hulling and drying business. 
After Blandina passed away, the farming project lost appeal. Chet sold the farm and moved to Eureka, CA, where he made new friends. He spent his last decade working on winning the sweepstakes and enjoying his breakfast club friends Wesley, Joe, Chris, Pansy, and Joyce. Chet loved the ocean, bays, pigeons, building projects, his friends, driving, Yosemite, barbequing, pinching Blandina's nose, and singing. 
Chester is survived by his son Schubert Simon Sarkis, his daughters Joanne Carr, Jeannette Smith, Sandra Klingel, and other family members including: Maribel Pairan and family, Eshmael and Lucy Sarkis and family, Nahrine, Orlando and Jessica Mazariegos, Emanuel Malik, Ramina Emanoud, Yda, Allen, Arielle and David Filiberti, Elizabeth, Andy and Danny Oppo, Fred Sacco, Rosanna Sacco-Colas, Robert, Dorothy, Brian, and Erin Moy. ","Cryptography,Military",,"The Eureka Christmas Card,Chester Klingel Jr. DNA tested,Chester Klingel Jr. promoted to message center chief in US Army,Chester Klingel Jr. marries third wife Blandina,Chester Klingel III dies,Chester Klingel Jr. starts satellite business,Chester Klingel III arrested for pot,Chester Klingel Jr.'s wife Blandina dies,Chester Klinger Jr.'s second wedding,Chester Klingel Jr.'s first wife dies,Chester Klingel Jr. in bad car accident",3/13/1950,"""Mill Valley, CA"",""Eureka, CA"",San Francisco,""Hughson, CA"",""Alameda, CA"",Guam,""Stockton, CA""","""Eureka, CA"",""Vallejo, CA"",Guam,""Reno, NV"",""Burley, ID"",""Rupert, ID"",""Hughson, CA"",""Novato, CA"",""Hughson, CA"",""Turlock, CA"",""Mill Valley, CA"",""Stockton, CA"",""Oakdale, CA"",""Sausalito, CA""","""Eureka, CA"",San Francisco,""Livermore, CA"",Amargosa Desert,The Presidio,California,SF Bay Area,United States of America,""Alameda County, CA"",""Humboldt County, CA"",""Alameda, CA"",""Nye County, NV"",""Mill Valley, CA"",Nevada,""Marin County, CA""",,"Merchant Marines,Fireman's Fund Insurance,United States Army",,"In 1950:

OFFENSE REPORT
OFFENSE: 187 P.C. Murder CASE NO: V-25564 RO: DET/SGT LUNDBLAD STATEMENT: STELLA MEDEIROS, WFA age 32, P.O. Box 477, Vallejo, CA (644-[redacted])
MRS MEDEIROS is the former STELLA BORGES. She lives on Lake Herman Road across from her parents house, two and seven-tenth's miles from the scene of the crime.
MRS MEDEIROS relates that she came in from Oakland at approximately 10:50PM. Her mother called on the telephone and requested that she pick up her son, age 13, at the show. She states that she did not take her coat off, and glanced at the clock in the kitchen and she believes it was 11:10PM. She rode with her mother-in-law and her daughter and drove casually over the 2-7/10th miles, this time the distance being established by the officers, and she arrived at the area four or five minutes later. She estimates between 11:14 and 11:15 PM. Her clock is one minute fast as we had found out during this interview. She states that no cars were going in either direction while she

STATEMENT: STELLA MEDEIROS 12/24/68 11:25 AM
was on the road. When she arrived at the scene, headlights picked up the car and she observed a boy and he looked like he had fallen out of the open door. The girl was lying on her side facing the road. She had a purple dress on and looked well dressed. She saw only one car at the scene. It looked like a Rambler, grayish in color, it had a chrome rack on the top. This fits the description of the FARADAY Rambler. She states that she drove sixty or seventy miles an hour enroute to Benicia to report the incident. When she saw the police car she honked her horn and blinked her lights to attract the attention of the police officers.

Stewart. Best lived in the Bay Area during the 1960s and died in Mexico City in 1984; he is most widely known in the case through Stewart’s 2014 book The Most Dangerous Animal of All and the 2020 FX/Hulu docuseries of the same name, both of which advanced the claim that Best was the Zodiac Killer, a claim that has been widely disputed by reporters and researchers and not adopted by law enforcement.

Early life and background
- Education and interests: Best graduated from San Francisco’s Lowell High School in the 1950s and studied criminology at City College of San Francisco before working as a rare‑book dealer.
- “Ice Cream Romance” scandal (1961–1962): At age 28, Best began a predatory relationship with a 13–14‑year‑old girl, Judith “Judy/Jude” Chandler, whom he met outside an ice cream shop; the San Francisco press covered the case and dubbed it the “Ice Cream Romance.” After an elopement and annulment, subsequent flights across state lines, and a hospital escape episode, Best was arrested and imprisoned for statutory rape; the Chronicle’s coverage included a 1962 jail interview where Best downplayed the age difference, saying, “I love Judy and she loves me”.
- Baton Rouge abandonment (1963): While on the run, the couple’s infant son (later named Gary Stewart) was abandoned in a Baton Rouge apartment building stairwell; both Best and Chandler were subsequently taken into custody by authorities, and Stewart was adopted locally, events documented decades later by The Advocate’s reporting around Stewart’s book.
- Scene and associations: After parole, Best returned to San Francisco and, according to contemporaneous accounts later summarized by the San Francisco Chronicle/SFGATE, socialized with Anton LaVey (Church of Satan) and played music with Bobby Beausoleil, who was later convicted in a Manson‑related murder in Los Angeles—color that reflects his circles but does not connect him to the Zodiac crimes.

Role in the Zodiac case
Best was not publicly a Zodiac suspect during the original investigation. Decades later, his son Gary L. Stewart advanced the theory that Best matched the Zodiac composite sketch and elements of the letters, first in the 2014 book The Most Dangerous Animal of All and then in the 2020 FX/Hulu docuseries; these works brought Best’s name into the modern suspect lists and public discourse.
Major Bay Area reporting contemporaneous with the docuseries characterized the evidence as scant, largely circumstantial, and often rebutted (including contested handwriting comparisons and lack of verifiable links to crime scenes). Reporters concluded there was “almost no evidence” that Best was the Zodiac, and the series itself ultimately undercut the theory; law enforcement has not confirmed Best as a suspect in the case, which remains officially unsolved.
Later life and death
- Best died in Mexico City in 1984; press accounts summarize that he had a record that included convictions related to the 1962 case and other charges from later years. Public reporting places no verified nexus between his death in Mexico and the Zodiac case.
- Family accounts and secondary records state he was buried in an unmarked grave in Mexico City; some compiled records list administrative receipt dates different from the reported date of death, which is common with international filings.

Errata
- Best’s life intersected with notable Bay Area subcultures (Satanic Temple circles, underground music), and his later notoriety stems from true‑crime media: the bestselling book The Most Dangerous Animal of All (2014) and the FX/Hulu docuseries (2020), both centered on Stewart’s investigation and the Zodiac’s enduring cultural footprint.
 -The “Ice Cream Romance” was covered in 1962 by Chronicle police reporter Paul Avery, who later became well known for his Zodiac reporting. In a notable coincidence frequently cited in coverage, Judith Chandler later married Rotea Gilford, an SFPD homicide detective who worked high‑profile cases; this connection has been reported as background but is not evidence of Best’s involvement in the Zodiac crimes.",,,"""Earl Van Best arrested for """"child stealing"""""",Earl Van Best & child bride are on the run,""Earl Van Best sentenced for """"Ice Cream Romance""""""",8/1/1962,"San Francisco,Mexico City","San Francisco,San Francisco,""New Orleans, LA""","San Francisco,California,SF Bay Area,United States of America",https://zodiackiller.fandom.com/wiki/Earl_Van_Best,,,,https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Earl%20Van%20Best%2C%20Jr.&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=,https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Earl%20Van%20Best%2C%20Jr.&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2,,"Gary L.

He thoroughly enjoyed his retirement years by working part time with his friends at Pridmore Brothers Construction Company as well as gardening, hunting, cooking and baking bread, which he generously shared with family and friends.

sitting for Dean and Darlene Ferrin. Again, reiterated the months were from January through May of 1969. Stated she quit in May to overcome some guilt that she was feeling about covering up for Darlene's running around with other men while she was married to Dean. One of the men mentioned was the surviving victim in the Vallejo homicide Michael Mageau.

Karen relates one incident that allegedly occurred while she was babysitting in approximately February or March 1969 at 560 Wallace. She stated she was babysitting approximately 10:00 p.m. one night, was looking out the front window of the Ferrin's apartment, and she noticed a man whom she took to be middleaged sitting in a white American-made sedan watching the apartment. She stated he was there for several hours but left before Dean returned from work shortly after midnight. She stated she could not really describe this individual and only knew he was middleaged because he either turned on the inside car light or lit a cigarette so that she got a partial look at the man. She did not note the license number and was only certain of the approximate age - middleaged, and the fact that the sedan was white.

The following day she related this incident to Darlene Ferrin who at the time recalled was in the bathroom putting on her makeup to go out. Darlene asked her what the car and the man looked like, and after relating a description to her, Dee said something to the effect, ""I guess he's checking up on me again. I heard he was back from out of state."" Followed by, ""He doesn't want anyone to know what I (meaning Darlene) saw him do. I saw him murder someone.""

Karen stated that Dee sometime during this conversation mentioned the man's name, and that the first name was very short, three or four letters and that the second name was just slightly longer. The name was quite common. Karen stated that Dee appeared to be genuinely frightened of this individual.

and mentioned sometime that he had been checking up on her at Terry's Restaurant where Darlene was employed.

At the conclusion of her statement, Reporting Officer discussed with Karen the possibility of her recalling exactly what the name might have been, and a better description of the individual if she were to undergo hypnosis. Stated that she never had any experience with this, but that she would be willing to submit to anything that may assist in the investigation. At this time Reporting Officer advised Karen that arrangements would be made for a session with a hypnotist to see if we could produce more information, and that Reporting Officer would be in contact.

On 6-15-77, Reporting Officer contacted Lieutenant Larry Haynes, Concord Police Department, phone 415-671-3030, in regards to the hypnotic session. Lieutenant Haynes has been trained in this by the Law Enforcement Hypnotic Institute in Los Angeles Police Department and has had much experience in this area. When asked as to the feasibility of such an examination with an 8-year time span, Lieutenant Haynes replied much success has been had regardless of the number of years that has passed. Advised Lieutenant Haynes that the interview primarily would focus on Karen's ability to recall a name told to her by the Zodiac victim Darlene Ferrin and possibly focus on a painting party that occurred at Darlene Ferrin's residence where possibly the alleged subject was in attendance. Lieutenant Haynes agreed to assist. An appointment was made for 6-16-77 at 1300 hours. Reporting Officer then re-contacted Karen [REDACTED], advised her of the appointment set for 1300 hours. She agreed to meet Reporting Officer at the Vallejo Police Department.",The Painting Party,,Vallejo Police interview with Karen re: Andrew Todd Walker,6/10/1977,"""Vallejo, CA""",,"""Vallejo, CA"",""Solano County, CA"",California,SF Bay Area,United States of America",,,,,https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Karen%20%28Ellendy%3F%29&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=,https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Karen%20%28Ellendy%3F%29&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2,,,,,Darlene Ferrin's babysitter,,6,10/20/2025 11:20am,9/28/2025 7:45pm,,recqnMabDxM7bibg6

He lived in Riverside around the time of the murder of Cheri Jo Bates, and he stayed at an apartment in San Francisco that was not far from the murder scene of Paul Stine. He also worked for the KTIM radio station, where the call letters supposedly look like the same cryptic symbols that the Zodiac used in his letters.
Marshall's prints did not match the fingerprints that were collected from the Zodiac leters or crime scenes. However, this evidence can't conclusively rule him out as a suspect because we don't know everything. Marshall's handwriting had some notable similarities to that of the Zodiac.

Kjell Qvale, who fell in love with a forest-green, wire-wheel MG sports car in the 1940s and went on to become one of the earliest American importers of European cars, ultimately selling a million automobiles as a distributor and dealer, died on Nov. 1 in San Francisco. He was 94.
His family announced the death.
As a recently discharged Navy veteran, the Norwegian-born Kjell Qvale (pronounced shell KAH-vah-leh) entered the car business in 1946, using $8,500 in savings to invest in a Jeep dealership in Alameda, Calif. He had no particular passion for cars at the time; to him, this was strictly a business proposition.
It was also strictly business when he made a trip to New Orleans to meet with an importer to discuss expanding his line by adding James motorcycles, a not-terribly-fast British make known for its Jeep-like practicality. There, Mr. Qvale found himself standing on a street corner when “this goofy-looking car pulls up to the curb in front of me,” he said in an interview in 2008. He asked the driver where it was made.
“England,” the driver said.
The car was the MG, and the driver turned out to be the importer of motorcycles he had come to see. He gave Mr. Qvale a ride.
It also turned out that the importer was looking for someone to market MGs in Northern California. Mr. Qvale returned to Alameda, which is just south of Oakland, Calif., sold the Jeep franchise and became an MG distributor.
The MG, the first imported sports car to appear in significant numbers on American highways, has been called “the sports car America loved first.” Its precision handling, accurate steering and zip made going to the grocery store a pleasure.
“It’s fun to drive,” Mr. Qvale told The Wall Street Journal in 1960.
In 2005, the trade publication Automotive News said the MG’s postwar popularity in the United States “was largely because of one man, Kjell Qvale.” It characterized him as “the most imaginative and probably the hardest-working” importer.
Mr. Qvale added more British cars — Aston Martin, Austin, Austin-Healey, Jaguar, Morris, Bentley and Rolls-Royce — and became the exclusive distributor of these brands in Northern California and other parts of the West. (His dealership sold more Austin-Healey 3000s than any other American.) He later added the German cars Volkswagen and Porsche and, later still, Japanese makes.
At his peak, around 1970, he operated 100 dealerships. He estimated that as a wholesale distributor and retail dealer, he sold a million cars representing 36 makes.
Mr. Qvale’s impact in popularizing sportier, more luxurious European cars in the West is often compared to that of Max Hoffman, the celebrated New York car importer who commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright to design his Manhattan showroom.
Mr. Qvale, like Mr. Hoffman, overcame stiff obstacles. He persuaded reluctant banks to finance his unfamiliar breeds of car and insurance companies to insure them. He also had the logistically demanding task of providing parts and service for the foreign brands.
He promoted sports cars by sponsoring rallies, time trials and other competitions. In 1949, he organized the first postwar sports car race in the West at Buchanan Field in Concord, Calif. The next year, he was chairman of the first sports car race in the forest at Pebble Beach, Calif. To accompany the race, he proposed a show of classic cars; it became the Pebble Beach Concours d’Élégance, one of the top events in the world for car collectors.
In 1956, when the Pebble Beach race moved to nearby Fort Ord, an Army base, Mr. Qvale contributed to the design of its famously treacherous corkscrew at turns 8 and 8A of what is now Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca. He also organized a sports car race on the public roads of Golden Gate Park in San Francisco and teamed up with the racecar designer Joe Huffaker to race MGs at Indianapolis in the mid-1960s.
Kjell Qvale was born on July 17, 1919, in Trondheim, Norway, about 225 miles north of Oslo. His father, Bjarne, was a sea captain who commanded a freighter that operated between Chile and Seattle. The elder Mr. Qvale decided to leave the merchant marine and settle in the Pacific Northwest because it reminded him of Norway. Kjell was 10 when his mother took him and his four siblings to join their father.
As a boy, Kjell sold vegetable graters and phonograph needles door to door and had a newspaper delivery route. He was a track star in high school and won an athletic scholarship to the University of Washington, where he was captain of the track team. He once ran the 100-yard dash in 9.6 seconds in a collegiate meet.
He joined the Navy after Pearl Harbor and flew transport planes in the Pacific during World War II. A wartime friend who was the San Francisco-area distributor for Willys-Overland Motors, which made Jeeps, helped him get the Alameda franchise.
In 1970, Mr. Qvale teamed up with the car designer Donald Healey to buy Jensen Motors, and together they developed the Jensen-Healey, a powerful sports car with a Lotus 907 engine. They sold the car from 1972 to 1976. As majority shareholder in Jensen Motors, Mr. Qvale also sought to acquire Rolls-Royce but was unsuccessful.
In 1998, Mr. Qvale and his sons, Jeff and Bruce, bought the rights to make the DeTomaso Mangusta, a high-performance sports car. They made and sold several hundred before selling the rights and manufacturing plant to the MG Rover group in 2001.
Mr. Qvale’s other business interests included Brittania Jeans and the First National Bank of Marin. He bred and raced thoroughbreds and for a time owned the renowned come-from-behind racehorse Silky Sullivan. He also financed women’s professional tennis.
Mr. Qvale’s wife of 57 years (and his business associate for even longer), the former Kay Curry, died in 2005. He is survived by his sons, seven grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
Always eager to try something new, Mr. Qvale started taking piano lessons at 90.",,,,,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/business/kjell-qvale-an-instigator-of-americas-love-of-sports-cars-dies-at-94.html,,,,https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Kjell%20Qvale&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=,https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Kjell%20Qvale&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2,,,,,Wealthy suspect promoted by Mike Rodelli.,,6,10/18/2025 10:57am,10/18/2025 10:57am,,recuPRjkErUcTsZuD
Xenophon Lusby Anthony,"Suspect,Deceased",image.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/50/50/1771178400000/tuUGrSUp_UeCbiMSYyn4EQ/9rF8Qx9zuYYNdc2mYXgRSVyqOKISmuORl3tFEF1XwSYd-m4rlwpKfQGEMPp6QpBSpBgVPu646kHbgYMw3DHdeAG46fRJNbGu9dlpWOb6FMP3_UU71jZfjB0c-RsZNmjN5-qEVTdwN3eEM-SSRVyhAg/DKCpk2MK5mbPfXoW_VOOyuW-ZnmfB3NEPgzwG6KuXjA),1/28/1931,1/17/2016,"Xenophon Lusby Anthony was born in Spokane, Washington, to Dr. Marc Anthony and Ruth Anthony. He received his early education at Lakeside School in Seattle, graduating in 1949. Lakeside School is a prestigious private preparatory school whose notable alumni include Microsoft co-founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen. Anthony went on to attend Harvard University, graduating in 1953.
PERSONAL LIFE
In 1956, Anthony married Valerie Ann Moore in California. The couple initially lived in San Marino, California for ten years before relocating to San Francisco, which became their long-time home. They also maintained a second residence in Inverness, located in the Point Reyes National Seashore area, where Anthony enjoyed landscaping and remodeling projects.
Anthony and Valerie had two sons: Peter Anthony (who predeceased him) and Marc Anthony. He was also survived by his grandson Jason Anthony, sister Harriet Botelho, and brother James Anthony.
PROFESSIONAL CAREER
Anthony worked in retail and wholesale businesses until 1976. That year marked a significant change when his wife Valerie founded Sterne School, a San Francisco institution dedicated to educating children with learning differences. Anthony became the school's Business Manager, taking on multiple responsibilities including building maintenance and general operations. The couple retired in 2000 and divided their time between Inverness and Spokane before making Spokane their permanent home in 2005.
CONNECTION TO THE ZODIAC KILLER CASE
The Paul Stine Murder
On October 11, 1969, San Francisco taxi driver Paul Stine was shot and killed in his cab at the intersection of Washington and Cherry Streets in the Presidio Heights neighborhood. This murder became the last confirmed killing attributed to the Zodiac Killer.
Witness Identification
Anthony's connection to the case emerged through a Department of Justice document dated November 6, 1969, which was later released through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. The document states: ""FOR INFO IDENT DIVISION, SAN FRANCISCO PD ADVISED EIGHT YEAR OLD WITNESS IN MURDER OF CAB DRIVER IDENTIFIED XENOPHON L. ANTHONY AS POSSIBLE SUBJECT IN THIS MATTER"".
At the time of the Stine murder, Anthony was 38 years old and resided at 3218 Jackson Street in San Francisco. This address was located in close proximity to the crime scene—approximately five and a half blocks from Washington and Cherry Streets.
Geographic Context
Anthony's residence at 3218 Jackson Street placed him between Presidio Avenue and Walnut Street, literally off Presidio Avenue where Officer Donald Fouke's patrol car had come from on the night of the murder. Officer Fouke reported encountering a white male adult in the area shortly after the murder, though the suspect description was initially miscommunicated to responding officers.
Age and Physical Description
Anthony's age in 1969 (38 years old) fell within the range described by Officer Fouke, who estimated the suspect he observed was between 35-45 years old. This alignment with witness descriptions added to the interest in Anthony as a potential suspect.
Investigation Status
The name ""Xenophon L. Anthony"" was not publicly released until 2016, following Anthony's death in January of that year. Under privacy laws, the Department of Justice was able to release the previously redacted name because deceased individuals are exempt from such protections, following the Latin legal maxim ""Actio personalis moritur cum persona"" (a personal action dies with the person).
The extent of the San Francisco Police Department's investigation into Anthony remains unclear. No official police reports from October 1969 mention the eight-year-old witness or Anthony's identification. Inspector Armond Pelissetti's report from the night of the incident, which listed three teenage witnesses by name, made no mention of either the child witness or Anthony.
LATER LIFE AND DEATH
Anthony spent his final years in Spokane, Washington, where he resided at Touchmark's Skilled Nursing Unit for the last nineteen months of his life. He died on January 17, 2016, at the age of 84. Memorial contributions were directed to Sterne School at 2690 Jackson Street, San Francisco, the institution he and his wife had dedicated much of their lives to building.
CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CONTEXT
The Zodiac Killer case remains one of America's most infamous unsolved serial murder investigations. The killer claimed responsibility for at least 37 murders in letters sent to newspapers, though investigators have confirmed seven assault victims. The case has generated thousands of suspects over the decades, with approximately 2,300 individuals investigated by authorities.
Anthony's emergence as a named suspect decades after the crimes highlights the ongoing nature of the investigation and the continued efforts by researchers to identify previously unknown leads. However, no definitive evidence has publicly emerged linking Anthony to the Zodiac crimes, and he was never charged with any offense related to the case.",,11/8/1969 DoJ Ident Division teletype re: Xen Anthony and Robert Hale West,,,"San Francisco,""Inverness, CA"",""Spokane, WA""",,"San Francisco,California,SF Bay Area,United States of America,""Inverness, CA"",""Marin County, CA""","https://zodiackiller.fandom.com/wiki/Xenophon_Anthony

"Giuseppe ""Joe"" Bevilacqua",Suspect,,,12/23/2022,"Via Wikipedia
In 2017, Italian journalist Francesco Amicone conducted an investigation that implicated Giuseppe ""Joe"" Bevilacqua, a retired U.S. Army sergeant and former superintendent of the Florence American Cemetery and Memorial, as a suspect in both the Zodiac and Monster of Florence (Il Mostro di Firenze) cases.[21][22][23] Bevilacqua had previously testified at the trial of suspect Pietro Pacciani in 1994.[24][25] Starting in May 2017, Bevilacqua and Amicone began having multiple meetings; according to Amicone, Bevilacqua implied his responsibility for both cases in phone correspondence. Bevilacqua agreed with Amicone's request to turn himself in but later changed his mind. Citing professional ethics reasons, Amicone did not record the conversation.[25][23] Amicone's inquiry was published in multiple Italian newspapers,[21][22][25] and has been continued since then on his blog.[23] Italian authorities dismissed their investigation into Bevilacqua in 2021.[26] He died on December 23, 2022.[27] Amicone claimed a DNA profile was sent to U.S. authorities investigating the Zodiac case in November 2023.[28][29]

Starting in April 1969 the San Francisco Express Times changed its name to Good Times, publishing under that title with a substantially different editorial policy, lasting until August 2, 1972.[2] In 2021, Newsweek referred to Good Times as an ""anti-police and pro-violence"" publication.[3]

Publication history

Express Times
Marvin Garson was a graduate of the University of California and a veteran of the Berkeley Free Speech Movement, where he edited an FSM newsletter, Wooden Shoe, along with his wife Barbara Garson. He started the Express Times with co-founder Bob Novick.[4] Some members of the San Francisco Oracle collective were also involved in the paper's birth.
The Express Times featured a weekly cooking column, 30 Recipes Suitable for Framing, written by Alice Waters and illustrated by David Lance Goines.[5] Regular contributors included Todd Gitlin, Greil Marcus, Paul Williams, Sandy Darlington, and Marjorie Heins.[6] Catherine Yronwode, later known for her work in the comics industry, co-wrote a weekly astrology column for the Express Times. Staff photographers were Jeffrey Blankfort, followed by Nacio Jan Brown and Robert Altman. Cartoons and illustrations were provided by Jaxon, the syndicated editorial cartoons of Ron Cobb, and Sharon Rudahl.[7]
During the year of its existence, highlights included extensive on-the-scene coverage of student rioting and the prolonged strike at San Francisco State University, and Lenny Heller's serialized novel of guerrilla warfare in the United States, Berkeley Guns.
In December 1968 editor Marvin Garson spent 20 days in jail in Chicago as a result of his participation as a journalist in a police and protester skirmish during the Democratic National Convention in August.[8]
Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act show that the Express Times was one of a number of underground newspapers successfully infiltrated by the FBI, which had a paid informant on the staff.[9]

Good Times
The renamed Good Times paper debuted in April 1969; the all-volunteer editorial collective was made up of residents of the Good Times Commune.[10] Under this regime, the paper's contents and publication schedule were a good deal more relaxed than when it was the San Francisco Express Times.[citation needed]
Jesse Drew of the San Francisco digital archive Found SF described Good Times this way:
Good Times was the paper the radical left depended upon to keep up with the anti-war movement, the trials of political prisoners like the Soledad Brothers and Angela Davis, political corruption in San Francisco, and general communal information like vegetarian recipes and holistic health care. The all-volunteer collective put out Good Times on a regular bi-weekly, weekly, and then twice-a-week basis until sputtering out in the summer of 1972.[11]
Underground cartoonist Harry Driggs served as Good Times's art director and staff cartoonist; he recruited fellow underground cartoonists Trina Robbins[12] and Guy Colwell[13] as contributors (Collwell, in fact, joined the Good Times Commune).[13] Writer Nina Serrano wrote a series of articles on the Los Siete trial and contributed poetry to Good Times.
When Good Times decided to accept pornographic display advertising and classified sex trade advertising in early 1970, feminist staff members staged an action to prevent this from happening.[citation needed] When male staffers at Good Times tried to put out a special ""Sex"" issue, women staffers stole the mock-ups and page layouts and burned them.[citation needed]

Legacy
In 1977, Allan Francovich and Gene Rosow produced and directed a documentary on the newspaper titled San Francisco Good Times, which included appearances by such notable figures as Pete Townsend of The Who and Timothy Leary.[14]
Connection to the Zodiac Killer case
The History Channel's 2009 television program MysteryQuest speculated that a member of the Good Times Commune, Richard Gaikowski (1936–2004), was a possible suspect in the unsolved San Francisco Zodiac Killer case.[10] His appearance resembled a composite sketch of the killer, and a police dispatcher who had been contacted by the Zodiac, identified a recording of Gaikowski's voice as being the same as the Zodiac's.[15]
In 2021, Newsweek published an article that also mentioned Gaikowski in relation to the Zodiac killings.[3]",,,,,San Francisco,,"San Francisco,California,SF Bay Area,United States of America",,,Richard Joseph Gaikowski,,https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Good%20Times%20%28San%20Francisco%20alt-weekly%29&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=,https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Good%20Times%20%28San%20Francisco%20alt-weekly%29&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2,,,,,,,5,10/20/2025 11:19am,9/7/2025 11:33am,,rect1e5f4rMTIvKe8

Herb Caen,Media,,4/3/1916,2/1/1997,"Veteran San Francisco Chronicle columnist known as “Mr. San Francisco”; directly referenced in a disputed Zodiac letter sent to the Chronicle in 1978.
Herbert Eugene “Herb” Caen was a celebrated San Francisco journalist whose daily column ran for nearly six decades, primarily in the San Francisco Chronicle, with a brief period at the San Francisco Examiner; he became a defining voice of the city and received a special Pulitzer Prize in 1996 for his “continuing contribution as a voice and conscience of his city.” He was born in Sacramento on April 3, 1916, and spent most of his professional life in San Francisco, where his three-dot, item-by-item columns mixed local news, culture, and wit; he is credited with coining or popularizing terms like “beatnik” and “hippie,” underscoring his cultural reach. In the context of the Zodiac case, Caen was name-checked in an April 24, 1978 letter sent to the Chronicle—“Tell herb caen I am here”—a communication widely deemed a forgery by a majority of experts; nonetheless, it illustrates how the Zodiac correspondence engaged with Chronicle figures and the paper’s prominence in the case. Caen died in San Francisco on February 1, 1997.

Events:
- April 24, 1978: A letter attributed to “Zodiac” arrives at the San Francisco Chronicle; it states, “Tell herb caen I am here,” and is later widely regarded as a forgery by most experts.
- 1996: Receives a special Pulitzer Prize for his role as “voice and conscience” of San Francisco, reflecting his longstanding influence as a Chronicle columnist during and beyond the Zodiac era.

Relatives:
- Parents: Lucien Caen and Augusta (Gross) Caen.

Groups a member of or places worked:
- San Francisco Chronicle (columnist, longtime home of his daily column).
- The San Francisco Examiner (columnist, 1950–1958).
- United States Army Air Forces (World War II service).

Cultural links:
- Popularized “hippie” and coined “beatnik”; widely known as “Mr. San Francisco,” highlighting his cultural stature in the city whose newspaper the Zodiac used for major communications.

IF YOU CAME of age in California in the 1960s and were fortunate in your life choices, you no doubt at one time or another experienced the Renaissance Pleasure Faire. Although it originated in 1963 in Southern California’s Agoura Hills (over 3,000 people attended), the Northern California Renaissance Pleasure Faire also had a memorable run. That one started at Marin’s China Camp State Park in 1967 and by 1970 had moved to Novato’s hilly Black Point area, where the above photo was taken.
Of course, the fair was headlined as taking place at Black Pointe Forest, for more authentic 16th-century English country flavor. Fair personnel, all 2,500 of them on average, attended 30 different classes and workshops in Elizabethan style and folklore and, once the fair began, wore period attire, including ruffs, jerkins and snoods. Booths in pastoral settings sold handicrafts of the bygone era, madrigal singers entertained and food stands offered fattened turkey legs and tankards of dark ale.
The Renaissance Pleasure Faire was born in the minds of Ron and Phyllis Patterson, an art director and art teacher, respectively; both were adamant that Renaissance history and customs be presented as accurately as possible. The couple lived for many years in Marin and divorced in 1980, and their brainchild was sold in 1994; today, imitator renaissance fairs are held throughout the world. Ron died at age 80 in 2011 while living in a Sausalito floating home; Phyllis, who lived in a log cabin in Novato, passed away in 2014 at 82. Their son Kevin, who grew up during the Renaissance Pleasure Faire’s most successful years and later was active in the business, still lives in Marin. He and his family manage San Francisco’s annual Dickens Christmas Fair.",Renaissance Fairs,"A Visit To The 1969 Renaissance Pleasure Faire,Renaissance Pleasure Faire Traffic Congestion","3rd Annual Renaissance Pleasure Faire,1st Annual Renaissance Pleasure Fair in San Rafael,2nd Annual Renaissance Pleasure Faire,4th Annual Renaissance Pleasure Faire,9/27 Renaissance Pleasure Faire",10/7/1967,China Camp (Renaissance Pleasure Faire Site),"China Camp (Renaissance Pleasure Faire Site),China Camp (Renaissance Pleasure Faire Site),China Camp (Renaissance Pleasure Faire Site),China Camp (Renaissance Pleasure Faire Site),China Camp (Renaissance Pleasure Faire Site)","China Camp (Renaissance Pleasure Faire Site),""San Rafael, CA"",""Marin County, CA"",California,SF Bay Area,United States of America",,,,,https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Northern%20California%20Renaissance%20Pleasure%20Faire&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=,https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Northern%20California%20Renaissance%20Pleasure%20Faire&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2,"Northern Renaissance Pleasure Faire 1967 Programme,Northern Renaissance Pleasure Faire 1968 Programme,Northern Renaissance Pleasure Faire 1969 Programme,Northern Renaissance Pleasure Faire 1970 Programme",,,,,,5,10/20/2025 11:19am,9/28/2025 11:57am,,recFjCYNvW74IINvL

Like most of their neighbors, the Gassers were farmers, and for many years his father was the head dairyman at Napa State Hospital. At their ranch in Coombsville, the family had their own prune orchard, raised turkeys and chickens, and operated a dairy with goats and cows. The Gasser dairy was known for neatness and modern methods of operation, and working in it throughout his childhood taught the young Peter plenty about hard work. In high school, he was annoyed when other boys teased him about his rustic clothes, and left after ninth grade, but he soon went on to earn a banking certificate in San Francisco. He began working for the Bank of Italy (which was to become the Bank of America) in 1925.
Pete’s new job brought him into contact with bankers, local business owners, and other men of influence and power. It also allowed him to dress the part of the promising young businessman, and he impressed the young widow Vernice Wilson, whom he began escorting around Napa. The two were married in 1934. Pete Gasser soon left banking, telling friends that the Bank of America “wouldn’t let him run it the way he wanted to,” and went into business selling used cars in Napa, perhaps with his father’s help. After a rocky beginning he opened his own Dodge agency, promoted with a splashy opening that featured live vaudeville, free movies and branded souvenirs. The agency also sponsored a winning basketball team, who were provided with fine uniforms and chauffeured to the games in shiny late model Dodge cars. Pete Gasser was a natural business promoter, and became known around Napa as the man to talk to for a good deal on an automobile. But Napa suffered big losses during the Depression, and Mr. Gasser felt that the town needed direction from the Chamber of Commerce, which had lost drive and membership, in order to recover and prosper.
As his own business gradually gathered momentum, Pete Gasser gave the Chamber of Commerce new vitality and purpose. Starting as a member-at-large in 1938, he soon moved up to president from 1941-45, and remained influential for a long time afterward. With the national economy beginning to recover, and the possibility of another war in Europe on the horizon, Mr. Gasser insisted that the group take an active part in improving the city – pressuring for annexation of surrounding areas to accommodate new workers, arranging construction of infrastructure, and asking members to build housing for the booming population. The Chamber’s powerful voice was effective in directing Napa development before and during World War II. Under their auspices, Gasser facilitated the widening of Highway 29 between Napa and Vallejo and helped envisage the Napa airport. He was influential in negotiating with the federal government to construct wartime housing, and lobbied for dredging the channel from Carquinez Straits to Napa. At the same time he expanded his own business dealings into heavy trucks and other vehicles. He invested in other local businesses, notably Basalt Rock Company, bought more real estate, and brokered deals for the city.
Though he never ran for elected office, Gasser himself was a major force for change in Napa, with business and civic projects that became almost too numerous to track between 1940 and 1975. His opinions influenced the mayor, supervisors and newspaper, and his influence, or lack of it, could make a project succeed or fail. As president of the Chamber, he was War Fund chairman for the American Red Cross, and was cited for distinguished achievement in raising funds for the group to support troops overseas. He helped bring the Oakland Oaks baseball team to Napa for spring training.
Gasser served on the advisory boards of the Bank of America, Silverado Council of the Boy Scouts, Napa Farm Bureau, and Native Sons of the Golden West, and promoted their interests through the Chamber of Commerce. He presided over the establishment of Robert Louis Stevenson State Park. Following his predecessor Nathan Coombs, Mr. Gasser served on the Golden Gate Bridge Authority, and represented Napa interests to the mayor and supervisors of San Francisco for twenty years. He became director of the Redwood Empire Association, and acted as co-chairman of fundraising efforts to build Queen of the Valley Hospital. He was a generous benefactor of Justin-Siena School. In later years, he helped expedite construction of the Southern Crossing via the Butler bridge south of Napa, a major transit project. In 1965, he sold Gasser Motors to devote himself to real estate and Napa Valley development. The Napa Register’s story quoted him saying that the development of the Napa Valley was “in its infancy,” and that “tremendous growth would be coming to the area in the very near future, after such needs as sanitation, adequate water for industry and domestic use and recreational needs were solved.” With increasing financial resources at hand, Pete Gasser purchased land for many more projects, including the remainder of the 145 acre site of today’s South Napa Marketplace. He envisioned the area along Soscol Avenue between Napa State Hospital and downtown as a major shopping area for the city, and began looking for businesses to make his dream a reality.
Throughout the years, Pete Gasser approached relaxation as he did business–with gusto, in the company of many colleagues and friends. He was known for his “big” personality, and success allowed him to enjoy himself in the rollicking style of his era. An enthusiastic hunter and fisherman who loved the outdoors, he had special fences constructed on his property to accommodate the native deer, and was a major supporter of Ducks Unlimited. He had his pond stocked with rainbow trout, hunted deer in Nevada, and took a state senator salmon fishing in Alaska; he even hunted a polar bear. He also greatly enjoyed golf and was a charter member and the first president of the Silverado Country Club. While keeping his finger on the pulse of Napa, he became the larger than life figure that he clearly wanted to be.
There were the ranch hands he bailed out of jail; the employee with bad credit whom he still backed. Success did not rob him of the pleasure of doing favors for his friends. Yet more than anything else he was an astute businessman who relished envisioning projects and bringing them to fruition. He enjoyed knowing the right people to get things done, and working with them to accomplish the job. In his later days Gasser told a friend that he “hoped to leave something to the world so that I’ll be remembered.” The Gassers had no children, and as Pete had made his money in Napa, he wanted his inheritance to benefit the Napa community. He directed that his legacy be planned in the same way he had lived: carefully, strategically, and with Napa interests at heart. The Gasser Foundation continues the work that Pete would have done himself by contributing to all levels of the Napa community, because–to the end–Pete Gasser believed in Napa, and insisted that this commitment also be put “in black and white.”
The Gasser Foundation, surely, is something wonderfully generous for all Napa citizens to remember him by. Napa native Vernice Gasser was a daughter of the prominent Stoddard family, who arrived in California by wagon train from Michigan in 1871. Her grandfather, William Stoddard, settled in Napa in 1880, and with his sons soon established a prosperous grain and feed business which became one of the largest in the region, milling barley and corn. Vernice’s father, William Stoddard, Jr., died when she was only eleven, leaving her French-born mother Isabelle Ilos Stoddard to carry on the milling business. Though placed in an unusual position for a woman of her time, Mrs. Stoddard proved to be an outstanding manager of business affairs. She became a mortgage lender, began to acquire real estate, and advised other businesses on matters of finance; she worked at Napa’s department store (Albert’s), taught knitting there and in her home, and did volunteer work at the hospital.
In many ways Vernice, who preferred to be called Pat, was to follow her mother in her civic and business interests. Women of her era were beginning to assume greater responsibilities outside the home, and participating, though often behind the scenes, in business decisions. She attended business school in Oakland, where she received a certificate in bookkeeping and typing, and took her first job at Mare Island Naval Yard in 1920. She married John Wilson of Suisun, but after his sudden death in 1930 she returned to Napa and worked as office manager at Albert’s department store. Four years later, she married the up-and-coming young businessman Pete Gasser, and in 1937, the two opened Gasser Motors Dodge Cars & Trucks’ new showroom with a staff of thirty-one. Mrs. Gasser was in charge of bookkeeping and managed the office.
She had done volunteer work during World War I, and when World War II came she again became involved with the Red Cross and other charities. One of them began as “Bundles for Britain”, a war relief organization supporting British servicemen early in World War II; it later supported U.S. servicemen. Pat and other volunteers opened a salvage shop that proved to be such a fundraising success that the group continued to operate after the war on behalf of the Napa community. Pat Gasser was a founding member of the group, now known as Community Projects, and it became her major focus. Over the years she served in the capacities of CP president, treasurer, thrift shop chairman and hospital auxiliary chair, and under her direction an invitation to join CP became a coveted honor. She also spearheaded the purchase of CP’s current location as an investment for the organization. The organization made her a life member in 1986. Outside of Community Projects, Pat Gasser helped raise funds and served as trustee for the Queen of the Valley Hospital Foundation, and was named Woman of the Year by the Napa Business and Professional Women’s Club in recognition of her work for the town.
Pat was an enthusiastic gardener, regularly winning ribbons for her flowers at the Napa Town & Country Fair. She retained a childhood love of horses, and in 1939 helped to organize the Napa Valley Horsemen’s Association. Known around town as a stylish dresser with a taste for beautiful things, she was also an adventurous world traveler, venturing abroad to Asia, South America, and several regions of Africa. Though at heart the dynamic Mrs. Gasser and her husband Pete were intensely private individuals, both felt a lifelong affection for Napa. Mrs. Gasser agreed that establishing the Gasser Foundation as a charitable entity would be the finest and most enduring legacy they could leave their community. When she died in 1989, seven years after her husband, Mrs. Gasser had made sure that these dreams would become a reality. As in life, her closest and most abiding connection was with her hometown.",,,,,"""Napa, CA""",,"""Queen of the Valley Hospital (Napa, CA)"",""Napa, CA"",California,""Napa County, CA"",SF Bay Area,United States of America",,,,,https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Peter%20Gasser&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=,https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Peter%20Gasser&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2,,Frank Gasser,Frank Gasser,,,,4,10/20/2025 11:19am,9/13/2025 9:38pm,,recrqrgr0v20CdvFG

OBITUARY
Jan. 7, 1921 – Feb. 1, 2009 Attorney William Langley Beeman died on February 1 at Kaiser Hospital in Vallejo. He was 88 years old.
Bill was born on January 7, 1921, in Fort Worth, Texas. He was the 10th of 10 children of Edwin A. and Lucille E. (Shoemake) Beeman. In his early childhood, the family lived on a farm outside of Golden, Oklahoma. Bill moved to Vallejo the first time with his mother, brother Jack and sister Ruth in October of 1928, residing in Hudson Alley. While attending Lincoln Elementary School and Vallejo Junior High School, he helped to support his family by selling newspapers for five years, seven days a week.
In 1933, Bill moved with his mother and brother Jack to Old Town, in San Diego, where he again sold newspapers for most of his high school years. He graduated from Point Loma High School in 1939 and then attended San Diego State College.
While attending college, he worked as a night watchman for the Bill Gibbs Flying School, being paid with flying lessons. Discovering an enormous love of flying, he quickly obtained his commercial and flight instructors’ licenses. Prior to World War II, he taught flying for the Civilian Pilot Training Program in the Imperial Valley. In June of 1941 he became a flight instructor at Falcon Field in Mesa, Arizona, teaching Royal Air Force cadets skills in primary, basic and advanced flying.
In June of 1942, Bill went to work as a co-pilot for Consairway in San Diego, delivering PBYs and B-24s for the war effort. In 1943, he then became a flight captain for Consairway. Flying under contract for the Army and Navy Transport Commands, Bill’s responsibilities took him through the entire South Pacific, including Australia, New Guinea, Fiji Islands, Biak, Funafuti, and Tarawa. Between flights across the South Pacific, he was a test pilot and delivered planes to the East Coast.
In August of 1945, Bill Beeman married Nancy Jane Chandler from Vacaville, and within a few months he was drafted. He served in Korea with the Army Air Office in Seoul, and was honorably discharged in 1947.
Continuing his flying career, he then worked as an instructor with the Vacaville Dixon Flying Service until he moved to Pacific Overseas Airways in Los Angeles and then Peruvian International Airlines in Lima, Peru. When his flying career ended, Bill had completed over 6,000 hours of flying time.
After he was seriously burned in a fuel explosion and experienced significant legal problems as a result, Bill decided to enter the legal profession. In 1949, he started night school at the McGeorge College of Law in Sacramento. During this time, he worked as a bridge tender and telegraph switch operator for the Southern Pacific Railroad. In the last 15 months of law school, he worked as a U.S. Deputy Clerk for the Federal Court. He graduated with distinction from law school as second in his class, and started his own practice in Vallejo in January of 1954.
During his 50 plus years in the practice of law, Attorney Beeman pursued each of his cases with a fiercely competitive spirit, applying his keen intellect, his gift of storytelling, and his loyalty to the rule of law. In short, he hated to lose. In his trial work, no one ever accused Bill Beeman of a lack of effort. Throughout his law practice, he was genuinely interested in his clients, treating each with respect and sincere friendship.
Bill was devoted to Vallejo and Solano County. He led the efforts to establish the Solano County Legal Aid and Mental Health Programs. He was a lifetime member of the NAACP and served as president of the Solano County Bar Association. He enriched many childrens’ lives as a swimming instructor for the YMCA. Bill was also an energetic supporter of the Democratic Party, being involved in the local Democratic Club and in many local campaigns of state and national candidates.
In 1969, he married Eileen Posedel of Vallejo. He enjoyed golf, fishing, and waterskiing. Throughout his whole life, Bill was busy with his law practice, or community work, or political involvement, or writing, or family É all at the same time.
Bill Beeman is survived by his children, Paul L. Beeman (Donna Kenney), Rockne C. Beeman, Kimberly S. Vaughn (Bill), William L. Beeman II, and Frederick P. Beeman; his grandchildren, Lauren, William, Andrew, Ryan and Sarah; and great-grandchild, Kylie.
Services will be held on Saturday, February 21, at 11 a.m. at First United Methodist Church, 502 Virginia Street, Vallejo.

Bernice Velma Hanson was born on May 28, 1905, in Vallejo, Solano County, California. She was the daughter of Arthur Ferdinand Hanson (1876-1963) and Louise Dorothea Medau Hanson (1875-1954).
On June 8, 1931, Bernice married Ethan Warren Allen (1903-1971) in Solano County, California. Ethan was a decorated U.S. Navy aviator and trainer who graduated from the Naval Academy in 1927 and served from the 1930s through World War II. He flew various aircraft including Curtis Seagulls, Martin T4M Torpedo bombers, and Grumman Hellcats, and served as a Commanding Officer at the Corpus Christi Naval Air Station in 1941. He completed his Navy career in 1947 at San Francisco's Treasure Island Naval Base, retiring as a Lieutenant Commander.
Bernice and Ethan had at least two sons: Arthur Leigh Allen (1933-1992) and Ronald Allen. The family resided at 32 Fresno Street in Vallejo, California.
Ethan Warren Allen died on March 17, 1971, in Oakland, Alameda County, California, at the age of 67. Bernice outlived her husband by nearly 18 years, passing away on January 10, 1989, in Sonoma County, California, at the age of 83. Both Bernice and Ethan are interred at Sunrise Memorial Cemetery in Vallejo, in the Palm Court Mausoleum.
Connection to the Zodiac Killer Case
Bernice Allen's connection to the Zodiac Killer case stems from her son, Arthur Leigh Allen, who became the primary suspect investigated by law enforcement. Arthur Leigh Allen remains the only person publicly named by police as a suspect in the Zodiac Killer case. The Zodiac Killer was a serial killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area between December 1968 and October 1969, claiming responsibility for multiple murders and sending cryptic letters to the media.
Arthur Leigh Allen lived with his parents at the family home on 32 Fresno Street in Vallejo during the period when the Zodiac murders occurred. According to his brother Ronald Allen, their mother gave Arthur a Zodiac-brand watch as a Christmas gift in 1967, which became a notable detail in the investigation given the killer's self-chosen moniker.
Following Bernice Allen's death in October 1989, Arthur continued to live alone at the Fresno Street residence. In February 1991, approximately two years after his mother's death, the Vallejo Police Department executed a search warrant at the residence. Arthur Leigh Allen died on August 26, 1992, before any formal charges were filed. Despite extensive investigation, DNA and fingerprint evidence ultimately did not conclusively link him to the crimes.",,Arthur Leigh Allen newspaper coverage (1958-1990s),Death of Arthur Leigh Allen's father,3/17/1971,"""32 Fresno Street, Vallejo (Allen family home)"",Sunrise Memorial Cemetery",Sunrise Memorial Cemetery,"""32 Fresno Street, Vallejo (Allen family home)"",""Vallejo, CA"",""Solano County, CA"",California,SF Bay Area,United States of America,Sunrise Memorial Cemetery",,,,,https://www.google.com/search?as_q=Bernice%20Velma%20Hanson%20Allen&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&as_filetype=&tbs=,https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&as_q=Bernice%20Velma%20Hanson%20Allen&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgar=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&as_filetype=&tbs=&udm=2,,"Arthur Leigh Allen,Ronald Gene Allen,Ethan Warren Allen,Karen Marie (Long) Allen","Arthur Leigh Allen,Ronald Gene Allen,Ethan Warren Allen,Karen Marie (Long) Allen",,"Mother of Arthur Leigh Allen, wife of Ethan Warren Allen",,3,10/26/2025 2:35pm,9/14/2025 4:23pm,,recPDmge198CzhGuq

It is the only four-year college in Napa County, and the twelfth oldest institution of higher education in California.[5] As a coeducational residential college with an almost exclusively undergraduate student body, most of those who attend the college are four-year students living on campus.
PUC is accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission and maintains various programmatic accreditation for specific programs. Enrollment at Pacific Union College is roughly 825.[6] The college offers about 60 undergraduate majors and three master's programs organized in 25 academic departments, with its health science degrees the largest number of those sought out by students.[7][6] The campus occupies 200 acres (0.81 km2) of the college's 1,800 acres (7.3 km2) in property.[7]
History
Sidney Brownsberger, PUC's first presidentEarly years (1882–1908)
Pacific Union College was founded as Healdsburg Academy in Healdsburg, California, in northern Sonoma County, in 1882.[5][8] The creation of schools in the state was urged by Ellen G. White and other church leaders in an effort to accommodate the Adventist Church's growing membership on the West Coast and to train young Adventists for its work. The academy officially opened on April 11 of that year. It was the twelfth institution of higher education founded in California, and is the second founded by the Adventist Church, the first west of the Mississippi River.
Sidney Brownsberger served as its first President. Under his term, the academy focused on both conventional study of standard subjects as well as practical skills, such as dressmaking, blacksmithing, carpentry, and cooking, in line with White's desire for the college.[5][9][10] The lengthy tenure of William C. Grainger saw the heyday of the Academy's early years, but with the turn of the century, poor financial management led to increasing debt that eventually forced the academy to close in July 1908.[5][11]
Move to Angwin (1909–1921)
An early image of Pacific Union College's new campus in Angwin
Despite this failure, many church leaders – including White herself – continued to push for expanded Adventist schooling, and efforts were begun in the 1900s to find a new location to rebuild the college. Many sites were scouted out in the Central Valley and elsewhere within the state, but none came to the satisfaction of the searchers.[5]
Eventually, in 1909, the Pacific Union Conference announced that it had found an opening to purchase the 1,636 acres of the Angwin Resort on Howell Mountain in neighboring Napa County. The property had been found through the church's St. Helena Sanitarium, and White visited the site in September in 1909.[12][13] Satisfied with the condition of its facilities and living quarters and the ease with which they could be adapted for teaching purposes, its abundant resources in springs and lumber, and the healthful living its geography would provide, White approved the location.[9][13] The property was bought in the same month for $60,000 (roughly $1.9 million in 2022), and opened its doors September 29.[9][14] The name of the college was finalized as Pacific Union College in 1910 to reflect change in location, even as it had changed names a few times before.
PUC's first president at Angwin was Charles W. Irwin, who served from the opening of the new location until 1921. Irwin's term was marked by self-sufficiency as the college adapted to its new location, with both the faculty and student body working to expand the campus through the area's available natural resources.[5]
Early 20th century (1922–1943)
In the 1920s and 1930s, PUC expanded its educational programs with the goal of receiving educational accreditation. Driven by suggestions from the college's board, PUC required that professors have postgraduate degrees to teach, created lower and upper divisions, introduced major and minor degrees, and necessitated the completion of senior theses for graduation. The college also extended funds to pay for faculty members' graduate studies.[5] With these changes, PUC became the first Adventist college to become accredited when it was awarded accreditation by the Northwest Association of Secondary and Higher Schools in 1933.[15]
This era also saw further expansion of the campus community through the construction of more facilities – including new men's dormitories and its current gymnasium – as well as through the creation of the college's first student association, the Associated Students of Pacific Union College (ASPUC), in January 1935. The college's student newspaper, the Campus Chronicle, published its first issue in 1925 after being adapted from the previous Mountain Echo, while the Diogenes Lantern, PUC's current yearbook, was first published in 1938.[5]
With the United States' entry into World War II, over 400 male students and alumni were eventually drafted into military service.[5]
Other history (1943–2023)
In 2006 the faculty, administration, and Board of Trustees underscored PUC's commitment to undergraduate education by making a formal decision to remain a college and not change its name to university, as other small private colleges had done.[16]
In 2006, PUC's Board of Trustees made plans to transform the area into an ecovillage of several hundred settlements, in partnership with Triad Development, a Seattle-based construction firm.[17] Although the college downscaled its original plans due to community opposition – primarily by Save Rural Angwin, a local NIMBY group – the board voted in October 2010 to sever its contract with Triad and cancel the project.[18][19][20]
Pacific Union College has had a total of twenty-four presidents. The first eight of these served while the school was still in Healdsburg. In 1983, Malcolm Maxwell became the first alumnus to lead PUC, serving for a record 18 years. Ralph Trecartin, the current president, took office in July 2021 after serving as the associate provost and dean of the College of Professionals for Andrews University.[21]

Academics
Pacific Union College is the only four-year college located in Napa County, California.[22] It offers around 60 undergraduate majors in various fields, along with other types of programs. Health science, business, and education are the leading fields in which students seek out degrees, and their degree programs are accredited by their respective accreditation bodies.[6]
Curriculum
Pacific Union College offers 44 bachelor's degree programs, 10 associate degree programs, and three master's degree programs, in addition to minors, credential programs, pre-professional tracks, and an honors program.[23] These are all organized throughout 25 academic departments.[7] The school operates on a quarter-based academic calendar.[24]
Though the range of its offerings is quite broad, PUC's most prominent programs are those in the health sciences, which are sought out by a considerable number of those who attend. In the 2020–2021 school year, two-thirds of all undergraduate degrees awarded were in the medical field, and 96% of the associate's degrees awarded were for nursing.[6]
PUC maintains an especially close connection to Loma Linda University School of Medicine, another Adventist institution, and most of the college's pre-professional programs are meant specifically for admission into Loma Linda.[7] The college has sent a steady stream of students to the university for several decades; visiting from Loma Linda in 1925, John H. Kellogg noted that PUC was ""the college that sends the largest number of medical students from any one place.""[25] Degrees in business and education follow behind as the second two most sought-after.[6]
Similar to its emphasis on manual labor and physical health in its Healdsburg days, PUC necessitates that students takes fitness classes as part of its general education requirements.[7] Offerings in the past have included fencing, trikke, pickleball, swimming, water aerobics, polo, canoeing, skiing, snowboarding, soccer, dance, and yoga, though some of these have since been discontinued.[26]
Similar to other Adventist schools, PUC offers study-abroad programs through Adventist Colleges Abroad (ACA), primarily in Europe and Latin America.[27][28] Most of these programs were designed for those seeking degrees from the college's World Languages Department, though non-language majors often study abroad through the ACA as well.[29][30] PUC also organizes mission trips independently of ACA.[31][32][33]
Rankings
At the start of the 2023–2024, the U.S. News & World Report ranked Pacific Union College the 13th best regional college in the Western United States, the 12th top performer in social mobility (a position in shares with the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising), and the second Best Value School.[24] In the same year, the New York Times ranked PUC the 8th most economically diverse college in the U.S. Niche gives the college an overall B− score, and ranks it the 24th most diverse college in California, with its diversity graded A+. It also ranks PUC as the 14th best nursing college in California.[34]
In 2024, Washington Monthly ranked Pacific Union College 35th among 223 colleges that award almost exclusively bachelor's degrees in the U.S. based on its contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service. [35]
Accreditation
Pacific Union College has been accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission or its predecessor since 1951.[36] In February 2020, however, the commission issued a formal Notice of Concern regarding the college's accreditation, citing PUC's dwindling financial resources and dramatic drops in enrollment as areas that needed improvement.[37] Though in the years following PUC noted moderate increases in enrollment and dismissed a number of its employees in response to WSCUC's recommendations, the commission has not withdrawn its Notice of Concern.[38][39][40] PUC is also accredited by the Adventist Church's own Adventist Accrediting Association.[41][a]
In addition to these two institution-wide accreditations, many of PUC's programs and departments are accredited or approved by their respective programmatic accreditation bodies, including:
- National Association of Schools of Art and Design[42]
- National Association of Schools of Music[43]
- California Commission on Teacher Credentialing[44][b]
- International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education[45]
- Council on Social Work Education[46]
- Accrediting Commission for Education in Nursing[47]
Campus and facilities
The college is located in Angwin, on Howell Mountain overlooking the Napa Valley, 70 miles (110 km) north of San Francisco and 60 miles (85 km) from the Pacific Ocean. The main campus comprises about only 200 acres (0.81 km2) of the college's 1,800 acres (7.3 km2) in property.[7] The remaining 1,600 acres (6.5 km2) is managed as a conservation easement.[48]
Since 2007, Bon Appétite has catered the PUC Dining Commons. It serves exclusively vegetarian and vegan menu items sourced from local producers, in accordance with Adventist health beliefs and the company's own catering methods.[7][49] During winter 2011, the Commons saw heavy renovations which redesigned the cafeteria's architectural style and expanded its space.[50] In 2021, supply chain shortages caused by COVID-19 disrupted the kitchen's ability to source local ingredients.[51]
The college's main library is the Nelson Memorial Library, with holdings of around 150,000 books.[7] It also houses the Pitcairn Islands Study Center, with a collection of materials about the Pitcairn Islands, as well as literary collections for various figures in Adventist history. In 2011, the library was renovated at a cost of over a million dollars.[52]

Though the station was designed for educational purposes, and PUC's biology department makes use of the river's tide pools and estuaries for course learning, its cabins and other facilities have made it a center of broader student life, and sees visits from other departments.[53][54][55][56]

Angwin–Parrett Field
Main article: Angwin-Parrett Field
Pacific Union College owns and operates Angwin–Parrett Field, a public use airport located on its campus.[57] The airport was the landing spot during George W. Bush's presidential visit to the Napa Valley in 2006.[58] The airport also supports PUC's Bachelor of Science degree in aviation and offers ground schools and flight instruction to the community.[59]
PUC Forest
Much of the school's undeveloped acreage is managed as the PUC Demonstration & Experimental Forest, though on campus it has sometimes been called the Back 40.[48] The forest was part of the Angwin property and a site of lumber before it was bought by the college. It spans roughly 1,600 acres (6.5 km2). In addition to providing the resources necessary for the expansion of the campus in its early years, the forest has also served as a site for biological research and preservation, enclosing as it does unique species and biodiversity.[48][60]
In 2018, PUC partnered with the Napa County Land Trust to preserve the forest as a conservation easement; the easement is currently held by CalFire.[48][60] Covering 864 acres (3.50 km2), the easement protects about half of college's total property. It was valued at $7.1 million, much of it due to vineyard potential.[60] Attempts in the past have been made to develop or sell the land, however; most notably, the college made plans to transform the area into an ecovillage in 2006, but it ultimately chose to cancel the project.[19]
Still, with a network of hiking trails spanning 35 miles, the forest sees regular use. In 2019, the college partnered with Napa County's Open Space District to open its trail network to the public.[61][62] The forest is also a section along the Bay Area Ridge Trail, and was linked in the same year.[63][64] The 2009 Tour of California, an cycling race held within the state, raced through PUC.[65]

Pacific Union College Church
Main article: Pacific Union College Church
Pacific Union College Church is the campus church, built in 1968.[66] It has around 1,600 members.[67] The church's large pipe organ was built by Austrian organ-maker Rieger Orgelbau and installed in 1981.[68][69] The church complex also has classrooms for theology classes and houses PUC's Office of Service, Justice, and Missions.
Student life
Pacific Union College's stated focus is on undergraduate education.[16] In the fall of 2021, 829 students were enrolled at PUC, 825 of whom were undergraduate students.[6] The school maintains a student/teacher ratio of roughly 12:1.[8] As a residential college, the vast majority of these students live in one of seven on-campus residence halls.
Demographics
Within PUC's student body, the three largest ethnic demographics are Hispanic (31% in fall 2021), Asian (23%), and White (21%), while the remaining quarter includes Black students and others. Female students make up a majority of those on campus (63%), while male students comprise about a third (37%). A large majority of students are from California (78%), with only a fraction enrolling from out of state.[6] PUC was ranked as the most diverse liberal arts college in the Western United States by the U.S. News & World Report for the 2022–2023 school year.[70]
PUC also maintains a DEI Council as well as a Title IX Office.[71] It accepts the WSCUC criteria for diversity: race, ethnicity, socioeconomic class, gender, age, religious belief, sexual orientation and disability.[72]
Student association
The Pacific Union College Student Association (PUCSA) was started in 1887, just five years after the college was founded.[citation needed] It consists of an executive branch and a Student Senate. PUCSA funds publication of the school's student-run newspaper, the Campus Chronicle, and the college yearbook, the Diogenes Lantern.
Student organizations
There are more than 50 clubs, Honor's Associations and Student Ministries active on campus at Pacific Union College. These include the Secular Student Alliance, Biology Club, Asian Student Association, Pre-Med Club, Korean Adventist Student Association, Dramatic Arts Society, Musical Arts Symposium, Homeless Ministry, Psi Chi, College Democrats and others. In addition to the Campus Chronicle, there are several other student-run publications including a literary periodical, Quicksilver.

A gay-straight alliance, Gay and Straight People (GASP), has operated on campus since October 2008. It was first organized by a pre-med student named Jonathan Heldt, who established the alliance when he was a senior in the hopes of creating a support group for LGBTQ students and their allies.[73] Originally intending to form an official club, Heldt's proposal was rejected by PUC's Advisory Council.[74]
Students and faculty continue to meet regularly to discuss LGBTQ issues.[74][75] Though the club remains formally unrecognized by the college, the group contributed to the expansion of all-gender bathrooms on campus, and has had presence at the college's student orientation and club fairs.[76][73] In December 2022, the Student Senate passed a bill calling for GASP's recognition as an official club, though it has yet to be addressed by administration.[76][77]
Athletics
The Pacific Union athletic teams are called the Pioneers. The college is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the California Pacific Conference (CalPac) since the 1996–97 academic year.
Pacific Union competes in eight intercollegiate sports: Men's sports include basketball, cross country, soccer and volleyball; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, soccer and volleyball.
Accomplishments
PUC has been awarded the ""California Pacific Conference Team Sportsmanship Award"" five times since 2003, most recently for the 2010–2011 school year.[78] In fall 2011, the coaches for varsity women's volleyball and men's soccer described it as ""rebuilding"" time.[79] This award signifies the school that displays outstanding sportsmanship and exemplifies the true spirit of the ""Champions of Character"" program set forth by the NAIA.[80][81]
Intramurals
PUC maintains an active intramural athletic program under the name RecRadio.org.[82][83] The intramural athletic program is the top intramural athletics program in the country according to College Prowler's ""Best Intramural Sports"" ranking.[84]
Alumni
Main article: List of Pacific Union College alumni
Pacific Union College has been described as a ""training ground for an inordinately large number of outstanding physicians, dentists, nurses, teachers and theologians"" who make up its 50,000 alumni.[85] A large majority of students who graduate from the college do so with degrees in the health sciences.[6] Most of PUC's notable alumni include individuals in academic administration or political offices, though some have been recognized in other fields.[85]",,,Cecilia Shepard is buried in St. Helena,10/2/1969,"""Angwin, CA""","""St. Helena, CA"",""Angwin, CA""","""Napa County, CA"",SF Bay Area,""Angwin, CA"",California,United States of America","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College,",,"Cecelia Ann Shepard,Dean at Pacific Union College,Joanne (Sunbather),Linda (Sunbather),Linda L.

Virginia Lee Jensen, local artist and teacher, passed away peacefully Friday afternoon after a brief illness.
With a BA in art/history, Virginia”s passion for art and education carried her through life, serving as a substitute teacher for the Oakland and Vallejo school districts.
She was an avid artist who loved to travel to the Monterey Coast where many of her beautiful seascapes were created.
Originally from Council Bluffs, Iowa, Virginia Lee Blenderman was preceded in death by her parents, Louis and Avis Blenderman; husband, Lt. Col. Verne M. Jensen; and daughter, Betty Lou Jensen. She is survived by her daughter, Melodie L. (Joe T.) Long and granddaughter, Denise (Gary) Shiner, and four great-grandchildren. She will be dearly missed.
The family is very grateful to his caregivers at Angels Crest Home for their wonderful compassionate care and the Sutter Solano Hospice Nurses.
Graveside services will be held Thursday at 2 p.m. at Skyview Memorial Lawn Cemetery.
In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Humane Society.

Donald C. B. Marsh,"Other,Researcher",,,,"Prof. Marsh and the Zodiac Killer
By Donn Kraemer and Bill Harris
The Oredigger – Colorado School of Mines, Vol. 50, No. 13 (Dec. 15, 1969) 

Somewhere in San Francisco an unknown killer possibly plans his next murder, while in Golden a CSM professor works to thwart and expose him.

Professor Donald C. B. Marsh of the Mines math department is currently working on the ciphers sent by the killer, “Zodiac.” In these messages Zodiac tells of his past murders and reportedly gives his name.

Marsh is currently president of the American Cryptogram Association and has been a member for almost twenty years. Since 1960 he has been the editor of the foreign cipher section of the association’s journal.

Will Stevens, a staff writer for the San Francisco Examiner, called Dr. Marsh into the Zodiac case last August. Stevens had received Marsh’s name from Farago, author of the book The Broken Seal, the story of the cracking of the Japanese codes before World War II.

In briefing Marsh on the killings that had occurred near Vallejo, California, on December 20, 1968, and July 4, 1969, Stevens disclosed that “an individual purporting to be the killer had sent letters accompanied by ciphers to three of the area’s newspapers.” Marsh agreed to help in solving the ciphers, and was able to extract the message from the copies of the code sent to him.

Zodiac apparently enjoys reading news of himself, as he sends to the news media coded messages in which he says lie the clues to his identity and future murders.

And Zodiac said, “W A → DRF?”

According to Marsh, some parts of the Zodiac’s messages betray the man as an amateur, while other parts show that the man has some sophisticated knowledge of cryptography. One point of note is the fact that he changes the key, which shows some knowledge of ciphers. However, an educated cryptographer, in drafting a message, would probably use a numerical rather than a symbolic code (such as the one the Zodiac uses), thus giving the ciphers more flexibility in their encoding.

Marsh said, “In my opinion, some errors in the encipherment, as well as in the use of the various symbols rather than simple letters or numbers, indicate that the Zodiac… is not an experienced cryptographer. Each symbol represents a unique letter of the alphabet, but nearly every letter… was assigned more than one symbolic equivalent. These multiple substitutes and the omission of word spaces make the ciphers more difficult than the simple substitution ciphers found in many newspapers and puzzle magazines, but it would not require an expert to devise either of these complications.”

The ciphers consisted of various geometric symbols and alphabet letters, some reversed and inverted, printed in 8” × 17” rectangular arrays. According to Marsh, “the three portions incorporated the same symbols, indicating the likelihood that the same method of encipherment was used in each case.”

The three portions, when deciphered, seemed to make up a single rather wild message, in which the killer did not reveal his name as he had previously promised (“In this cipher is my identity.”).

Marsh also related fears by many people involved that the current Sharon Tate murder case will sting Zodiac’s ego, prompting him to commit more murders.

Anxiously meeting the challenge of decoding the messages, Dr. Marsh is currently working on the latest of Zodiac’s cryptograms. He has issued a challenge to the killer, saying that he can decipher the message despite the Zodiac’s efforts to outwit him. Until that time, though, the killer’s identity and future plans may possibly remain as much of an “unsolved puzzle” as they are now.",,,"Dr. D.C.B.
