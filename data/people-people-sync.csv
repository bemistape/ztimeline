His death was the last confirmed Zodiac killing.,,52,"{""isStale"": true, ""state"": ""generated"", ""value"": ""Based on my research, I can now provide a comprehensive biography of Paul Stine in the context of the Zodiac Killer case:\n\n# Paul Lee Stine (1939-1969)\n\nPaul Lee Stine was a 29-year-old San Francisco taxi driver who became the final confirmed victim of the Zodiac Killer on October 11, 1969. His murder marked a significant turning point in the Zodiac case, as it was the only confirmed Zodiac killing within San Francisco city limits and provided crucial evidence that would define the investigation for decades to come.\n\n## Early Life and Background\n\nPaul Lee Stine was born on December 18, 1939, in Exeter, California. He was the son of Theodore Milford \""Teddy\"" Stine (1904-1967) and Audra Thelma Busby Harrison (1912-1988), and stepson of Roy James Harrison (1895-1968). Paul had several siblings, including his brother Joe Charles Stine (1935-1981), sisters Geneva Ann Stine Marriott (1941-2006), Thelma Fletcher, and Carol Lou Irwin.\n\n## Education and Career\n\nAt the time of his death, Paul was pursuing a Ph.D. in English at San Francisco State College (now San Francisco State University). To support himself through his doctoral studies, he worked multiple jobs: he was a part-time insurance agent and drove a taxi for Yellow Cab Company during night shifts from 9 PM to 5 AM. Paul was described as a dedicated student who worked diligently toward his academic goals while maintaining employment to pay for his education.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nPaul was married to Claudia S. Stine (née Wescott). Standing 5 feet 9 inches tall, he was known for wearing glasses and was described as a bespectacled young man.\n\n## The Murder: October 11, 1969\n\nOn the evening of October 11, 1969, Paul was working his regular night shift as a taxi driver when he was hailed by a passenger in front of theaters near the intersection of Mason and Geary Streets in downtown San Francisco. The passenger requested to be taken to Washington and Maple Streets in the affluent Presidio Heights neighborhood. However, for reasons that remain unclear, Paul's taxi ended up one block away at the intersection of Washington and Cherry Streets.\n\nAt approximately 9:55 PM, the passenger—later identified as the Zodiac Killer—shot Paul at point-blank range in the back of the head with a 9mm semi-automatic pistol. This weapon was different from those used in previous Zodiac attacks. Three teenage witnesses across the street observed the killer in the front passenger seat of the taxi, searching Paul's pockets and wiping down the interior of the cab before fleeing on foot north on Cherry Street.\n\n## The Investigation and Evidence\n\nThe witnesses provided a detailed description of the suspect: a white male, 25-30 years old, 5'8\"" to 5'9\"" tall with a stocky build, reddish-brown hair in a crew cut, heavy-rimmed glasses, and dark clothing. Due to a dispatcher error that initially described the suspect as an African American male, two responding patrol officers, Donald Fouke and Eric Zelms, passed a white male walking east on Jackson Street but did not stop him. When the description was corrected, they realized they may have encountered the killer.\n\nOfficer Armand Pelissetti discovered bloody fingerprint impressions on the taxi door, which became crucial evidence in the case. The killer had also stolen a portion of Paul's shirt, which would later serve as proof of the crime.\n\n## The Zodiac Connection\n\nTwo days after the murder, on October 13, 1969, the San Francisco Chronicle received a letter from the Zodiac Killer claiming responsibility for Paul's death. The letter began with the now-infamous phrase \""This is the Zodiac speaking. I am the murderer of the taxi driver over by Washington & Maple St. last night. To prove this here is a blood stained piece of his shirt\"". The letter also contained the killer's most chilling threat: \""School children make nice targets I think I shall wipe out a school bus some morning just shoot out the frunt tire + pick off the kiddies as they come bouncing out\"".\n\n## Significance in the Zodiac Case\n\nPaul Stine's murder was significant for several reasons. It was the Zodiac's only confirmed killing within San Francisco proper, bringing the case to the attention of the San Francisco Police Department. The crime provided the clearest eyewitness descriptions of the killer and yielded physical evidence including fingerprints and the piece of shirt that the Zodiac used to authenticate his letters. The murder also marked the last confirmed Zodiac killing, making Paul Stine the final known victim of one of America's most notorious unidentified serial killers.\n\n## Legacy\n\nPaul Stine's death at age 29 cut short the life of a promising doctoral student who was working to better himself through education. His murder remains one of the most well-documented Zodiac crimes due to the eyewitness testimony and physical evidence collected at the scene. The case remains open and is still being investigated by the FBI San Francisco Office.

His murder marked a significant turning point in the Zodiac case, as it was the only confirmed Zodiac killing within San Francisco city limits and provided crucial evidence that would define the investigation for decades to come.
## Early Life and Background
Paul Lee Stine was born on December 18, 1939, in Exeter, California. He was the son of Theodore Milford ""Teddy"" Stine (1904-1967) and Audra Thelma Busby Harrison (1912-1988), and stepson of Roy James Harrison (1895-1968). Paul had several siblings, including his brother Joe Charles Stine (1935-1981), sisters Geneva Ann Stine Marriott (1941-2006), Thelma Fletcher, and Carol Lou Irwin.
## Education and Career
At the time of his death, Paul was pursuing a Ph.D. in English at San Francisco State College (now San Francisco State University). To support himself through his doctoral studies, he worked multiple jobs: he was a part-time insurance agent and drove a taxi for Yellow Cab Company during night shifts from 9 PM to 5 AM. Paul was described as a dedicated student who worked diligently toward his academic goals while maintaining employment to pay for his education.
## Personal Life
Paul was married to Claudia S. Stine (née Wescott). Standing 5 feet 9 inches tall, he was known for wearing glasses and was described as a bespectacled young man.
## The Murder: October 11, 1969
On the evening of October 11, 1969, Paul was working his regular night shift as a taxi driver when he was hailed by a passenger in front of theaters near the intersection of Mason and Geary Streets in downtown San Francisco. The passenger requested to be taken to Washington and Maple Streets in the affluent Presidio Heights neighborhood. However, for reasons that remain unclear, Paul's taxi ended up one block away at the intersection of Washington and Cherry Streets.
At approximately 9:55 PM, the passenger—later identified as the Zodiac Killer—shot Paul at point-blank range in the back of the head with a 9mm semi-automatic pistol. This weapon was different from those used in previous Zodiac attacks. Three teenage witnesses across the street observed the killer in the front passenger seat of the taxi, searching Paul's pockets and wiping down the interior of the cab before fleeing on foot north on Cherry Street.
## The Investigation and Evidence
The witnesses provided a detailed description of the suspect: a white male, 25-30 years old, 5'8"" to 5'9"" tall with a stocky build, reddish-brown hair in a crew cut, heavy-rimmed glasses, and dark clothing. Due to a dispatcher error that initially described the suspect as an African American male, two responding patrol officers, Donald Fouke and Eric Zelms, passed a white male walking east on Jackson Street but did not stop him. When the description was corrected, they realized they may have encountered the killer.
Officer Armand Pelissetti discovered bloody fingerprint impressions on the taxi door, which became crucial evidence in the case. The killer had also stolen a portion of Paul's shirt, which would later serve as proof of the crime.
## The Zodiac Connection
Two days after the murder, on October 13, 1969, the San Francisco Chronicle received a letter from the Zodiac Killer claiming responsibility for Paul's death. The letter began with the now-infamous phrase:
> ""This is the Zodiac speaking. I am the murderer of the taxi driver over by Washington & Maple St. last night. To prove this here is a blood stained piece of his shirt"". 
The letter also contained the killer's most chilling threat: 
> ""School children make nice targets I think I shall wipe out a school bus some morning just shoot out the frunt tire + pick off the kiddies as they come bouncing out"".
Paul Stine's murder  was the Zodiac's only confirmed killing within San Francisco proper, bringing the case to the attention of the San Francisco Police Department. The crime provided the clearest eyewitness descriptions of the killer and yielded physical evidence including fingerprints and the piece of shirt that the Zodiac used to authenticate his letters. The murder also marked the last confirmed Zodiac killing, making Paul Stine the final known victim of one of America's most notorious unidentified serial killers.
The intersection of Washington and Cherry Streets in Presidio Heights, where Paul died, remains largely unchanged from that October night in 1969, serving as a somber reminder of this pivotal moment in criminal history.

Born in Kiowa County, Colorado, she moved to Benicia and attended Hogan High School, where she was a popular student and a talented artist. Jensen was active in the Prima Vera Council #132 Pythian Sunshine Girls and attended the Christian Science Church ([www.shadowofthezodiac.com](https://www.shadowofthezodiac.com/victims/lake-herman-rd/#:~:text=17%20Gender%3A%20Male%20,a%20native%20of%20San%20Rafael)).

The murders shocked the Bay Area and were later claimed by the Zodiac Killer in his letters.

The family relocated to Vallejo, California, approximately 3½ years before his death, settling at 1939 Sereno Drive.\n\n## Education and Activities\n\nDavid was a student at Vallejo High School, where he demonstrated active involvement in school life. He was a member of the Interact Club and participated on the high school wrestling team.\n\n## Scouting Achievements\n\nDavid was exceptionally accomplished in the Boy Scouts of America, achieving the rank of Eagle Scout and serving as a member of Explorer Post 209. His leadership abilities were recognized through his position as lodge chief of the Order of the Arrow in Solano, Napa, and Lake counties. He earned the prestigious God and Country Award through his scouting activities and served on the staff of the Silverado Area Council camp. He was also a member of the Knights of Dunamis.\n\n## Religious Involvement\n\nDavid was an active member of First Presbyterian Church in Vallejo, reflecting his family's religious commitment.\n\n## The Lake Herman Road Murder\n\nOn December 20, 1968, David Faraday, age 17, left his home to pick up his date, 16-year-old Betty Lou Jensen, who lived at 123 Ridgewood Court in Vallejo. The two teenagers attended a Christmas concert at Hogan High School before driving to a remote lovers' lane on Lake Herman Road, east of Vallejo.\n\nAt approximately 11:15 p.m., a passing motorist named Helen Axe observed Faraday's 1961 brown and beige Rambler station wagon parked at the turnout with another vehicle present.

The son of a local pest‑control businessman, Mageau grew up in Vallejo and was living an unremarkable teenage life in the summer of 1969 ([thecinemaholic.com](https://thecinemaholic.com/michael-mageau/#:~:text=Friend%E2%80%99s%20Car%20Michael%20Renault%20Mageau%2C,a%20moment%20before%20driving%20away)). On the evening of July 4 1969 he met 22‑year‑old waitress Darlene Ferrin, a friend with whom he had been spending time; they drove to Blue Rock Springs Park, a popular lovers’ lane near Vallejo. A car pulled into the parking lot, left briefly and returned. Thinking it might be a police officer, Mageau and Ferrin searched for identification. Instead, the driver approached with a flashlight and opened fire with a 9‑mm handgun, striking both occupants multiple times ([thecinemaholic.com](https://thecinemaholic.com/michael-mageau/)). The attacker briefly walked away but, hearing Mageau’s groans, returned to shoot both victims again before fleeing. Ferrin died en route to hospital, while the 19‑year‑old Mageau survived despite four bullet wounds and severe injuries ([allthatsinteresting.com](https://allthatsinteresting.com/zodiac-killer-victims/2#:~:text=July%204%2C%201969%20%E2%80%94%C2%A0more%20than,around%205%E2%80%998%E2%80%B3%2C%20with%20a%20round)). Minutes later, an anonymous caller claiming to be the shooter telephoned Vallejo police to report the crime and to link it to the December 1968 Lake Herman Road murders.
Recovering from his wounds, Mageau provided investigators with a description of the assailant: a white man around 5 feet 8 inches tall with a stocky build, round face and brown hair ([allthatsinteresting.com](https://allthatsinteresting.com/zodiac-killer-victims/2)). In 1991 he tentatively identified photo line‑ups of Arthur Leigh Allen as resembling the shooter, though he admitted his memory was limited and police never substantiated the identification ([thecinemaholic.com](https://thecinemaholic.com/michael-mageau/#:~:text=out%20of%20the%20public%20eye%2C,arrest%20based%20solely%20on%20his)). Mageau avoided publicity for decades, struggling with the trauma of the attack; he made occasional appearances in documentaries and true‑crime programs and served as a consultant for David Fincher’s 2007 film _Zodiac_ ([thecinemaholic.com](https://thecinemaholic.com/michael-mageau/#:~:text=out%20of%20the%20public%20eye%2C,much%20is%20known%20about%20his)). His current whereabouts remain private, and he has not publicly endorsed any particular suspect theory. Mageau’s account remains one of the few first‑hand descriptions of the Zodiac killer and continues to inform both official investigations and independent research.

While driving north to visit family, her car pulled over near Modesto, California when a stranger warned her that a wheel was loose. After he tinkered with the wheel it came off as she resumed driving. The man then offered her and her ten‑month‑old daughter a ride. Instead of taking them to a garage he drove around rural roads for two hours, making threats that he would kill them and throw the baby out of the vehicle ([www.aetv.com](https://www.aetv.com/articles/zodiac-killer#:~:text=March%201970%2C%20Kathleen%20Johns%2C%20who,letters%20and%20crimes%20have%20been), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_kidnappings%3A_1970%E2%80%931979#:~:text=22%20March%201970Kathleen%20Johns%20,1)). Johns eventually leapt from the moving car with her child, hid in a field and later reached the Patterson police. She later recognized a composite sketch of the Zodiac and a July 1970 letter from the self‑styled serial killer claimed credit for abducting “a woman + her baby,” but law‑enforcement never conclusively linked the abduction to the Zodiac murders ([www.aetv.com](https://www.aetv.com/articles/zodiac-killer#:~:text=March%201970%2C%20Kathleen%20Johns%2C%20who,letters%20and%20crimes%20have%20been), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_kidnappings%3A_1970%E2%80%931979#:~:text=22%20March%201970Kathleen%20Johns%20,1)). Johns survived the ordeal and lived largely out of the public eye; she is still regarded as a significant witness because her description of the driver contributed to composite sketches of the suspect.

It traces its roots to January 16, 1865, when teenage brothers Charles and M. H. de Young founded the paper as the Daily Dramatic Chronicle. It adopted its current name in 1869 and, as San Francisco grew, the Chronicle became one of the largest newspapers on the West Coast by the 1880s ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle#:~:text=The%20San%20Francisco%20Chronicle%20is,the%20%2085%20by%201880)). Now owned by Hearst Communications, the broadsheet remains the dominant daily newspaper in San Francisco.
The Chronicle is inextricably linked to the Zodiac case because the killer used the newspaper as his main conduit to the public. On July 31 1969, a letter arrived at the Chronicle in which a person claimed responsibility for the Lake Herman Road and Blue Rock Springs murders and enclosed a portion of a cipher; the other two parts were mailed to the Vallejo Times‑Herald and the San Francisco Examiner. Over the next several years the killer sent a string of taunting letters, cards and cryptograms to newspapers — 17 of the 22 known communications were delivered to the Chronicle ([www.sfchronicle.com](https://www.sfchronicle.com/nation/article/zodiac-killer-case-how-the-san-francisco-13464935.php#:~:text=Zodiac%20Letter%20The%20Chronicle%20One,Zodiac%20Killer)). Among them were a letter containing part of taxi driver Paul Stine’s shirt, and a Halloween card that threatened Chronicle reporter Paul Avery. The Chronicle published many of these communications and played a central role in reporting on the case, but there is no evidence that anyone at the paper had any connection to the crimes; its involvement was as a journalistic intermediary between the killer and the public.

She was the younger of two children; her older brother Michael served in the United States Navy. In 1957, the Bates family relocated to California, where her father found employment as a machinist at the Corona Naval Ordnance Laboratory. The family settled in Riverside, California, where Cheri would spend her formative years.\n\nCheri was a graduate of Ramona High School in Riverside, where she distinguished herself as a varsity cheerleader, active participant in student government, and honor student. Described by acquaintances as a \""sweet, outgoing girl,\"" she aspired to become a flight attendant. Following her high school graduation, Bates enrolled at Riverside City College (RCC) and found part-time employment at the Riverside National Bank. Her savings and wages from this employment helped her purchase a 1960 lime green Volkswagen Beetle, a vehicle she was proud to own. Her parents divorced in 1965, and she lived with her father at 4195 Via San Jose in Riverside.\n\n**The Murder:**\n\nOn October 30, 1966, the 18-year-old college freshman was murdered on the grounds of Riverside City College. That morning, Bates and her father attended Sunday Mass at St. Catherine of Alexandria Catholic Church before sharing breakfast at a local restaurant. In the early afternoon, she decided to visit the college library to study and work on a research paper. She left a note for her father on the family refrigerator reading: \""Dad—Went to RCC Library\"". She is believed to have departed for the library between 4:30 and 5:00 p.m.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, Bates studied in the library until its normal closing time of 9:00 p.m. When she returned to her vehicle, police determined that an assailant had disabled the ignition wiring and distributor of her Volkswagen Beetle as a method to lure her from her car. Her body was discovered at approximately 6:28 a.m. on October 31, 1966, by a groundskeeper named Cleophus Martin. She was found on a gravel path between two unoccupied houses on Terracina Drive, close to the library parking lot.\n\nThe autopsy revealed that Bates had been repeatedly stabbed in the chest and left shoulder, and suffered several deep slash wounds to her face and neck that severed her jugular vein and larynx, nearly decapitating her. She had also been repeatedly kicked in the head. Evidence at the crime scene indicated a ferocious physical struggle; Bates had scratched her assailant's arms, face, and head, and torn off his wristwatch. Fragments of skin and brown hair were recovered from beneath her fingernails. She had not been subjected to sexual assault or robbery. Investigators determined she was most likely murdered at approximately 10:15 p.m.\n\nOn November 4, 1966, Bates was laid to rest at Crestlawn Memorial Park in Riverside, with her parents, older brother, and several hundred mourners in attendance.\n\n**Related Events:**\n\n**The Confession Letters (November 29, 1966):** One month after Bates's murder, two identical typewritten letters arrived at Riverside Police Department headquarters and the editorial offices of the Riverside Press-Enterprise. The author described in detail how he had disabled Bates's car and lured her away before attacking her. The letters included details of the murder that had not been released to the press, leading investigators to initially believe the author may have been the actual murderer.\n\n**The Desktop Poem (Discovered 1967):** Six months after the murder, a custodian discovered a macabre poem scratched into the underside of a foldable desk in the RCC library. Titled \""Sick of living/unwilling to die,\"" the poem contained graphic references to repeated assaults upon young women with a bladed weapon. The poem's language and handwriting resembled that of later Zodiac Killer letters, and it was signed with what appeared to be lowercase initials (r h).\n\n**\""Bates Had to Die\"" Letters (April 30, 1967):** On April 30, 1967, the Riverside Police Department, the Press-Enterprise, and Bates's father received handwritten letters from an unknown individual with the message \""Bates had to die. There will be more\"". At the bottom of each letter was an indecipherable number or letter that was either a \""2\"" or a \""Z\"". In August 2021, the Riverside Police Department announced that the author of these letters had been identified via DNA analysis in 2020 and had admitted to writing the correspondence as a distasteful hoax when he was a troubled teenager.\n\n**Connection to the Zodiac Killer:**\n\nBates has been hypothesized by some investigators to have been an early victim—perhaps even the first—of the unidentified serial killer known as the Zodiac Killer, who was active in Northern California from the late 1960s to the early 1970s. In November 1970, San Francisco Chronicle journalist Paul Avery received an anonymous letter informing him of similarities between the Zodiac murders and Bates's murder. Handwriting expert Sherwood Morrill stated that the handwriting on the RCC desk and the 1967 letters were \""unquestionably\"" written by the same individual who had written the Zodiac letters.\n\nIn a letter dated March 13, 1971, the Zodiac claimed responsibility for Bates's murder to the Los Angeles Times, stating: \""I do have to give [the police] credit for stumbling across my Riverside activity, but they are only finding the easy ones\"". However, the Riverside Police Department has consistently maintained that there is no evidence linking Bates's killing to the later Zodiac murders and strongly believes her murderer was native to Riverside County.\n\n**Current Status:**\n\nThe murder of Cheri Jo Bates remains officially unsolved and is one of Riverside's most infamous cold cases. A 2016 Press-Enterprise article reported that the Riverside Police Department strongly believes they know the identity of Bates's murderer but have never been able to obtain sufficient evidence to arrest and charge this individual. DNA profiling determined that her murderer was a Caucasian male.\n\n**Legacy:**\n\nFollowing the murder, Bates's family established The Cheri Jo Bates Memorial Endowed Scholarship at Riverside City College, awarded to students active in school projects who demonstrate financial need, undertake volunteer work, and major in music with at least a B grade average.""}",2025-11-10T03:15:14.000Z,2025-09-05T22:16:41.000Z,"{""isStale"": true, ""state"": ""generated"", ""value"": ""Based on my research, here is a comprehensive biography of Cheri Jo Bates:\n\n---\n\n**CHERI JO BATES**\n\n**Biographical Information:**\n\nCheri Josephine Bates was born on February 4, 1948, in Omaha, Nebraska, to Joseph and Irene (née Karolevitz) Bates.

She was found on a gravel path between two unoccupied houses on Terracina Drive, close to the library parking lot.\n\nThe autopsy revealed that Bates had been repeatedly stabbed in the chest and left shoulder, and suffered several deep slash wounds to her face and neck that severed her jugular vein and larynx, nearly decapitating her. She had also been repeatedly kicked in the head. Evidence at the crime scene indicated a ferocious physical struggle; Bates had scratched her assailant's arms, face, and head, and torn off his wristwatch. Fragments of skin and brown hair were recovered from beneath her fingernails. She had not been subjected to sexual assault or robbery. Investigators determined she was most likely murdered at approximately 10:15 p.m.\n\nOn November 4, 1966, Bates was laid to rest at Crestlawn Memorial Park in Riverside, with her parents, older brother, and several hundred mourners in attendance.\n\n**Related Events:**\n\n**The Confession Letters (November 29, 1966):** One month after Bates's murder, two identical typewritten letters arrived at Riverside Police Department headquarters and the editorial offices of the Riverside Press-Enterprise. The author described in detail how he had disabled Bates's car and lured her away before attacking her. The letters included details of the murder that had not been released to the press, leading investigators to initially believe the author may have been the actual murderer.\n\n**The Desktop Poem (Discovered 1967):** Six months after the murder, a custodian discovered a macabre poem scratched into the underside of a foldable desk in the RCC library. Titled \""Sick of living/unwilling to die,\"" the poem contained graphic references to repeated assaults upon young women with a bladed weapon. The poem's language and handwriting resembled that of later Zodiac Killer letters, and it was signed with what appeared to be lowercase initials (r h).\n\n**\""Bates Had to Die\"" Letters (April 30, 1967):** On April 30, 1967, the Riverside Police Department, the Press-Enterprise, and Bates's father received handwritten letters from an unknown individual with the message \""Bates had to die. There will be more\"". At the bottom of each letter was an indecipherable number or letter that was either a \""2\"" or a \""Z\"". In August 2021, the Riverside Police Department announced that the author of these letters had been identified via DNA analysis in 2020 and had admitted to writing the correspondence as a distasteful hoax when he was a troubled teenager.\n\n**Connection to the Zodiac Killer:**\n\nBates has been hypothesized by some investigators to have been an early victim—perhaps even the first—of the unidentified serial killer known as the Zodiac Killer, who was active in Northern California from the late 1960s to the early 1970s. In November 1970, San Francisco Chronicle journalist Paul Avery received an anonymous letter informing him of similarities between the Zodiac murders and Bates's murder. Handwriting expert Sherwood Morrill stated that the handwriting on the RCC desk and the 1967 letters were \""unquestionably\"" written by the same individual who had written the Zodiac letters.\n\nIn a letter dated March 13, 1971, the Zodiac claimed responsibility for Bates's murder to the Los Angeles Times, stating: \""I do have to give [the police] credit for stumbling across my Riverside activity, but they are only finding the easy ones\"". However, the Riverside Police Department has consistently maintained that there is no evidence linking Bates's killing to the later Zodiac murders and strongly believes her murderer was native to Riverside County.\n\n**Current Status:**\n\nThe murder of Cheri Jo Bates remains officially unsolved and is one of Riverside's most infamous cold cases. A 2016 Press-Enterprise article reported that the Riverside Police Department strongly believes they know the identity of Bates's murderer but have never been able to obtain sufficient evidence to arrest and charge this individual. DNA profiling determined that her murderer was a Caucasian male.\n\n**Legacy:**\n\nFollowing the murder, Bates's family established The Cheri Jo Bates Memorial Endowed Scholarship at Riverside City College, awarded to students active in school projects who demonstrate financial need, undertake volunteer work, and major in music with at least a B grade average.""}","recrwMyU669yUfeBS,recioUzi4gjitPDzS,recO5mW1mFKtK0hCE","{""label"": ""Sq.

Born in Omaha, Nebraska, she grew up in Riverside, California, where she excelled at Ramona High School as a cheerleader, student government participant and honor student ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Cheri_Jo_Bates#:~:text=Josephine%20Bates%20was%20born%20in,lived%20with%20her%20father%20at), [heathermonroe.medium.com](https://heathermonroe.medium.com/the-unsolved-murder-of-cheri-jo-bates-bc1af7e1715a#:~:text=fall,%E2%80%9D%20She%20had%20no)). After graduation she studied at Riverside City College and worked part-time at Riverside National Bank, using her earnings to buy a 1960 Volkswagen Beetle ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Cheri_Jo_Bates#:~:text=Josephine%20Bates%20was%20born%20in,lived%20with%20her%20father%20at)).

On October 30 1966 Bates told her father she was going to the Riverside City College library to study. Investigators later concluded that someone disabled the ignition and distributor of her Volkswagen, luring her away from her car. Early on the morning of October 31 her body was found in an alley near the library; she had been stabbed multiple times and her throat had been slashed, but she had not been robbed or sexually assaulted ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Cheri_Jo_Bates#:~:text=The%20murder%20of%20Cheri%20Jo,brought%20attention%20to%20the%20cold), [www.zodiackiller.com](https://www.zodiackiller.com/Bates.html#:~:text=%28Mon.%29%20Case%20number%3A%20352,from%20the%20attacker%27s%20wrist%20during)). Months later anonymous letters and a poem claimed responsibility for the murder, and in 1971 an individual signing himself “the Zodiac” also claimed it. Some researchers have speculated that the crime was the Zodiac killer’s first attack, but the Riverside Police Department has maintained that there is no evidence linking the murder to the Zodiac and believes the perpetrator was a local person ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Cheri_Jo_Bates#:~:text=The%20murder%20of%20Cheri%20Jo,brought%20attention%20to%20the%20cold)).

_Bay Area broadcaster and longtime KGO Radio/KGO‑TV host whose live morning program became the stage for the high‑profile October 22, 1969 “Sam” call from a man claiming to be the Zodiac; the caller was later identified as a mental patient, not the Zodiac._

Biography:
\- Jim Dunbar was an American radio program director, talk show host, and news anchor best known for transforming KGO Radio into a Bay Area ratings leader and for hosting AM San Francisco on KGO‑TV starting in the mid‑1960s.
\- Born in Dearborn, Michigan, he worked early in his career in Detroit (WXYZ), New Orleans (WDSU, also as station manager), and Chicago (WLS) before joining KGO in 1963, where he spent 37 years and became a central media figure in San Francisco.
\- On October 22, 1969, amid intense public interest in the Zodiac case, Oakland Police received a predawn call from a man claiming to be Zodiac who demanded that attorney F. Lee Bailey or Melvin Belli appear on Dunbar’s KGO‑TV show; Belli appeared, and during the live broadcast a caller identifying himself as “Sam” phoned repeatedly to speak with them.
\- Police and investigators later determined the caller was Eric Weill (often misspelled “Weil”), a mental patient calling from a state hospital, and ruled him out as the Zodiac; Dunbar’s broadcast nevertheless became one of the case’s most widely remembered media moments.
\- Dunbar continued a prominent Bay Area career; in 1973 he survived an on‑air shooting attempt at KGO when a gunman fired at him through studio glass, an incident that became part of his public profile.
\- Honors include induction into the National Radio Hall of Fame (1999) and the inaugural class of the Bay Area Radio Hall of Fame (2006).
\- In popular culture, Dunbar was portrayed by Tom Verica in David Fincher’s 2007 film “Zodiac,” which recreates the KGO‑TV call sequence.

Maupin’s role in surfacing the letter controversy linked him directly to one of the case’s most scrutinized episodes, documented at the time in local news footage and press reports. Beyond the Zodiac episode, Maupin’s cultural footprint includes television adaptations of Tales of the City and the depiction of the 1978 letter controversy in the 2007 film Zodiac.

_An American novelist and San Francisco Chronicle columnist best known for Tales of the City. In 1978, he alerted authorities after noticing similarities between anonymous “fan letters” he’d received and a new Zodiac letter, which led to an internal inquiry and Inspector Dave Toschi’s removal from the Zodiac case; Toschi admitted sending the fan letters but denied writing the Zodiac letter and was later cleared of that allegation_

Armistead Jones Maupin Jr., born in Washington, D.C., and raised in Raleigh, North Carolina, is an American writer whose Tales of the City began as a 1974 newspaper serial before moving to the San Francisco Chronicle in 1976 and later becoming a celebrated nine‑novel series and multiple screen adaptations. 
While writing his Chronicle serial, Maupin consulted SFPD Inspector Dave Toschi in 1976 to shape a fictional homicide detective, and soon received anonymous fan letters praising Toschi that he later concluded were fabricated by Toschi himself. 
After a new missive purporting to be from the Zodiac arrived at the Chronicle on April 24, 1978—containing lines such as “This is the Zodiac speaking I am back with you. Tell herb caen I am here” and mentioning “that city pig toschi”—Maupin reported his concerns to SFPD, prompting an investigation; Toschi admitted writing the fan letters to Maupin and was reassigned from homicide but publicly denied writing the 1978 Zodiac letter and was later exonerated of that accusation. Maupin’s role in surfacing the letter controversy linked him directly to one of the case’s most scrutinized episodes, documented at the time in local news footage and press reports. 
Beyond the Zodiac episode, Maupin’s cultural footprint includes television adaptations of Tales of the City and the depiction of the 1978 letter controversy in the 2007 film Zodiac. In later years, Maupin lived in New Mexico and, from 2019, in London’s Clapham; he became a British citizen in 2023.

Death: January 13, 1997\n\nPlaces Lived: Glen Cove, Coleman County, Texas (birth); Vallejo, California; Indian Valley/Greenville, Plumas County, California (later years)\n\nShort Bio: Vallejo Police Department sergeant who played a central role in the 1971 multi-agency investigation of Zodiac suspect Arthur Leigh Allen and earlier evaluated Darlene Ferrin’s ex-husband Jim Phillips (Crabtree). U.S. Navy WWII veteran; retired after 25 years with VPD; later portrayed in David Fincher’s film “Zodiac.”\n\nBiography:\n- Career and life. Born in Texas, Mulanax served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, worked as a rigger at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, then joined the Vallejo Police Department in 1950 and retired as a sergeant after 25 years. He belonged to the Retired Peace Officers Association and Vallejo Elks. He later lived in Indian Valley/Greenville, Plumas County, California, and died there in 1997; he is interred at Sunrise Memorial Cemetery in Vallejo. He married Thelma Bryne in 1967; after retirement they moved to Greenville; following his death she returned to the Vallejo area and was later interred with him at Sunrise Memorial Cemetery.\n- Role in the Zodiac investigation. As a VPD detective/sergeant, Mulanax conducted and documented significant 1971 investigative work on Arthur Leigh Allen in coordination with SFPD Inspectors Dave Toschi and Bill Armstrong and California DOJ Agent Mel Nicolai. On July 27, 1971, he met with Toschi, Armstrong, and Nicolai in Vallejo to plan next steps; on August 4, 1971, Mulanax, Toschi, and Armstrong interviewed Allen at the Union Oil refinery in Pinole, during which Allen referenced knives with “chicken” blood and wore a Zodiac-branded watch with the crossed-circle symbol; Mulanax also pursued background interviews with recreation officials Ted Kidder and Philip Tucker and Allen’s associates.\n- Earlier Vallejo work on connected figures. In a February 3, 1970 Vallejo PD report, Detective Mulanax recorded his opinion that Darlene Ferrin’s ex-husband, Jim Phillips (also known as James Phillips Crabtree), was “in no way connected” with her murder after police inquiry—an assessment consistent with the department’s findings at the time.\n- Cultural link. The 2007 feature film “Zodiac” depicts Vallejo’s Sgt. Jack Mulanax (portrayed by Elias Koteas) among the principal investigators portrayed from Vallejo, Napa, and San Francisco agencies.\n\nEvents:\n- 2/3/1970 — VPD report by Det. Jack Mulanax: concluded Jim Phillips (Crabtree) “in no way connected” with the murder of Darlene Ferrin.\n- 7/27/1971 — Meeting in Vallejo (Mulanax, SFPD Inspectors Dave Toschi and Bill Armstrong, DOJ Agent Mel Nicolai) to coordinate the Arthur Leigh Allen inquiry.\n- 8/4/1971 — Interview of Arthur Leigh Allen at Union Oil refinery in Pinole by Mulanax, Toschi, and Armstrong; Mulanax documented Allen’s statements and the Zodiac-brand watch; subsequent background interviews followed (e.g., GVRD officials).\n\nRelatives:\n- Spouse: Thelma Bryne Mulanax (m. 1967; d. 2021).\n\nGroups a member of or places worked:\n- Vallejo Police Department (Sergeant; 25 years).\n- U.S. Navy (WWII service).\n- Mare Island Naval Shipyard (civilian rigger, pre- and post-war prior to VPD service).\n- Retired Peace Officers Association; Vallejo Elks.\n\nSource links:\n- https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/228855608/jack_doyle-mulanax\n- https://www.timesheraldonline.com/obituaries/thelma-bryne-mulanax/\n- https://zodiackillerfacts.com/allen.htm\n- https://zodiackillerfacts.com/myths-legends/darlene-ferrin-myths-the-beginning/darlene-ferrin-and-the-unidentified-man/\n- https://www.zodiackiller.com/MulanaxReport1.html\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac_(film)""}",2025-09-28T20:57:28.000Z,2025-09-05T04:33:39.000Z,"{""isStale"": true, ""state"": ""generated"", ""value"": ""Name: Jack Doyle Mulanax\n\nRole in Case: Law Enforcement (Vallejo Police Department), Deceased, Key Figure\n\nDate of Birth: February 8, 1922\n\nDate of Death: January 13, 1997\n\nPlaces Lived: Glen Cove, Coleman County, Texas (birth); Vallejo, California; Indian Valley/Greenville, Plumas County, California (later years)\n\nShort Bio: Vallejo Police Department sergeant who played a central role in the 1971 multi-agency investigation of Zodiac suspect Arthur Leigh Allen and earlier evaluated Darlene Ferrin’s ex-husband Jim Phillips (Crabtree).

Born in Berkeley, California, he moved to Sacramento in 1917 at the age of three, where he would spend most of his professional career.\n\nProfessional Career\nMorrill worked for many years with the California State Criminal Identification and Investigation Bureau, where he was estimated to have testified in court over 2,500 times. In the early 1970s, he transitioned to working independently as an \""examiner of questioned documents.\""\n\nZodiac Killer Investigation\nIn the Zodiac Killer case, Morrill was a crucial figure in analyzing the handwriting of the letters sent to police and newspapers. He was instrumental in identifying that the various communications were written by a single author. His expertise was particularly valuable in attempting to authenticate and analyze the cryptic communications from the unidentified serial killer.\n\nNotable Cases\nBeyond the Zodiac Killer investigation, Morrill worked on several other high-profile cases, including:\n- Identifying Howard Hughes' signature in the Clifford Irving literary hoax\n- Matching Juan Corona to a \""death list\"" of murdered farm laborers\n- Analyzing the Angela Davis case\n\nProfessional Philosophy\nMorrill was known for his meticulous approach to document examination. He once remarked, \""Sometimes you feel like you're playing God when you shouldn't be. And you're not allowed even one mistake in this field. If you err, you are cross-examined fiercely.\""\n\nPersonal Life\nMorrill was married to Rose and had several children: Kevin and Curtis Lee Morrill (both of Sacramento), Terry Sherwood Morrill (of Emporia, Kansas), and Sandra Jean Smith (of Chico). He also had stepchildren Judy Crews, Susan Henricks, and Gregory Brower, all from Sacramento.\n\nDeath\nSherwood Morrill passed away at the age of 73 in his Sacramento-area home.

Private services have been held for **Sherwood Morrill**, an analyst of questioned documents who worked on such well-known cases as Angela Davis, Juan Corona, Clifford Irving, and the Zodiac killer.

Mr. Morrill, a longtime state employee before going into business for himself in the early 1970s, died Saturday in his Sacramento-area home. He was **73**.

After years of work with the state’s Criminal Identification and Investigation Bureau—where it is estimated he testified in court more than 2,500 times—he went to work for himself as an “examiner of questioned documents.”

Among his most famous cases was the **Zodiac** inquiry, in which Mr. Morrill identified handwriting on taunting letters sent to police and newspapers as the work of a single author, whether publicly or privately written.

In other noted cases, he identified Howard Hughes’ signature in the Clifford Irving literary hoax affair, and matched convicted killer Juan Corona to the “death list” of murdered farm laborers.

In more than 50 years of analysis, he studied forged checks and questionable deeds, wills, and suicide notes; analyzed handwriting; and attempted the restoration of charred documents.

> “Sometimes you feel like you’re playing God when you shouldn’t be,” he told _The Bee_ in 1974. “And you’re not allowed even one mistake in this field. If you err, you are cross-examined fiercely.”

Mr. Morrill was born in Berkeley but moved with his family to Sacramento in 1917 when he was 3 years old.

He is survived by his wife, Rose; children Kevin and Curtis Lee Morrill, both of Sacramento; Terry Sherwood Morrill of Emporia, Kan.; and Sandra Jean Smith of Chico; stepchildren Judy Crews, Susan Henricks, and Gregory Brower of Sacramento; and eight grandchildren.

The family requests that any remembrances be made to the American Cancer Society, P.O. Box 16038, Sacramento, 95816, or Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, 6201 Florin-Perkins Road, Sacramento, 95828.

Son of Ralph A. Spinelli, Sr. (deceased) and Muriel (Cassenelli) Pfleiger, brother of Lynda, Cherie, Jessica, and Neil. Ralph grew up in Vallejo, spending his life throughout California, Oregon, and Nevada. Ralph is survived by his two sons, Tony and Chris, and his grandchildren, Sofia and Enzo.
Ralph was known for his engaging personality, his joyous sense of humor, and his pride of his family. He had a passion for life, for Italian culture, sports, and cars. He was fortunate in his life to enjoy many incredible experiences, but none brought him more joy than the time he spent with his family.
Ralph spent his early career working in the restaurant business, owning and operating establishments throughout Northern California, Nevada, and Oregon. Later in life, he went on to found his own restaurant consulting company, working to support operators large and small.
Ralph's life was interrupted, but not defined, by two separate incarcerations. During his third act, he dedicated his life to education, earning his BA from University of San Francisco, his MFA from St. Mary's, and was earning his Doctorate from University of California. Drawing on his life experiences, Ralph became heavily involved in writing and prison reform, and became a published author on the topic. His dedication to his craft afforded him opportunities to engage and influence many policy makers, educators, and students alike, and will shape lives for years to come.
For those who knew him, he will be remembered for his pride, his passion, and his personality. An outgoing man with lots to give, he will be dearly missed by his immediate and extended family. In lieu of flowers, the family requests any donations be made to the [American Cancer Society](https://donate.cancer.org/?campaign=fcat&giftFirstName=Ralph&giftLastName=Spinelli&giftType=mem).

CHESTER CLARK KLINGEL Jr. May 27,1926 ~ January 17, 2017 Chester Clark Klingel Jr. ""Chet"" was born in San Francisco CA to Alice Marjorie Stewart and Chester Clark Klingel. He grew up in Alameda CA. As a youth he enjoyed playing in the bay, raising pigeons, hopping trains, and selling peanuts at Stanford ball games. At fifteen, he lied about his age and joined the Merchant Marines. He sailed the South Pacific on the Matthew P. Deady, a liberty ship. He contracted Tuberculosis, was in an asylum in Livermore, then went to Yosemite to recuperate. He enlisted in the Army, trained at Fort Bliss, Texas, served on Guam, at Hanford Plutonium works, WA and San Francisco Presidio doing radar repair. 
After honorable discharge, he worked at North American Aviation developing oscilloscopes. He farmed in the Armargosa desert, then returned to SF to work for Fireman's Fund Insurance. Chet's first wife Yolanda passed away in a car accident. His second marriage was short but his third to Blandina Sarkis added love, happiness, family and great food to his life. 
He had many good years in Tam Valley, CA, before beginning a farming venture near Turlock, CA. Chet and Blandina bought nut orchards and developed a successful walnut hulling and drying business. 
After Blandina passed away, the farming project lost appeal. Chet sold the farm and moved to Eureka, CA, where he made new friends. He spent his last decade working on winning the sweepstakes and enjoying his breakfast club friends Wesley, Joe, Chris, Pansy, and Joyce. Chet loved the ocean, bays, pigeons, building projects, his friends, driving, Yosemite, barbequing, pinching Blandina's nose, and singing. 
Chester is survived by his son Schubert Simon Sarkis, his daughters Joanne Carr, Jeannette Smith, Sandra Klingel, and other family members including: Maribel Pairan and family, Eshmael and Lucy Sarkis and family, Nahrine, Orlando and Jessica Mazariegos, Emanuel Malik, Ramina Emanoud, Yda, Allen, Arielle and David Filiberti, Elizabeth, Andy and Danny Oppo, Fred Sacco, Rosanna Sacco-Colas, Robert, Dorothy, Brian, and Erin Moy.

**OFFENSE:** 187 P.C. Murder **CASE NO:** V-25564 **RO:** DET/SGT LUNDBLAD **STATEMENT:** STELLA MEDEIROS, WFA age 32, P.O. Box 477, Vallejo, CA (644-[redacted])
MRS MEDEIROS is the former STELLA BORGES. She lives on Lake Herman Road across from her parents house, two and seven-tenth's miles from the scene of the crime.
MRS MEDEIROS relates that she came in from Oakland at approximately 10:50PM. Her mother called on the telephone and requested that she pick up her son, age 13, at the show. She states that she did not take her coat off, and glanced at the clock in the kitchen and she believes it was 11:10PM. She rode with her mother-in-law and her daughter and drove casually over the 2-7/10th miles, this time the distance being established by the officers, and she arrived at the area four or five minutes later. She estimates between 11:14 and 11:15 PM. Her clock is one minute fast as we had found out during this interview. She states that no cars were going in either direction while she

was on the road. When she arrived at the scene, headlights picked up the car and she observed a boy and he looked like he had fallen out of the open door. The girl was lying on her side facing the road. She had a purple dress on and looked well dressed. She saw only one car at the scene. It looked like a Rambler, grayish in color, it had a chrome rack on the top. This fits the description of the FARADAY Rambler. She states that she drove sixty or seventy miles an hour enroute to Benicia to report the incident. When she saw the police car she honked her horn and blinked her lights to attract the attention of the police officers.

### Early life and background
\- Education and interests: Best graduated from San Francisco’s Lowell High School in the 1950s and studied criminology at City College of San Francisco before working as a rare‑book dealer.
\- “Ice Cream Romance” scandal (1961–1962): At age 28, Best began a predatory relationship with a 13–14‑year‑old girl, Judith “Judy/Jude” Chandler, whom he met outside an ice cream shop; the San Francisco press covered the case and dubbed it the “Ice Cream Romance.” After an elopement and annulment, subsequent flights across state lines, and a hospital escape episode, Best was arrested and imprisoned for statutory rape; the Chronicle’s coverage included a 1962 jail interview where Best downplayed the age difference, saying, “I love Judy and she loves me”.
\- Baton Rouge abandonment (1963): While on the run, the couple’s infant son (later named Gary Stewart) was abandoned in a Baton Rouge apartment building stairwell; both Best and Chandler were subsequently taken into custody by authorities, and Stewart was adopted locally, events documented decades later by The Advocate’s reporting around Stewart’s book.
\- Scene and associations: After parole, Best returned to San Francisco and, according to contemporaneous accounts later summarized by the San Francisco Chronicle/SFGATE, socialized with Anton LaVey (Church of Satan) and played music with Bobby Beausoleil, who was later convicted in a Manson‑related murder in Los Angeles—color that reflects his circles but does not connect him to the Zodiac crimes.

### Role in the Zodiac case
Best was not publicly a Zodiac suspect during the original investigation. Decades later, his son Gary L. Stewart advanced the theory that Best matched the Zodiac composite sketch and elements of the letters, first in the 2014 book The Most Dangerous Animal of All and then in the 2020 FX/Hulu docuseries; these works brought Best’s name into the modern suspect lists and public discourse.
Major Bay Area reporting contemporaneous with the docuseries characterized the evidence as scant, largely circumstantial, and often rebutted (including contested handwriting comparisons and lack of verifiable links to crime scenes). Reporters concluded there was “almost no evidence” that Best was the Zodiac, and the series itself ultimately undercut the theory; law enforcement has not confirmed Best as a suspect in the case, which remains officially unsolved.
### Later life and death
\- Best died in Mexico City in 1984; press accounts summarize that he had a record that included convictions related to the 1962 case and other charges from later years. Public reporting places no verified nexus between his death in Mexico and the Zodiac case.
\- Family accounts and secondary records state he was buried in an unmarked grave in Mexico City; some compiled records list administrative receipt dates different from the reported date of death, which is common with international filings.

### Errata
\- Best’s life intersected with notable Bay Area subcultures (Satanic Temple circles, underground music), and his later notoriety stems from true‑crime media: the bestselling book The Most Dangerous Animal of All (2014) and the FX/Hulu docuseries (2020), both centered on Stewart’s investigation and the Zodiac’s enduring cultural footprint.
 -The “Ice Cream Romance” was covered in 1962 by Chronicle police reporter Paul Avery, who later became well known for his Zodiac reporting. In a notable coincidence frequently cited in coverage, Judith Chandler later married Rotea Gilford, an SFPD homicide detective who worked high‑profile cases; this connection has been reported as background but is not evidence of Best’s involvement in the Zodiac crimes.

He married the love of his life, Verna Larsen, June 10, 1950. During the next 62 years, they raised three children, two sons Kenneth and Timothy, and a daughter, Laura. Jim entered into the U.S. Army at 17, at the end of World War II, and became a member of the U.S. Air Force when it first separated from the Army Air Corp. He served proudly for 20 years, retiring from the Air Force with many distinguishing honors, not the least becoming one of the original Chief Master Sergeants after the rank of E-9 was created. Shortly after retiring from his military service, he worked at Exxon Oil Refinery in Benicia, Calif. as a risk manager. Jim passed quietly at home Thursday morning, Aug. 16, 2012, after a return of the cancer. In addition to his three children, Jim is survived by nine grandchildren; and 14 great- grandchildren. Memorial services will be at 1 p.m., Wednesday, Aug. 22, at Palm Mortuary, 7600 S. Eastern Ave., Las Vegas, NV 89123.

He attended local schools, graduating from Napa High School in 195 and later receiving his Associate of Arts degree from Napa Junior College.

In the late 1950's he joined the U.S.Army as a military policeman and served at Fort Ord and later in Frankfurt, Germany. For many years he worked the Lake Berryessa region as a park ranger for Napa County, retiring in 1989. He thoroughly enjoyed his retirement years by working part time with his friends at Pridmore Brothers Construction Company as well as gardening, hunting, cooking and baking bread, which he generously shared with family and friends.

He leaves behind his father, William Land, brother and sister-in-law, Raymond and Linda Land, a nephew, Christian Land, and many friends. Services will be private.

sitting for Dean and Darlene Ferrin. Again, reiterated the months were from January through May of 1969. Stated she quit in May to overcome some guilt that she was feeling about covering up for Darlene's running around with other men while she was married to Dean. One of the men mentioned was the surviving victim in the Vallejo homicide Michael Mageau.

Karen relates one incident that allegedly occurred while she was babysitting in approximately February or March 1969 at 560 Wallace. She stated she was babysitting approximately 10:00 p.m. one night, was looking out the front window of the Ferrin's apartment, and she noticed a man whom she took to be middleaged sitting in a white American-made sedan watching the apartment. She stated he was there for several hours but left before Dean returned from work shortly after midnight. She stated she could not really describe this individual and only knew he was middleaged because he either turned on the inside car light or lit a cigarette so that she got a partial look at the man. She did not note the license number and was only certain of the approximate age - middleaged, and the fact that the sedan was white.

The following day she related this incident to Darlene Ferrin who at the time recalled was in the bathroom putting on her makeup to go out. Darlene asked her what the car and the man looked like, and after relating a description to her, Dee said something to the effect, ""I guess he's checking up on me again. I heard he was back from out of state."" Followed by, ""He doesn't want anyone to know what I (meaning Darlene) saw him do. I saw him murder someone.""

Karen stated that Dee sometime during this conversation mentioned the man's name, and that the first name was very short, three or four letters and that the second name was just slightly longer. The name was quite common. Karen stated that Dee appeared to be genuinely frightened of this individual.

and mentioned sometime that he had been checking up on her at Terry's Restaurant where Darlene was employed.

At the conclusion of her statement, Reporting Officer discussed with Karen the possibility of her recalling exactly what the name might have been, and a better description of the individual if she were to undergo hypnosis. Stated that she never had any experience with this, but that she would be willing to submit to anything that may assist in the investigation. At this time Reporting Officer advised Karen that arrangements would be made for a session with a hypnotist to see if we could produce more information, and that Reporting Officer would be in contact.

On 6-15-77, Reporting Officer contacted Lieutenant Larry Haynes, Concord Police Department, phone 415-671-3030, in regards to the hypnotic session. Lieutenant Haynes has been trained in this by the Law Enforcement Hypnotic Institute in Los Angeles Police Department and has had much experience in this area. When asked as to the feasibility of such an examination with an 8-year time span, Lieutenant Haynes replied much success has been had regardless of the number of years that has passed. Advised Lieutenant Haynes that the interview primarily would focus on Karen's ability to recall a name told to her by the Zodiac victim Darlene Ferrin and possibly focus on a painting party that occurred at Darlene Ferrin's residence where possibly the alleged subject was in attendance. Lieutenant Haynes agreed to assist. An appointment was made for 6-16-77 at 1300 hours. Reporting Officer then re-contacted Karen [REDACTED], advised her of the appointment set for 1300 hours. She agreed to meet Reporting Officer at the Vallejo Police Department.

He also worked for the KTIM radio station, where the call letters supposedly look like the same cryptic symbols that the Zodiac used in his letters.
Marshall's prints did not match the fingerprints that were collected from the Zodiac leters or crime scenes. However, this evidence can't conclusively rule him out as a suspect because we don't know everything. Marshall's handwriting had some notable similarities to that of the Zodiac.

Kjell Qvale, who fell in love with a forest-green, wire-wheel MG sports car in the 1940s and went on to become one of the earliest American importers of European cars, ultimately selling a million automobiles as a distributor and dealer, died on Nov. 1 in San Francisco. He was 94.
His family announced the death.
As a recently discharged Navy veteran, the Norwegian-born Kjell Qvale (pronounced shell KAH-vah-leh) entered the car business in 1946, using $8,500 in savings to invest in a Jeep dealership in Alameda, Calif. He had no particular passion for cars at the time; to him, this was strictly a business proposition.
It was also strictly business when he made a trip to New Orleans to meet with an importer to discuss expanding his line by adding James motorcycles, a not-terribly-fast British make known for its Jeep-like practicality. There, Mr. Qvale found himself standing on a street corner when “this goofy-looking car pulls up to the curb in front of me,” he said in an interview in 2008. He asked the driver where it was made.
“England,” the driver said.
The car was the MG, and the driver turned out to be the importer of motorcycles he had come to see. He gave Mr. Qvale a ride.
It also turned out that the importer was looking for someone to market MGs in Northern California. Mr. Qvale returned to Alameda, which is just south of Oakland, Calif., sold the Jeep franchise and became an MG distributor.
The MG, the first imported sports car to appear in significant numbers on American highways, has been called “the sports car America loved first.” Its precision handling, accurate steering and zip made going to the grocery store a pleasure.
“It’s fun to drive,” Mr. Qvale told The Wall Street Journal in 1960.
In 2005, the trade publication Automotive News said the MG’s postwar popularity in the United States “was largely because of one man, Kjell Qvale.” It characterized him as “the most imaginative and probably the hardest-working” importer.
Mr. Qvale added more British cars — Aston Martin, Austin, Austin-Healey, Jaguar, Morris, Bentley and Rolls-Royce — and became the exclusive distributor of these brands in Northern California and other parts of the West. (His dealership sold more Austin-Healey 3000s than any other American.) He later added the German cars Volkswagen and Porsche and, later still, Japanese makes.
At his peak, around 1970, he operated 100 dealerships. He estimated that as a wholesale distributor and retail dealer, he sold a million cars representing 36 makes.
Mr. Qvale’s impact in popularizing sportier, more luxurious European cars in the West is often compared to that of Max Hoffman, the celebrated New York car importer who commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright to design his Manhattan showroom.
Mr. Qvale, like Mr. Hoffman, overcame stiff obstacles. He persuaded reluctant banks to finance his unfamiliar breeds of car and insurance companies to insure them. He also had the logistically demanding task of providing parts and service for the foreign brands.
He promoted sports cars by sponsoring rallies, time trials and other competitions. In 1949, he organized the first postwar sports car race in the West at Buchanan Field in Concord, Calif. The next year, he was chairman of the first sports car race in the forest at Pebble Beach, Calif. To accompany the race, he proposed a show of classic cars; it became the [Pebble Beach Concours d’Élégance](http://www.pebblebeachconcours.net/), one of the top events in the world for car collectors.
In 1956, when the Pebble Beach race moved to nearby Fort Ord, an Army base, Mr. Qvale contributed to the design of its famously treacherous corkscrew at turns 8 and 8A of what is now [Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca](http://www.mazdaraceway.com/corkscrew-passport). He also organized a sports car race on the public roads of Golden Gate Park in San Francisco and teamed up with the racecar designer Joe Huffaker to race MGs at Indianapolis in the mid-1960s.
Kjell Qvale was born on July 17, 1919, in Trondheim, Norway, about 225 miles north of Oslo. His father, Bjarne, was a sea captain who commanded a freighter that operated between Chile and Seattle. The elder Mr. Qvale decided to leave the merchant marine and settle in the Pacific Northwest because it reminded him of Norway. Kjell was 10 when his mother took him and his four siblings to join their father.
As a boy, Kjell sold vegetable graters and phonograph needles door to door and had a newspaper delivery route. He was a track star in high school and won an athletic scholarship to the University of Washington, where he was captain of the track team. He once ran the 100-yard dash in 9.6 seconds in a collegiate meet.
He joined the Navy after Pearl Harbor and flew transport planes in the Pacific during World War II. A wartime friend who was the San Francisco-area distributor for Willys-Overland Motors, which made Jeeps, helped him get the Alameda franchise.
In 1970, Mr. Qvale teamed up with the car designer Donald Healey to buy Jensen Motors, and together they developed the Jensen-Healey, a powerful sports car with a Lotus 907 engine. They sold the car from 1972 to 1976. As majority shareholder in Jensen Motors, Mr. Qvale also sought to acquire Rolls-Royce but was unsuccessful.
In 1998, Mr. Qvale and his sons, Jeff and Bruce, bought the rights to make the DeTomaso Mangusta, a high-performance sports car. They made and sold several hundred before selling the rights and manufacturing plant to the MG Rover group in 2001.
Mr. Qvale’s other business interests included Brittania Jeans and the First National Bank of Marin. He bred and raced thoroughbreds and for a time owned the renowned come-from-behind racehorse Silky Sullivan. He also financed women’s professional tennis.
Mr. Qvale’s wife of 57 years (and his business associate for even longer), the former Kay Curry, died in 2005. He is survived by his sons, seven grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
Always eager to try something new, Mr. Qvale started taking piano lessons at 90.

He received his early education at Lakeside School in Seattle, graduating in 1949. Lakeside School is a prestigious private preparatory school whose notable alumni include Microsoft co-founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen. Anthony went on to attend Harvard University, graduating in 1953.\n\n**PERSONAL LIFE**\n\nIn 1956, Anthony married Valerie Ann Moore in California. The couple initially lived in San Marino, California for ten years before relocating to San Francisco, which became their long-time home. They also maintained a second residence in Inverness, located in the Point Reyes National Seashore area, where Anthony enjoyed landscaping and remodeling projects.\n\nAnthony and Valerie had two sons: Peter Anthony (who predeceased him) and Marc Anthony. He was also survived by his grandson Jason Anthony, sister Harriet Botelho, and brother James Anthony.\n\n**PROFESSIONAL CAREER**\n\nAnthony worked in retail and wholesale businesses until 1976. That year marked a significant change when his wife Valerie founded Sterne School, a San Francisco institution dedicated to educating children with learning differences. Anthony became the school's Business Manager, taking on multiple responsibilities including building maintenance and general operations. The couple retired in 2000 and divided their time between Inverness and Spokane before making Spokane their permanent home in 2005.\n\n**CONNECTION TO THE ZODIAC KILLER CASE**\n\n**The Paul Stine Murder**\n\nOn October 11, 1969, San Francisco taxi driver Paul Stine was shot and killed in his cab at the intersection of Washington and Cherry Streets in the Presidio Heights neighborhood. This murder became the last confirmed killing attributed to the Zodiac Killer.\n\n**Witness Identification**\n\nAnthony's connection to the case emerged through a Department of Justice document dated November 6, 1969, which was later released through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. The document states: \""FOR INFO IDENT DIVISION, SAN FRANCISCO PD ADVISED EIGHT YEAR OLD WITNESS IN MURDER OF CAB DRIVER IDENTIFIED XENOPHON L. ANTHONY AS POSSIBLE SUBJECT IN THIS MATTER\"".\n\nAt the time of the Stine murder, Anthony was 38 years old and resided at 3218 Jackson Street in San Francisco. This address was located in close proximity to the crime scene—approximately five and a half blocks from Washington and Cherry Streets.\n\n**Geographic Context**\n\nAnthony's residence at 3218 Jackson Street placed him between Presidio Avenue and Walnut Street, literally off Presidio Avenue where Officer Donald Fouke's patrol car had come from on the night of the murder. Officer Fouke reported encountering a white male adult in the area shortly after the murder, though the suspect description was initially miscommunicated to responding officers.\n\n**Age and Physical Description**\n\nAnthony's age in 1969 (38 years old) fell within the range described by Officer Fouke, who estimated the suspect he observed was between 35-45 years old. This alignment with witness descriptions added to the interest in Anthony as a potential suspect.\n\n**Investigation Status**\n\nThe name \""Xenophon L. Anthony\"" was not publicly released until 2016, following Anthony's death in January of that year. Under privacy laws, the Department of Justice was able to release the previously redacted name because deceased individuals are exempt from such protections, following the Latin legal maxim \""Actio personalis moritur cum persona\"" (a personal action dies with the person).\n\nThe extent of the San Francisco Police Department's investigation into Anthony remains unclear. No official police reports from October 1969 mention the eight-year-old witness or Anthony's identification. Inspector Armond Pelissetti's report from the night of the incident, which listed three teenage witnesses by name, made no mention of either the child witness or Anthony.\n\n**LATER LIFE AND DEATH**\n\nAnthony spent his final years in Spokane, Washington, where he resided at Touchmark's Skilled Nursing Unit for the last nineteen months of his life. He died on January 17, 2016, at the age of 84. Memorial contributions were directed to Sterne School at 2690 Jackson Street, San Francisco, the institution he and his wife had dedicated much of their lives to building.\n\n**CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CONTEXT**\n\nThe Zodiac Killer case remains one of America's most infamous unsolved serial murder investigations. The killer claimed responsibility for at least 37 murders in letters sent to newspapers, though investigators have confirmed seven assault victims. The case has generated thousands of suspects over the decades, with approximately 2,300 individuals investigated by authorities.\n\nAnthony's emergence as a named suspect decades after the crimes highlights the ongoing nature of the investigation and the continued efforts by researchers to identify previously unknown leads. However, no definitive evidence has publicly emerged linking Anthony to the Zodiac crimes, and he was never charged with any offense related to the case.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** This biography is based solely on publicly available information. Anthony was identified as a suspect but was never charged with any crime related to the Zodiac Killer case.

He received his early education at Lakeside School in Seattle, graduating in 1949. Lakeside School is a prestigious private preparatory school whose notable alumni include Microsoft co-founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen. Anthony went on to attend Harvard University, graduating in 1953.
**PERSONAL LIFE**
In 1956, Anthony married Valerie Ann Moore in California. The couple initially lived in San Marino, California for ten years before relocating to San Francisco, which became their long-time home. They also maintained a second residence in Inverness, located in the Point Reyes National Seashore area, where Anthony enjoyed landscaping and remodeling projects.
Anthony and Valerie had two sons: Peter Anthony (who predeceased him) and Marc Anthony. He was also survived by his grandson Jason Anthony, sister Harriet Botelho, and brother James Anthony.
**PROFESSIONAL CAREER**
Anthony worked in retail and wholesale businesses until 1976. That year marked a significant change when his wife Valerie founded Sterne School, a San Francisco institution dedicated to educating children with learning differences. Anthony became the school's Business Manager, taking on multiple responsibilities including building maintenance and general operations. The couple retired in 2000 and divided their time between Inverness and Spokane before making Spokane their permanent home in 2005.
**CONNECTION TO THE ZODIAC KILLER CASE**
**The Paul Stine Murder**
On October 11, 1969, San Francisco taxi driver Paul Stine was shot and killed in his cab at the intersection of Washington and Cherry Streets in the Presidio Heights neighborhood. This murder became the last confirmed killing attributed to the Zodiac Killer.
**Witness Identification**
Anthony's connection to the case emerged through a Department of Justice document dated November 6, 1969, which was later released through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. The document states: ""FOR INFO IDENT DIVISION, SAN FRANCISCO PD ADVISED EIGHT YEAR OLD WITNESS IN MURDER OF CAB DRIVER IDENTIFIED XENOPHON L. ANTHONY AS POSSIBLE SUBJECT IN THIS MATTER"".
At the time of the Stine murder, Anthony was 38 years old and resided at 3218 Jackson Street in San Francisco. This address was located in close proximity to the crime scene—approximately five and a half blocks from Washington and Cherry Streets.
**Geographic Context**
Anthony's residence at 3218 Jackson Street placed him between Presidio Avenue and Walnut Street, literally off Presidio Avenue where Officer Donald Fouke's patrol car had come from on the night of the murder. Officer Fouke reported encountering a white male adult in the area shortly after the murder, though the suspect description was initially miscommunicated to responding officers.
**Age and Physical Description**
Anthony's age in 1969 (38 years old) fell within the range described by Officer Fouke, who estimated the suspect he observed was between 35-45 years old. This alignment with witness descriptions added to the interest in Anthony as a potential suspect.
**Investigation Status**
The name ""Xenophon L. Anthony"" was not publicly released until 2016, following Anthony's death in January of that year. Under privacy laws, the Department of Justice was able to release the previously redacted name because deceased individuals are exempt from such protections, following the Latin legal maxim ""Actio personalis moritur cum persona"" (a personal action dies with the person).
The extent of the San Francisco Police Department's investigation into Anthony remains unclear. No official police reports from October 1969 mention the eight-year-old witness or Anthony's identification. Inspector Armond Pelissetti's report from the night of the incident, which listed three teenage witnesses by name, made no mention of either the child witness or Anthony.
**LATER LIFE AND DEATH**
Anthony spent his final years in Spokane, Washington, where he resided at Touchmark's Skilled Nursing Unit for the last nineteen months of his life. He died on January 17, 2016, at the age of 84. Memorial contributions were directed to Sterne School at 2690 Jackson Street, San Francisco, the institution he and his wife had dedicated much of their lives to building.
**CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CONTEXT**
The Zodiac Killer case remains one of America's most infamous unsolved serial murder investigations. The killer claimed responsibility for at least 37 murders in letters sent to newspapers, though investigators have confirmed seven assault victims. The case has generated thousands of suspects over the decades, with approximately 2,300 individuals investigated by authorities.
Anthony's emergence as a named suspect decades after the crimes highlights the ongoing nature of the investigation and the continued efforts by researchers to identify previously unknown leads. However, no definitive evidence has publicly emerged linking Anthony to the Zodiac crimes, and he was never charged with any offense related to the case.

Starting in April 1969 the _San Francisco Express Times_ changed its name to **_Good Times_**, publishing under that title with a substantially different editorial policy, lasting until August 2, 1972.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Express_Times#cite_note-loc2-2) In 2021, _[Newsweek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek)_ referred to _Good Times_ as an ""anti-police and pro-violence"" publication.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Express_Times#cite_note-Newsweek-3)

**Publication history**

**_Express Times_**
Marvin Garson was a graduate of the University of California and a veteran of the Berkeley [Free Speech Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Speech_Movement), where he edited an FSM newsletter, _Wooden Shoe_, along with his wife [Barbara Garson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Garson). He started the _Express Times_ with co-founder [Bob Novick](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bob_Novick&action=edit&redlink=1).[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Express_Times#cite_note-4) Some members of the _[San Francisco Oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Oracle)_ collective were also involved in the paper's birth.
The _Express Times_ featured a weekly cooking column, _30 Recipes Suitable for Framing_, written by [Alice Waters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Waters) and illustrated by [David Lance Goines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lance_Goines).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Express_Times#cite_note-sighswhispers/11-goines-5) Regular contributors included [Todd Gitlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Gitlin), [Greil Marcus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greil_Marcus), [Paul Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Williams_(Crawdaddy!_creator)), Sandy Darlington, and [Marjorie Heins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Heins).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Express_Times#cite_note-6) Catherine Yronwode, later known for her work in the comics industry, co-wrote a weekly astrology column for the _Express Times_. Staff photographers were Jeffrey Blankfort, followed by Nacio Jan Brown and [Robert Altman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Altman_(photographer)). Cartoons and illustrations were provided by [Jaxon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaxon_(cartoonist)), the syndicated editorial cartoons of [Ron Cobb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Cobb), and [Sharon Rudahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Rudahl).[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Express_Times#cite_note-7)
During the year of its existence, highlights included extensive on-the-scene coverage of student rioting and the prolonged strike at [San Francisco State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_State_University), and Lenny Heller's serialized novel of guerrilla warfare in the United States, _Berkeley Guns_.
In December 1968 editor Marvin Garson spent 20 days in jail in Chicago as a result of his participation as a journalist in a police and protester skirmish during the [Democratic National Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Democratic_National_Convention) in August.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Express_Times#cite_note-8)
Documents released under the [Freedom of Information Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States)) show that the _Express Times_ was one of a number of underground newspapers successfully infiltrated by the [FBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation), which had a paid informant on the staff.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Express_Times#cite_note-9)

**_Good Times_**
The renamed _Good Times_ paper debuted in April 1969; the all-volunteer editorial collective was made up of residents of the Good Times [Commune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_community).[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Express_Times#cite_note-MysteryQuest-10) Under this regime, the paper's contents and publication schedule were a good deal more relaxed than when it was the _San Francisco Express Times_.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)_]
[Jesse Drew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Drew) of the San Francisco digital archive _Found SF_ described _Good Times_ this way:
> _Good Times_ was the paper the [radical left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics) depended upon to keep up with the [anti-war movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-war_movement), the trials of political prisoners like the [Soledad Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soledad_Brothers) and [Angela Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Davis), political corruption in San Francisco, and general communal information like vegetarian recipes and holistic health care. The all-volunteer collective put out _Good Times_ on a regular bi-weekly, weekly, and then twice-a-week basis until sputtering out in the summer of 1972.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Express_Times#cite_note-11)
Underground cartoonist [Harry Driggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Driggs) served as _Good Times_'s art director and staff cartoonist; he recruited fellow underground cartoonists [Trina Robbins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trina_Robbins)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Express_Times#cite_note-12) and [Guy Colwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Colwell)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Express_Times#cite_note-Colwell-13) as contributors (Collwell, in fact, joined the Good Times Commune).[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Express_Times#cite_note-Colwell-13) Writer [Nina Serrano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Serrano) wrote a series of articles on the [Los Siete trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Siete_de_la_Raza) and contributed poetry to _Good Times_.
When _Good Times_ decided to accept [pornographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic) display advertising and classified [sex trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_trade) advertising in early 1970, [feminist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist) staff members staged an action to prevent this from happening.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)_] When male staffers at _Good Times_ tried to put out a special ""Sex"" issue, women staffers stole the mock-ups and page layouts and burned them.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)_]

**Legacy**
In 1977, [Allan Francovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Francovich) and Gene Rosow produced and directed a documentary on the newspaper titled _San Francisco Good Times_, which included appearances by such notable figures as [Pete Townsend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Townshend) of [The Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who) and [Timothy Leary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Leary).[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Express_Times#cite_note-14)
**Connection to the Zodiac Killer case**
The [History Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_(U.S._TV_channel))'s 2009 television program _[MysteryQuest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MysteryQuest)_ speculated that a member of the Good Times Commune, Richard Gaikowski (1936–2004), was a possible suspect in the unsolved San Francisco [Zodiac Killer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac_Killer) case.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Express_Times#cite_note-MysteryQuest-10) His appearance resembled a composite sketch of the killer, and a police dispatcher who had been contacted by the Zodiac, identified a recording of Gaikowski's voice as being the same as the Zodiac's.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Express_Times#cite_note-15)
In 2021, _[Newsweek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek)_ published an article that also mentioned Gaikowski in relation to the Zodiac killings.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Express_Times#cite_note-Newsweek-3)

IF YOU CAME of age in California in the 1960s and were fortunate in your life choices, you no doubt at one time or another experienced the [Renaissance Pleasure Faire](http://renfair.com/socal/). Although it originated in 1963 in Southern California’s Agoura Hills (over 3,000 people attended), the [Northern California Renaissance Pleasure Faire](https://www.norcalrenfaire.com/) also had a memorable run. That one started at [Marin’s China Camp State Park](http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=466) in 1967 and by 1970 had moved to Novato’s hilly Black Point area, where the above photo was taken.
Of course, the fair was headlined as taking place at Black Pointe Forest, for more authentic 16th-century English country flavor. Fair personnel, all 2,500 of them on average, attended 30 different classes and workshops in Elizabethan style and folklore and, once the fair began, wore period attire, including ruffs, jerkins and snoods. Booths in pastoral settings sold handicrafts of the bygone era, madrigal singers entertained and food stands offered fattened turkey legs and tankards of dark ale.
The Renaissance Pleasure Faire was born in the minds of Ron and Phyllis Patterson, an art director and art teacher, respectively; both were adamant that Renaissance history and customs be presented as accurately as possible. The couple lived for many years in Marin and divorced in 1980, and their brainchild was sold in 1994; today, imitator renaissance fairs are held throughout the world. Ron died at age 80 in 2011 while living in a Sausalito floating home; Phyllis, who lived in a log cabin in Novato, passed away in 2014 at 82. Their son Kevin, who grew up during the Renaissance Pleasure Faire’s most successful years and later was active in the business, still lives in Marin. He and his family manage [San Francisco’s annual Dickens Christmas Fair.](https://dickensfair.com/mobile/)

Like most of their neighbors, the Gassers were farmers, and for many years his father was the head dairyman at Napa State Hospital. At their ranch in Coombsville, the family had their own prune orchard, raised turkeys and chickens, and operated a dairy with goats and cows. The Gasser dairy was known for neatness and modern methods of operation, and working in it throughout his childhood taught the young Peter plenty about hard work. In high school, he was annoyed when other boys teased him about his rustic clothes, and left after ninth grade, but he soon went on to earn a banking certificate in San Francisco. He began working for the Bank of Italy (which was to become the Bank of America) in 1925.
Pete’s new job brought him into contact with bankers, local business owners, and other men of influence and power. It also allowed him to dress the part of the promising young businessman, and he impressed the young widow Vernice Wilson, whom he began escorting around Napa. The two were married in 1934. Pete Gasser soon left banking, telling friends that the Bank of America “wouldn’t let him run it the way he wanted to,” and went into business selling used cars in Napa, perhaps with his father’s help. After a rocky beginning he opened his own Dodge agency, promoted with a splashy opening that featured live vaudeville, free movies and branded souvenirs. The agency also sponsored a winning basketball team, who were provided with fine uniforms and chauffeured to the games in shiny late model Dodge cars. Pete Gasser was a natural business promoter, and became known around Napa as the man to talk to for a good deal on an automobile. But Napa suffered big losses during the Depression, and Mr. Gasser felt that the town needed direction from the Chamber of Commerce, which had lost drive and membership, in order to recover and prosper.
As his own business gradually gathered momentum, Pete Gasser gave the Chamber of Commerce new vitality and purpose. Starting as a member-at-large in 1938, he soon moved up to president from 1941-45, and remained influential for a long time afterward. With the national economy beginning to recover, and the possibility of another war in Europe on the horizon, Mr. Gasser insisted that the group take an active part in improving the city – pressuring for annexation of surrounding areas to accommodate new workers, arranging construction of infrastructure, and asking members to build housing for the booming population. The Chamber’s powerful voice was effective in directing Napa development before and during World War II. Under their auspices, Gasser facilitated the widening of Highway 29 between Napa and Vallejo and helped envisage the Napa airport. He was influential in negotiating with the federal government to construct wartime housing, and lobbied for dredging the channel from Carquinez Straits to Napa. At the same time he expanded his own business dealings into heavy trucks and other vehicles. He invested in other local businesses, notably Basalt Rock Company, bought more real estate, and brokered deals for the city.
Though he never ran for elected office, Gasser himself was a major force for change in Napa, with business and civic projects that became almost too numerous to track between 1940 and 1975. His opinions influenced the mayor, supervisors and newspaper, and his influence, or lack of it, could make a project succeed or fail. As president of the Chamber, he was War Fund chairman for the American Red Cross, and was cited for distinguished achievement in raising funds for the group to support troops overseas. He helped bring the Oakland Oaks baseball team to Napa for spring training.
Gasser served on the advisory boards of the Bank of America, Silverado Council of the Boy Scouts, Napa Farm Bureau, and Native Sons of the Golden West, and promoted their interests through the Chamber of Commerce. He presided over the establishment of Robert Louis Stevenson State Park. Following his predecessor Nathan Coombs, Mr. Gasser served on the Golden Gate Bridge Authority, and represented Napa interests to the mayor and supervisors of San Francisco for twenty years. He became director of the Redwood Empire Association, and acted as co-chairman of fundraising efforts to build Queen of the Valley Hospital. He was a generous benefactor of Justin-Siena School. In later years, he helped expedite construction of the Southern Crossing via the Butler bridge south of Napa, a major transit project. In 1965, he sold Gasser Motors to devote himself to real estate and Napa Valley development. The Napa Register’s story quoted him saying that the development of the Napa Valley was “in its infancy,” and that “tremendous growth would be coming to the area in the very near future, after such needs as sanitation, adequate water for industry and domestic use and recreational needs were solved.” With increasing financial resources at hand, Pete Gasser purchased land for many more projects, including the remainder of the 145 acre site of today’s South Napa Marketplace. He envisioned the area along Soscol Avenue between Napa State Hospital and downtown as a major shopping area for the city, and began looking for businesses to make his dream a reality.
Throughout the years, Pete Gasser approached relaxation as he did business–with gusto, in the company of many colleagues and friends. He was known for his “big” personality, and success allowed him to enjoy himself in the rollicking style of his era. An enthusiastic hunter and fisherman who loved the outdoors, he had special fences constructed on his property to accommodate the native deer, and was a major supporter of Ducks Unlimited. He had his pond stocked with rainbow trout, hunted deer in Nevada, and took a state senator salmon fishing in Alaska; he even hunted a polar bear. He also greatly enjoyed golf and was a charter member and the first president of the Silverado Country Club. While keeping his finger on the pulse of Napa, he became the larger than life figure that he clearly wanted to be.
There were the ranch hands he bailed out of jail; the employee with bad credit whom he still backed. Success did not rob him of the pleasure of doing favors for his friends. Yet more than anything else he was an astute businessman who relished envisioning projects and bringing them to fruition. He enjoyed knowing the right people to get things done, and working with them to accomplish the job. In his later days Gasser told a friend that he “hoped to leave something to the world so that I’ll be remembered.” The Gassers had no children, and as Pete had made his money in Napa, he wanted his inheritance to benefit the Napa community. He directed that his legacy be planned in the same way he had lived: carefully, strategically, and with Napa interests at heart. The Gasser Foundation continues the work that Pete would have done himself by contributing to all levels of the Napa community, because–to the end–Pete Gasser believed in Napa, and insisted that this commitment also be put “in black and white.”
The Gasser Foundation, surely, is something wonderfully generous for all Napa citizens to remember him by. Napa native Vernice Gasser was a daughter of the prominent Stoddard family, who arrived in California by wagon train from Michigan in 1871. Her grandfather, William Stoddard, settled in Napa in 1880, and with his sons soon established a prosperous grain and feed business which became one of the largest in the region, milling barley and corn. Vernice’s father, William Stoddard, Jr., died when she was only eleven, leaving her French-born mother Isabelle Ilos Stoddard to carry on the milling business. Though placed in an unusual position for a woman of her time, Mrs. Stoddard proved to be an outstanding manager of business affairs. She became a mortgage lender, began to acquire real estate, and advised other businesses on matters of finance; she worked at Napa’s department store (Albert’s), taught knitting there and in her home, and did volunteer work at the hospital.
In many ways Vernice, who preferred to be called Pat, was to follow her mother in her civic and business interests. Women of her era were beginning to assume greater responsibilities outside the home, and participating, though often behind the scenes, in business decisions. She attended business school in Oakland, where she received a certificate in bookkeeping and typing, and took her first job at Mare Island Naval Yard in 1920. She married John Wilson of Suisun, but after his sudden death in 1930 she returned to Napa and worked as office manager at Albert’s department store. Four years later, she married the up-and-coming young businessman Pete Gasser, and in 1937, the two opened Gasser Motors Dodge Cars & Trucks’ new showroom with a staff of thirty-one. Mrs. Gasser was in charge of bookkeeping and managed the office.
She had done volunteer work during World War I, and when World War II came she again became involved with the Red Cross and other charities. One of them began as “Bundles for Britain”, a war relief organization supporting British servicemen early in World War II; it later supported U.S. servicemen. Pat and other volunteers opened a salvage shop that proved to be such a fundraising success that the group continued to operate after the war on behalf of the Napa community. Pat Gasser was a founding member of the group, now known as Community Projects, and it became her major focus. Over the years she served in the capacities of CP president, treasurer, thrift shop chairman and hospital auxiliary chair, and under her direction an invitation to join CP became a coveted honor. She also spearheaded the purchase of CP’s current location as an investment for the organization. The organization made her a life member in 1986. Outside of Community Projects, Pat Gasser helped raise funds and served as trustee for the Queen of the Valley Hospital Foundation, and was named Woman of the Year by the Napa Business and Professional Women’s Club in recognition of her work for the town.
Pat was an enthusiastic gardener, regularly winning ribbons for her flowers at the Napa Town & Country Fair. She retained a childhood love of horses, and in 1939 helped to organize the Napa Valley Horsemen’s Association. Known around town as a stylish dresser with a taste for beautiful things, she was also an adventurous world traveler, venturing abroad to Asia, South America, and several regions of Africa. Though at heart the dynamic Mrs. Gasser and her husband Pete were intensely private individuals, both felt a lifelong affection for Napa. Mrs. Gasser agreed that establishing the Gasser Foundation as a charitable entity would be the finest and most enduring legacy they could leave their community. When she died in 1989, seven years after her husband, Mrs. Gasser had made sure that these dreams would become a reality. As in life, her closest and most abiding connection was with her hometown.

## **OBITUARY**
Jan. 7, 1921 – Feb. 1, 2009 Attorney William Langley Beeman died on February 1 at Kaiser Hospital in Vallejo. He was 88 years old.
Bill was born on January 7, 1921, in Fort Worth, Texas. He was the 10th of 10 children of Edwin A. and Lucille E. (Shoemake) Beeman. In his early childhood, the family lived on a farm outside of Golden, Oklahoma. Bill moved to Vallejo the first time with his mother, brother Jack and sister Ruth in October of 1928, residing in Hudson Alley. While attending Lincoln Elementary School and Vallejo Junior High School, he helped to support his family by selling newspapers for five years, seven days a week.
In 1933, Bill moved with his mother and brother Jack to Old Town, in San Diego, where he again sold newspapers for most of his high school years. He graduated from Point Loma High School in 1939 and then attended San Diego State College.
While attending college, he worked as a night watchman for the Bill Gibbs Flying School, being paid with flying lessons. Discovering an enormous love of flying, he quickly obtained his commercial and flight instructors’ licenses. Prior to World War II, he taught flying for the Civilian Pilot Training Program in the Imperial Valley. In June of 1941 he became a flight instructor at Falcon Field in Mesa, Arizona, teaching Royal Air Force cadets skills in primary, basic and advanced flying.
In June of 1942, Bill went to work as a co-pilot for Consairway in San Diego, delivering PBYs and B-24s for the war effort. In 1943, he then became a flight captain for Consairway. Flying under contract for the Army and Navy Transport Commands, Bill’s responsibilities took him through the entire South Pacific, including Australia, New Guinea, Fiji Islands, Biak, Funafuti, and Tarawa. Between flights across the South Pacific, he was a test pilot and delivered planes to the East Coast.
In August of 1945, Bill Beeman married Nancy Jane Chandler from Vacaville, and within a few months he was drafted. He served in Korea with the Army Air Office in Seoul, and was honorably discharged in 1947.
Continuing his flying career, he then worked as an instructor with the Vacaville Dixon Flying Service until he moved to Pacific Overseas Airways in Los Angeles and then Peruvian International Airlines in Lima, Peru. When his flying career ended, Bill had completed over 6,000 hours of flying time.
After he was seriously burned in a fuel explosion and experienced significant legal problems as a result, Bill decided to enter the legal profession. In 1949, he started night school at the McGeorge College of Law in Sacramento. During this time, he worked as a bridge tender and telegraph switch operator for the Southern Pacific Railroad. In the last 15 months of law school, he worked as a U.S. Deputy Clerk for the Federal Court. He graduated with distinction from law school as second in his class, and started his own practice in Vallejo in January of 1954.
During his 50 plus years in the practice of law, Attorney Beeman pursued each of his cases with a fiercely competitive spirit, applying his keen intellect, his gift of storytelling, and his loyalty to the rule of law. In short, he hated to lose. In his trial work, no one ever accused Bill Beeman of a lack of effort. Throughout his law practice, he was genuinely interested in his clients, treating each with respect and sincere friendship.
Bill was devoted to Vallejo and Solano County. He led the efforts to establish the Solano County Legal Aid and Mental Health Programs. He was a lifetime member of the NAACP and served as president of the Solano County Bar Association. He enriched many childrens’ lives as a swimming instructor for the YMCA. Bill was also an energetic supporter of the Democratic Party, being involved in the local Democratic Club and in many local campaigns of state and national candidates.
In 1969, he married Eileen Posedel of Vallejo. He enjoyed golf, fishing, and waterskiing. Throughout his whole life, Bill was busy with his law practice, or community work, or political involvement, or writing, or family É all at the same time.
Bill Beeman is survived by his children, Paul L. Beeman (Donna Kenney), Rockne C. Beeman, Kimberly S. Vaughn (Bill), William L. Beeman II, and Frederick P. Beeman; his grandchildren, Lauren, William, Andrew, Ryan and Sarah; and great-grandchild, Kylie.
Services will be held on Saturday, February 21, at 11 a.m. at First United Methodist Church, 502 Virginia Street, Vallejo.
In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the American Lung Association.

Ethan was a decorated U.S. Navy aviator and trainer who graduated from the Naval Academy in 1927 and served from the 1930s through World War II. He flew various aircraft including Curtis Seagulls, Martin T4M Torpedo bombers, and Grumman Hellcats, and served as a Commanding Officer at the Corpus Christi Naval Air Station in 1941. He completed his Navy career in 1947 at San Francisco's Treasure Island Naval Base, retiring as a Lieutenant Commander.\n\nBernice and Ethan had at least two sons: Arthur Leigh Allen (1933-1992) and Ronald Allen.

In February 1991, approximately two years after his mother's death, the Vallejo Police Department executed a search warrant at the residence.

Bernice Velma Hanson was born on May 28, 1905, in Vallejo, Solano County, California. She was the daughter of Arthur Ferdinand Hanson (1876-1963) and Louise Dorothea Medau Hanson (1875-1954).
On June 8, 1931, Bernice married Ethan Warren Allen (1903-1971) in Solano County, California. Ethan was a decorated U.S. Navy aviator and trainer who graduated from the Naval Academy in 1927 and served from the 1930s through World War II. He flew various aircraft including Curtis Seagulls, Martin T4M Torpedo bombers, and Grumman Hellcats, and served as a Commanding Officer at the Corpus Christi Naval Air Station in 1941. He completed his Navy career in 1947 at San Francisco's Treasure Island Naval Base, retiring as a Lieutenant Commander.
Bernice and Ethan had at least two sons: Arthur Leigh Allen (1933-1992) and Ronald Allen. The family resided at 32 Fresno Street in Vallejo, California.
Ethan Warren Allen died on March 17, 1971, in Oakland, Alameda County, California, at the age of 67. Bernice outlived her husband by nearly 18 years, passing away on January 10, 1989, in Sonoma County, California, at the age of 83. Both Bernice and Ethan are interred at Sunrise Memorial Cemetery in Vallejo, in the Palm Court Mausoleum.
**Connection to the Zodiac Killer Case**
Bernice Allen's connection to the Zodiac Killer case stems from her son, Arthur Leigh Allen, who became the primary suspect investigated by law enforcement. Arthur Leigh Allen remains the only person publicly named by police as a suspect in the Zodiac Killer case. The Zodiac Killer was a serial killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area between December 1968 and October 1969, claiming responsibility for multiple murders and sending cryptic letters to the media.
Arthur Leigh Allen lived with his parents at the family home on 32 Fresno Street in Vallejo during the period when the Zodiac murders occurred. According to his brother Ronald Allen, their mother gave Arthur a Zodiac-brand watch as a Christmas gift in 1967, which became a notable detail in the investigation given the killer's self-chosen moniker.
Following Bernice Allen's death in October 1989, Arthur continued to live alone at the Fresno Street residence. In February 1991, approximately two years after his mother's death, the Vallejo Police Department executed a search warrant at the residence. Arthur Leigh Allen died on August 26, 1992, before any formal charges were filed. Despite extensive investigation, DNA and fingerprint evidence ultimately did not conclusively link him to the crimes.

History
[Sidney Brownsberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Brownsberger), PUC's first president**Early years (1882–1908)**
Pacific Union College was founded as **Healdsburg Academy** in [Healdsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healdsburg,_California), [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California), in northern [Sonoma County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoma_County), in 1882.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:4-5)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-pucabout-8) The creation of schools in the state was urged by [Ellen G. White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_G._White) and other church leaders in an effort to accommodate the Adventist Church's growing membership on the [West Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States) and to train young Adventists for its work. The academy officially opened on April 11 of that year. It was the twelfth institution of higher education founded in California, and is the second founded by the Adventist Church, the first west of the [Mississippi River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River).
[Sidney Brownsberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Brownsberger) served as its first President. Under his term, the academy focused on both conventional study of standard subjects as well as practical skills, such as [dressmaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dressmaker), [blacksmithing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacksmith), [carpentry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpentry), and [cooking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking), in line with White's desire for the college.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:4-5)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:8-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-10) The lengthy tenure of William C. Grainger saw the heyday of the Academy's early years, but with the turn of the century, poor financial management led to increasing debt that eventually forced the academy to close in July 1908.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:4-5)[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-11)
**Move to Angwin (1909–1921)**
An early image of Pacific Union College's new campus in Angwin
Despite this failure, many church leaders – including White herself – continued to push for expanded Adventist schooling, and efforts were begun in the 1900s to find a new location to rebuild the college. Many sites were scouted out in the [Central Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Valley_(California)) and elsewhere within the state, but none came to the satisfaction of the searchers.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:4-5)
Eventually, in 1909, the [Pacific Union Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Division_of_Seventh-day_Adventists) announced that it had found an opening to purchase the 1,636 acres of the [Angwin Resort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angwin,_California) on [Howell Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howell_Mountain,_California) in neighboring [Napa County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa_County). The property had been found through the church's St. Helena Sanitarium, and White visited the site in September in 1909.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:9-13) Satisfied with the condition of its facilities and living quarters and the ease with which they could be adapted for teaching purposes, its abundant resources in [springs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(hydrology)) and [lumber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumber), and the healthful living its geography would provide, White approved the location.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:8-9)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:9-13) The property was bought in the same month for $60,000 (roughly $1.9 million in 2022), and opened its doors September 29.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:8-9)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-14) The name of the college was finalized as **Pacific Union College** in 1910 to reflect change in location, even as it had changed names a few times before.
PUC's first president at Angwin was Charles W. Irwin, who served from the opening of the new location until 1921. Irwin's term was marked by [self-sufficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sustainability) as the college adapted to its new location, with both the faculty and student body working to expand the campus through the area's available [natural resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:4-5)
**Early 20th century (1922–1943)**
In the 1920s and 1930s, PUC expanded its educational programs with the goal of receiving [educational accreditation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_accreditation). Driven by suggestions from the college's [board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors), PUC required that professors have [postgraduate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_education) degrees to teach, created lower and [upper divisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_division_college), introduced [major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_major) and [minor degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_minor), and necessitated the completion of [senior theses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis) for graduation. The college also extended funds to pay for faculty members' graduate studies.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:4-5) With these changes, PUC became the first Adventist college to become accredited when it was awarded accreditation by the [Northwest Association of Secondary and Higher Schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Association_of_Secondary_and_Higher_Schools) in 1933.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-jaetimeline-15)
This era also saw further expansion of the campus community through the construction of more facilities – including new men's [dormitories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dormitory) and its current [gymnasium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym) – as well as through the creation of the college's first [student association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students%27_union), the Associated Students of Pacific Union College (ASPUC), in January 1935. The college's student newspaper, the _Campus Chronicle_, published its first issue in 1925 after being adapted from the previous _Mountain Echo_, while the _Diogenes Lantern_, PUC's current [yearbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yearbook), was first published in 1938.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:4-5)
With the United States' entry into [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II), over 400 male students and [alumni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alumni) were eventually [drafted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription) into military service.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:4-5)
**Other history (1943–2023)**
In 2006 the faculty, administration, and Board of Trustees underscored PUC's commitment to undergraduate education by making a formal decision to remain a college and not change its name to university, as other small private colleges had done.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-reaccred-16)
In 2006, PUC's Board of Trustees made plans to transform the area into an [ecovillage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecovillage) of several hundred settlements, in partnership with Triad Development, a [Seattle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle)-based construction firm.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-17) Although the college downscaled its original plans due to community opposition – primarily by **Save Rural Angwin**, a local [NIMBY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY) group – the board voted in October 2010 to sever its contract with Triad and cancel the project.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:1-19)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-chronicle-20)
Pacific Union College has had a total of [twenty-four presidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_Pacific_Union_College). The first eight of these served while the school was still in Healdsburg. In 1983, Malcolm Maxwell became the first alumnus to lead PUC, serving for a record 18 years. Ralph Trecartin, the current president, took office in July 2021 after serving as the associate provost and dean of the College of Professionals for [Andrews University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrews_University).[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-21)

Academics
Pacific Union College is the only four-year college located in [Napa County, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa_County,_California).[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-22) It offers around 60 undergraduate majors in various fields, along with other types of programs. [Health science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_science), [business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business), and [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education) are the leading fields in which students seek out degrees, and their degree programs are [accredited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmatic_Accreditation) by their [respective accreditation bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#accreditation).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:6-6)
**Curriculum**
Pacific Union College offers 44 [bachelor's degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree) programs, 10 [associate degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associate_degree) programs, and three [master's degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%27s_degree) programs, in addition to minors, credential programs, pre-professional tracks, and an honors program.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:0-23) These are all organized throughout 25 academic departments.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:3-7) The school operates on a quarter-based academic calendar.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:13-24)
Though the range of its offerings is quite broad, PUC's most prominent programs are those in the [health sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_health_sciences), which are sought out by a considerable number of those who attend. In the 2020–2021 school year, two-thirds of all undergraduate degrees awarded were in the medical field, and 96% of the associate's degrees awarded were for nursing.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:6-6)
PUC maintains an especially close connection to [Loma Linda University School of Medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loma_Linda_University_School_of_Medicine), another Adventist institution, and most of the college's pre-professional programs are meant specifically for admission into Loma Linda.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:3-7) The college has sent a steady stream of students to the university for several decades; visiting from Loma Linda in 1925, [John H. Kellogg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harvey_Kellogg) noted that PUC was ""the college that sends the largest number of medical students from any one place.""[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-25) Degrees in business and education follow behind as the second two most sought-after.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:6-6)
Similar to its emphasis on [manual labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_labour) and [physical health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_health) in its Healdsburg days, PUC necessitates that students takes fitness classes as part of its general education requirements.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:3-7) Offerings in the past have included [fencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing), [trikke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trikke), [pickleball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickleball), [swimming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)), [water aerobics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_aerobics), [polo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo), [canoeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canoeing), [skiing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skiing), [snowboarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowboarding), [soccer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soccer), [dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance), and [yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga), though some of these have since been discontinued.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-26)
Similar to other Adventist schools, PUC offers study-abroad programs through **Adventist Colleges Abroad** (**ACA**), primarily in Europe and Latin America.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-27)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-28) Most of these programs were designed for those seeking degrees from the college's World Languages Department, though non-language majors often study abroad through the ACA as well.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-29)[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-30) PUC also organizes [mission trips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-term_mission) independently of ACA.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-31)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-32)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-33)
**Rankings**
At the start of the 2023–2024, the _[U.S. News & World Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._News_%26_World_Report)_ ranked Pacific Union College the 13th best regional college in the [Western United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_United_States), the 12th top performer in [social mobility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_mobility) (a position in shares with the [Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_Institute_of_Design_%26_Merchandising)), and the second Best Value School.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:13-24) In the same year, the _[New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times)_ ranked PUC the 8th most economically diverse college in the U.S. [Niche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niche_(company)) gives the college an overall B− score, and ranks it the 24th most diverse college in California, with its diversity graded A+. It also ranks PUC as the 14th best nursing college in California.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-34)
In 2024, _[Washington Monthly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Monthly)_ ranked Pacific Union College 35th among 223 colleges that award almost exclusively bachelor's degrees in the U.S. based on its contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service. [[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-35)
**Accreditation**
Pacific Union College has been [accredited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education_accreditation_in_the_United_States) by the [WASC Senior College and University Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WASC_Senior_College_and_University_Commission) or its predecessor since 1951.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-36) In February 2020, however, the commission issued a formal Notice of Concern regarding the college's accreditation, citing PUC's dwindling financial resources and dramatic drops in enrollment as areas that needed improvement.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-37) Though in the years following PUC noted moderate increases in enrollment and dismissed a number of its employees in response to WSCUC's recommendations, the commission has not withdrawn its Notice of Concern.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-38)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-39)[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-40) PUC is also accredited by the Adventist Church's own [Adventist Accrediting Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventist_Accrediting_Association).[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-41)[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-42)
In addition to these two institution-wide accreditations, many of PUC's programs and departments are accredited or approved by their respective programmatic accreditation bodies, including:
- [National Association of Schools of Art and Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Schools_of_Art_and_Design)[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-43)

Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush)'s presidential visit to the Napa Valley in 2006.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-60) The airport also supports PUC's Bachelor of Science degree in aviation and offers ground schools and flight instruction to the community.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-61)
**PUC Forest**
Much of the school's undeveloped acreage is managed as the **PUC** **Demonstration & Experimental Forest**, though on campus it has sometimes been called the **Back 40**.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:2-50) The forest was part of the [Angwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angwin,_California) property and a site of lumber before it was bought by the college. It spans roughly 1,600 acres (6.5 km2). In addition to providing the resources necessary for the expansion of the campus in its early years, the forest has also served as a site for biological research and preservation, enclosing as it does unique [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species) and [biodiversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity).[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:2-50)[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:12-62)
In 2018, PUC partnered with the [Napa County Land Trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa_County,_California#Agricultural_preservation) to preserve the forest as a [conservation easement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_easement); the easement is currently held by [CalFire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Department_of_Forestry_and_Fire_Protection).[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:2-50)[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:12-62) Covering 864 acres (3.50 km2), the easement protects about half of college's total property. It was valued at $7.1 million, much of it due to [vineyard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vineyard) potential.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:12-62) Attempts in the past have been made to develop or sell the land, however; most notably, the college made plans to transform the area into an [ecovillage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecovillage) in 2006, but it ultimately chose to cancel the project.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:1-19)
Still, with a network of hiking trails spanning 35 miles, the forest sees regular use. In 2019, the college partnered with Napa County's Open Space District to open its trail network to the public.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-63)[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-64) The forest is also a section along the [Bay Area Ridge Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Ridge_Trail), and was linked in the same year.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-65)[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-66) The [2009 Tour of California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Tour_of_California), an cycling race held within the state, raced through PUC.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-67)

PUC also maintains a [DEI Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity,_equity,_and_inclusion) as well as a [Title IX Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX).[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-73) It accepts the WSCUC criteria for diversity: [race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans)), [ethnicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity), [socioeconomic class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_class), [gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender), [age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing), [religious belief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_belief), [sexual orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation) and [disability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability).[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-diversity-74)
**Student association**
The **Pacific Union College [Student Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students%27_union)** (**PUCSA**) was started in 1887, just five years after the college was founded.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)_] It consists of an executive branch and a Student Senate. PUCSA funds publication of the school's student-run newspaper, the _Campus Chronicle,_ and the college yearbook, the _Diogenes Lantern_.

The logo of Gay and Straight People (GASP) in the early 2020s.**Gay and Straight People**
A [gay-straight alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay-straight_alliance), **Gay and Straight People** (**GASP**), has operated on campus since October 2008. It was first organized by a pre-med student named Jonathan Heldt, who established the alliance when he was a senior in the hopes of creating a [support group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_group) for [LGBTQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT) students and their [allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_ally).[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:7-75) Originally intending to form an official club, Heldt's proposal was rejected by PUC's Advisory Council.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-spectrummagazine.org-76)
Students and faculty continue to meet regularly to discuss LGBTQ issues.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-spectrummagazine.org-76)[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-77) Though the club remains formally unrecognized by the college, the group contributed to the expansion of [all-gender bathrooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unisex_public_toilet) on campus, and has had presence at the college's student orientation and club fairs.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:5-78)[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:7-75) In December 2022, the Student Senate passed a bill calling for GASP's recognition as an official club, though it has yet to be addressed by administration.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-:5-78)[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Union_College#cite_note-79)

Werner\n\nPersonal Information:\n- Full Name: Karl Francis Werner\n- Date of Birth: May 12, 1952\n- Place of Residence: Vacaville, California\n- Criminal Classification: Serial Killer\n\nCriminal Profile:\nKarl F. Werner was a serial killer active in Santa Clara County, Northern California, during a period from 1969 to 1971. He was convicted of murdering at least three teenage girls during this timeframe.\n\nVictims and Crimes:\nWerner's known victims included multiple teenage girls. One notable victim was Kathy Bilek, who was brutally stabbed 17 times in the back and 32 times in her chest and stomach. A maintenance worker at the crime scene recognized Werner, describing him as \""a little odd\"".\n\nZodiac Killer Connection:\nInterestingly, there was some initial confusion surrounding Werner's crimes. San Francisco police Inspector Dave Toschi initially suspected the Zodiac Killer might have been responsible for some of Werner's murders. The Zodiac Killer was reportedly driven to claim the Bilek murder from Werner, having previously laid claim to Werner's other two victims.\n\nLegal Outcome:\nWerner was ultimately convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. At the time of his conviction, he was confirmed to have killed at least three victims between 1969 and 1971.\n\nCurrent Status:\nAs of the available information, Werner was incarcerated at the California Medical Facility.\n\nSources:""}","recaz1wgcaqz0EFiQ,recO5mW1mFKtK0hCE,recioUzi4gjitPDzS,recT4sMRyAv9Sk1zs,recioUzi4gjitPDzS","{""label"": ""Sq.

Virginia Lee Jensen, local artist and teacher, passed away peacefully Friday afternoon after a brief illness.
With a BA in art/history, Virginia”s passion for art and education carried her through life, serving as a substitute teacher for the Oakland and Vallejo school districts.
She was an avid artist who loved to travel to the Monterey Coast where many of her beautiful seascapes were created.
Originally from Council Bluffs, Iowa, Virginia Lee Blenderman was preceded in death by her parents, Louis and Avis Blenderman; husband, Lt. Col. Verne M. Jensen; and daughter, Betty Lou Jensen. She is survived by her daughter, Melodie L. (Joe T.) Long and granddaughter, Denise (Gary) Shiner, and four great-grandchildren. She will be dearly missed.
The family is very grateful to his caregivers at Angels Crest Home for their wonderful compassionate care and the Sutter Solano Hospice Nurses.
Graveside services will be held Thursday at 2 p.m. at Skyview Memorial Lawn Cemetery.
In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Humane Society.

Arrangements under the direction of Colonial Chapels, Vallejo.

_By Donn Kraemer and Bill Harris_
_The Oredigger – Colorado School of Mines, Vol. 50, No. 13 (Dec. 15, 1969)_ 

Somewhere in San Francisco an unknown killer possibly plans his next murder, while in Golden a CSM professor works to thwart and expose him.

Professor Donald C. B. Marsh of the Mines math department is currently working on the ciphers sent by the killer, “Zodiac.” In these messages Zodiac tells of his past murders and reportedly gives his name.

Marsh is currently president of the American Cryptogram Association and has been a member for almost twenty years. Since 1960 he has been the editor of the foreign cipher section of the association’s journal.

Will Stevens, a staff writer for the _San Francisco Examiner_, called Dr. Marsh into the Zodiac case last August. Stevens had received Marsh’s name from Farago, author of the book _The Broken Seal_, the story of the cracking of the Japanese codes before World War II.

In briefing Marsh on the killings that had occurred near Vallejo, California, on December 20, 1968, and July 4, 1969, Stevens disclosed that “an individual purporting to be the killer had sent letters accompanied by ciphers to three of the area’s newspapers.” Marsh agreed to help in solving the ciphers, and was able to extract the message from the copies of the code sent to him.

Zodiac apparently enjoys reading news of himself, as he sends to the news media coded messages in which he says lie the clues to his identity and future murders.

And Zodiac said, _“W A → DRF?”_

According to Marsh, some parts of the Zodiac’s messages betray the man as an amateur, while other parts show that the man has some sophisticated knowledge of cryptography. One point of note is the fact that he changes the key, which shows some knowledge of ciphers. However, an educated cryptographer, in drafting a message, would probably use a numerical rather than a symbolic code (such as the one the Zodiac uses), thus giving the ciphers more flexibility in their encoding.

Marsh said, “In my opinion, some errors in the encipherment, as well as in the use of the various symbols rather than simple letters or numbers, indicate that the Zodiac… is not an experienced cryptographer. Each symbol represents a unique letter of the alphabet, but nearly every letter… was assigned more than one symbolic equivalent. These multiple substitutes and the omission of word spaces make the ciphers more difficult than the simple substitution ciphers found in many newspapers and puzzle magazines, but it would not require an expert to devise either of these complications.”

The ciphers consisted of various geometric symbols and alphabet letters, some reversed and inverted, printed in 8” × 17” rectangular arrays. According to Marsh, “the three portions incorporated the same symbols, indicating the likelihood that the same method of encipherment was used in each case.”

The three portions, when deciphered, seemed to make up a single rather wild message, in which the killer did not reveal his name as he had previously promised (“In this cipher is my identity.”).

Marsh also related fears by many people involved that the current Sharon Tate murder case will sting Zodiac’s ego, prompting him to commit more murders.

Anxiously meeting the challenge of decoding the messages, Dr. Marsh is currently working on the latest of Zodiac’s cryptograms. He has issued a challenge to the killer, saying that he can decipher the message despite the Zodiac’s efforts to outwit him. Until that time, though, the killer’s identity and future plans may possibly remain as much of an “unsolved puzzle” as they are now.

Russell was a man with an enthusiastic and positive view of life that was contagious to those around him. He was a dedicated police officer and retired from the Solano County Sheriff’s Office in 1976 after 16 years of duty. He enjoyed a long and happy retirement that included golfing, singing, playing the drums and piano, flying his son-in-law’s airplane and making friends wherever he went. Most recently he appeared as a technical consultant on the Director’s Cut of the Zodiac movie discussing his involvement in the case.
He is survived by his wife of 65 years, Hope Butterbach; daughters Sharon Downey, Karen Eckerson and Debra McClanahan; son-in-law, Dean Eckerson; grandchildren Tracy Porten, Russell Miller, Mark Downey and Andrew Dussell; and great-grandchildren Theodore and Contessa Porten, Ethan Dussell, and Riley Miller.

Passed away Dec. 29, 2003 while traveling in Mexico. One of the first diabetic children to be saved by the discovery of Insulin in 1921, Dave managed his disease well and lived for 84 years without serious complications. Graduated from UC Berkeley in 1941 with a BS in Criminology, then settled in Sacramento with his wife Virginia (Fryklund), who later passed on in 1980. Served 29 years as a Criminalist and ballistics expert for the Calif. Dept. of Justice and later for the Sacramento District Attorneys office until retirement. Performed scientific analysis of evidence in criminal and civil cases, conducted field investigations, and served as an expert witness before state and federal courts. Authored many technical articles in his field. Instructor on physical evidence and arson investigation for CHP, Sheriff and Police Academys, and State Fire Academy. 

Lifelong interest in Fire Services led to 18 years service as a volunteer firefighter and 11 years as Director of the Arden Fire District. Daves love of hiking, nature, travel and photography inspired many family camping trips and 45 foreign trips often captured in his photographs. He is survived by Marian Washburn; brother, John Burd; daughters, Carroll Wunsch and Cindy Long (and husband Jim); grandsons, Ryan and Tyler Wunsch; Marians daughter, Wynne Gill and son, Court Washburn; and many family members and friends. An informal gathering will be held on Saturday, January 31, 1:00-3:00 at 4820 Concho Court in Sacramento. Memorial donations may be made to the American Diabetes Assoc. to aid in research for a cure for diabetes.
