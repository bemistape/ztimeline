They had their 1959 pick-up truck, Red in color, with wood side-boards, parked inside the field of the Marshall Ranch.
In this interview it was learned that they were hunting in the area from 9:00PM to 11:00PM. 11:00PM was approximate, because [redacted] looked at his watch and he knew it was in the area of 11:00PM. It could have been five minutes to the hour or ten minutes to. It took them three or four minutes, possibly five minutes to get back to their truck, walking up the road on the

They claimed that they left the area several minutes after [redacted], who established the time as 11:20, that they left the scene. They described the light colored 1960 Rambler S/W that was parked at the gate. It was parked Southwest of where we finally found the car. This discrepancy wasn't noted at first.

They sat around awhile and didn't leave until several hours later. They arrived in the area of the pump station around 9:00PM. They parked the car about 25 feet inside of the Marshall Ranch property off of the road. They walked the creek towards the pump station. They had the dogs loose and they treed either a cat or a racoon in the area of the Dotta Ranch.

a long barrell .22 revolver. [partially illegible]
[redacted] remembers looking at his watch around 11:00 PM or five or ten minutes before and they headed back towards the car. He said it took them about 10 minutes to walk back to the truck. He was at the truck about a total of 5 minutes and a car came in, that has been identified as MRS [redacted]'S, it drove in, turned around and drove back in the opposite direction towards Benicia, again. He states that approximately 5 minutes later they drove in his truck a '59 Chevrolet, red in color, with white wood sideboards, cattle guards, on the sides. They drove this truck back to the Gasser Ranch heading towards Benicia and they passed the car. [redacted] insists that the Rambler was parked on the bank. That would be on the South side. He did not see any person in the car. He estimates he left the area between 11:00 and 11:15PM. He remained at the Gasser's house about an hour and then left out through Highway #21, through the Jamison Canyon and headed home, arriving about 12:30AM.

[redacted] was asked if he had a rifle. He stated that he had a automatic rifle. The RO advised [redacted] of his constitutional rights at this time. Due to the fact that he was in the area and he did have a rifle which he claimed he

had with him that night. He was given a receipt for the rifle. The rifle was tested at the S/O by Rangemaster George Parks. On the basis of the findings of George Parks this rifle has been eliminated as a suspected weapon. [redacted] states that FRANK GASSER does own an automatic rifle but that he doesn't have it at the house. He suggested that we call or see a gentleman by the name of HARLAN [redacted] who lives at 106 Marquis Avenue. It is possible that the gun is there, because GASSER does not leave his guns at the ranch because of recent thefts. [redacted]'s car has California license D-26024.

The female victim was identified as Betty Lou Jensen, 16 years of age, residing at 123 Ridgewood Court, Vallejo, California.
The female victim was lying 28 feet north from the rear of the Rambler, lying on her right side with her head to the west. Examination of the victim revealed five (5) small caliber gunshot wounds in her back. These wounds appeared to have been inflicted by a small caliber pistol, as no exit wounds were apparent.
The male victim was found beside the right front door of the Rambler. Examination revealed a gunshot wound located behind the left ear. The bullet was not visible. Examination of the Rambler revealed that the right front door was open.
A check of the area was made in regards to a weapon, which proved negative.
(Cont’d – Page #2)
The interior of the above vehicle was such that the right front door was standing open and the other three doors closed and locked. The front seat back had been let down into a reclining position. The right rear window had a hole which appeared to have been made by a bullet, with the entire glass shattered, and there was found a hole to the rear of the left rear wheel housing, which appeared to have been made by a bullet.
The scene was then photographed, the entire scene and all evidence found by the reporting officers, along with the photos, was turned over to Solano County Coroner Horn and Sergeant Lunblad, Solano County Sheriff’s Office, for proper disposition.
There was no disturbance of the crime scene except the removal of Victim #2, and prior to his removal a chalk outline of his body was made by Officer Warner.

REFERENCE: JENSEN: Betty Lou (V)/FARADAY: David (V) 

RECEIVED FROM: SGT. LESLIE LUNDBLAD 
DATE: 1-3-69 
TIME: 10:15 AM 

The following exhibits were submitted:
1. Bullet from Faraday's body. 
2. 
3. Two bullets from Jensen's body. 
4. 
5. Bullet found in panties of Jensen. 
6. 
7. Five Super X .22 cartridge cases found at scene by coroner. 
8. 
9. Four Super X .22 cartridge cases found at scene by Sgt. Silva. 
10. 
11. One bullet found on top of 1961 Rambler, Lic DTL 962. 
12. 
13. One bullet found in floor mat, left side storage area of 1961 Rambler, Lic DTL 962. 
14. 
15. One bullet found on ground near Jensen's body. 
16. 
17. Purple dress of Jensen. 
18. 
FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS:
Examinations have been conducted of all bullets and cartridge cases present in Items 1 thru 8. Various markings on those exhibits were extensively examined, evaluated and checked against records maintained by this laboratory and our rather large test bullet and cartridge file. As a result of these studies we find that the exhibits correspond only with tests fired in J. C. Higgins, Model 80, .22 automatic rifles. It should not be assumed that the exhibits must have been fired in such a weapon but this is the only type presently in our files which corresponds, therefore, it appears somewhat probable that the responsible weapon was of this type. 

In addition to subjecting to further tests any J. C. Higgins, Model 80 automatic recovered, further tests should be made on any weapons having the following characteristics: 

a. Cartridge cases: Semi-circular firing pin impression at 12 o'clock position, small extractor markings at 3 o'clock position. Very faint ejector marking at 8 o'clock position (latter may not always be detectable). 

b. Weapon barrel or test bullets: Six right hand grooves, land and groove ratio 1:1+. Bullet groove width approximately .056 inch. Bullet land width approximately .060 inch. 

Intercomparison of the cartridge cases in Items 4 and 5 indicates that all were probably fired in the same weapon and all are the same make and type of ammunition. Due to lack of sufficient unique structure it appears that considerable difficulty will be encountered in positively identifying the responsible weapon if it should be recovered. 

All bullets submitted were Western copper coated .22 Long Rifle bullets. Although some were damaged it was possible to determine that all but Item 1 contained the same (6 RH) class characteristics. The best bullets were those in Items 2, 3 and 8. Each of these was microscopically compared with the others but in no case was an absolutely positive identification possible. This is apparently due to the condition of the rifle barrel, which does not leave course structure on bullets fired therein, as well as the effect of the copper coating on the bullet. From our examination it appears that a conclusive identification of the responsible weapon will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, even though it should be recovered. 

Examination of the dress (Item 9) revealed one hole in the front near the center and five holes on the upper right side of the back. No smoke or gunpowder residue was found in the vicinity of any of these holes except the topmost hole on the back. Near the latter one single grain of gunpowder was found. From these examinations, it therefore appears that the weapon was held at least several feet from the victim at the time of the shooting. The minimum distance it could have been held cannot be established without testing of the responsible weapon when it is recovered. The one single granule of gunpowder found near the topmost hole on the back of the dress may have been transferred by the bullet itself. If not, it would appear that when this hole was produced the weapon was somewhat closer to the victim than in the case of the other holes. 

DISPOSITION OF THE EVIDENCE:
The exhibits submitted will be retained at the laboratory pending receipt of further instructions.

This attack, occurring around 11:15 PM, would later be recognized as the first confirmed murders committed by the unidentified serial killer known as the Zodiac.\n\n## The Attack\n\nThe young couple was on their first date. After visiting the Jensen home around 8:00 PM, they had planned to attend a Christmas concert at Hogan High School followed by a party. Instead, they drove to the remote Lake Herman Road turnout, a known lovers' lane.\n\nAccording to police reports, the killer apparently pulled up either beside or behind the couple's 1961 Rambler station wagon. David Faraday was shot once at close range behind his left ear while still inside or just exiting the vehicle. Betty Lou Jensen attempted to flee, making it approximately 28 feet from the car before being shot five times in the back in a tight pattern. The murder weapon was determined to be a .22 caliber semi-automatic pistol or rifle.\n\n## Investigation Details\n\nSeveral witnesses reported seeing the victims' car and possibly another vehicle at the turnout that night. Stella Medeiros discovered the bodies around 11:15 PM and flagged down Benicia Police Captain Daniel Pitta and Officer William Warner. Despite finding nine .22 caliber shell casings at the scene, investigators were unable to locate the murder weapon.\n\nBallistics analysis by the California Department of Justice indicated the murder weapon was likely a J.C. Higgins Model 80 .22 caliber semi-automatic rifle or similar firearm with six right-hand grooves. The lack of gunpowder residue on Jensen's clothing (except for a single grain) suggested the shooter fired from at least several feet away.\n\n## Significance in the Zodiac Case\n\nWhile initially investigated as an isolated incident, these murders would later be claimed by the Zodiac Killer in his July 31, 1969 letters to Bay Area newspapers. The Lake Herman Road murders established the pattern of attacking couples in isolated areas that would characterize the Zodiac's early crimes.\n\nThe case remains officially unsolved. Despite numerous suspects being investigated over the decades, no one has been conclusively identified as the perpetrator of these murders or the other Zodiac crimes.""}","{""isStale"": true, ""state"": ""empty"", ""value"": null}",2026-02-16T21:16:09.000Z,true,Lake Herman Road Zodiac Site,lake-herman-road-double-murder,1,recgJKENPX5dM7i8f,69938919adc6b37020503f98,,

RO went to location and contacted shooting victim, Michael Mageau. Was advised by Dr. Scott that RO could talk to him for a short time, however he was under medication at this time and would possibly be going to sleep shortly. RO contacted Michael who still was in very bad condition and was very strained to talk as he had had a wound in his mouth. RO asked him if he could as best as possible relate the facts as he knew them as to the occurrences of Friday night when he and D. FERRIN were shot. Michael states that he would do his best to give a statement and gave it as following.
States that at approximately 4:00p.m. Friday afternoon, that D. Ferrin called him up, and in their conversation stated they agreed that they would go to a movie in San Francisco that night and she would be at the house at approximately 7:30 p.m. Michael states he next heard from her at approximately 8:00p.m. when she again called and stated that she had to go with her sister, Christine, to the Miss Firecracker contest, that she would call him as soon as she could, as soon as she was clear from this. Michael states that he stayed home and at approx. 10:30 he received another call from Dea stating she would be over shortly. He stated that Dea came over at approximately 11:30 or shortly thereafter and picked him up in her car. They were both hungry as they had not had supper and were going to go get something to eat. Stated that she was driving her vehicle, the Corvair they were found in. Stated they drove west on Springs Road and as they were driving down Springs Road to go get something to eat, Dea stated to him that she wanted to talk to him about something. Michael stated that approximately at the location of Mr. Ed's on Springs Road they turned around and headed east at his suggestion to go to Blue Rock Springs Park where they could talk. They went directly out to this location, pulled the car in the parking lot where it was found by the police. Dea turned the lights and the motor off and had the radio playing. States they were there just a very short time, a few minutes, and three cars pulled in to the parking lot where they were. They were apparently young kids, and they heard some laughing and carrying on and a few firecrackers were set off, then the three vehicles left within a short time. This was just a very short space of time, a few minutes. Shortly after this and about five minutes before the shooting occurred, Michael states a vehicle pulled into the lot, coming from the direction of Springs Road and Vallejo. The driver turned the lights off on the car and pulled around to the left or east side of their car, approximately six or eight feet away and sat there for a minute. Michael states he asked Ded if she knew who it was and she stated, ""Oh, never mind."" Michael stated at this time he is always kidding Dea about knowing so many people and does not know whether she meant this as she knew the fellow or not. Michael states as best as he can recall, he could not see the car too clearly, however the shape of the car looked similar to the car that Dea owns, a Corvair. He could not see the color or anything as it was very dark out there.

States as far as he could tell this car had one male subject in it. The car then drove off and headed in the direction of Vallejo & Springs Road at a fairly fast rate of speed. He stated approximately five minutes later, the vehicle pulled up, coming from the direction of Vallejo & Springs Road. This vehicle pulled up approximately ten feet behind and to the right side of Dea's car, which would be the side that Michael was sitting. The vehicle's lights were left on and the subject got out and walked toward the car. He had a large high-powered flashlight, the kind you carry with a handle. This subject walked up to the car and Michael stated that both he and Dea believed that it was a policeman and that he wanted to check their I.D. or something. Stated subject stepped up to Michael's side of the car, which is the right side, shining the flashlight on them. Subject did not say anything to them, nor did they say anything to him. Michael stated he started to reach for his wallet as he felt it was a policeman who wanted to see his I.D. States as he did so, he heard a muffled sound and felt a pain in his back and his neck area. He states he heard some more muffled sounds, sounding like a gun with a silencer on it, and felt pains in his body, his back and around his neck. States he tried to climb over the back seat to get away from the shooting and subject kept shooting him again and again. States finally the subject quit shooting him and apparently turned the gun on Dea and started shooting her again and again. States subject then turned around and started to walk back to his vehicle which still had the headlights on. Michael stated he could not tell if he meant to yell at the subject or if he just yelled from pain, but he let out some type of yell. At this time, the subject apparently hearing him, came back to the car and shot Michael two more times, once in the back and once in the left leg. States the subject then turned the gun on Dea and shot her twice more. Michael states that all the shots that he heard were muffled, sounding similar to a gun with the silencer on. It was not loud. States the subject then turned around and casually walked back to his vehicle and got in. Michael at this time stated that he had to reach outside the car door to open it as the handle inside was broken. Stated he reached outside and opened the car door and fell outside on the ground. As he fell out onto the ground the vehicle the subject was in backed up in a turning movement and then took off toward Springs Road in Vallejo at a very high rate of speed. Michael states as the vehicle drove off he only saw the rear portion of it, this rear part appearing to be a vehicle similar to or the same type as Dea's car, a Corvair. Also a very similar color, possibly a little bit lighter brown. It had a California license, however he could not tell what the numbers were. Stated the subject continued on Blue Rock Springs Road at a very high rate of speed towards Springs Road in Vallejo.
Michael states that in what seemed to be eight to ten minutes after this a car came by with three young hippy types in it. He can recall two boys and one girl. States he waved and yelled to the occupants of this vehicle to come over and help him. Stated they came close to him

and he asked them to get a doctor quick. Stated the girl told him to lie still and they would get a doctor. States approximately five to ten minutes later the police arrived in a vehicle that was not a black and white police car and other policemen arrived, and he was then taken to the hospital.
RO asked Michael if he could give a description of the responsible subject, and he stated as best as he could recall the description is as follows. Subject appeared to be short, possibly 5'8"", was real heavy set, beefy build. States subject was not blubbery fat, but real beefy, possibly 195 to 200, or maybe even larger. Stated he had short curly hair, light brown, almost blond. He was wearing a short-sleeved shirt, blue in color. Cannot remember if it was light or dark blue. States he just saw subject's face from the profile, side view, and does not recall seeing a front view. States there was nothing unusual about his face, other than it appeared to be large. Michael stated the subject did not have a mustache, nor was he wearing glasses or anything. He could not recall anything unusual except that he had a large face. Michael reemphasized that he really did not get a good look at subject other than his profile. Also, it was dark out and it was hard to see the subject.
Michael states that he could possibly recognize responsible if he had a profile view, as this is the best view he had of the subject. Stated subject was a white male, approximately 26-30 years. Was unable to judge real well what his age was. States he feels sure the subject wanted to make sure that they were dead. This due to the fact that he returned and shot each one of them twice again after the first shooting.
When questioned about Dea's vehicle having the headlights on when the police arrived, Michael was unable to explain fully, however states he recalls something about possibly flashing the lights on and off to attract attention of passing vehicles. States he cannot remember if he did this or possibly Dea did it. States while still in the car he called to Dea, does not recall what he said, but recalls the only thing that she was able to do was make a small moaning sound. She was unable to say anything.
RO questioned Michael as to a possible motive, if he had had any argument or trouble, etc. with anyone recently, or if there was any reason at all that anyone would want to harm him. He stated he could not recall anything at all, having any arguments or anything to give anyone reason to do anything like this. Also st1ated that Darlene did not say anything about any trouble that she has had. States they have always been very truthful with each other and confided very closely in each other's problems and he is sure if she had known about someone after her or had a hate for her enough to do something like this, she would have said something about it. States as far as he knows, the only type of trouble that Dea has had was sometimes her friends got mad at her. There were sometimes petty jealousies between her and her friends.

Sometimes some possibly boyfriends, not exactly dating type boyfriends, but friends, just acquaintances, would become jealous over just petty incidents.
The interview of Michael MAGEAU was terminated by RO at this time as he was becoming very tired due to the medication and also his condition due to the gunshot wounds. RO wishes to emphasize that throughout the entire interview with Michael it was a very strained situation for him as he had been given a sedative type of medication to relax him and put him to sleep and he was straining to keep himself awake in order to give the information to RO. RO advised him to rest at this time and when he woke up if he felt better and if he felt he possibly could give more information to have the nurse call RO at the police department. (Rust)

After this was over, at about 11pm, they decided to look for this girl that Roger knows. They drove around town and did not see her and decided to go to Blue Rock Park to look for her. They went out the freeway to Columbus Parkway and came in to the Park the back way. While they were driving in toward the Park neither boy recalls seeing any vehicle coming out, none parked along the road, nor did they pass any vehicle. When they came to the park area it was dark and they looked for any vehicles. The only one they saw was the victims brown Corvair, same was parked in location as found by the police. They stated that when first observed the Corvair did not have any lites on. Debbie stopped the car in the road and they were trying to decide to go check the vehicle to see if Roger's girl was in it when the lites came on. They thought the occupants were going to leave and then thought they heard someone scream. Debbie backed up her car and turned to shine her high beams onto the car and then they saw a male subject on the ground beside the passenger side of the Corvair, door was open. The male was rolling around on the ground and screaming. Debbie then pulled her car up behind the Corvair and Jerry jumped out and ran up to the male and asked ""are you all right?"" and the male said ""I'm shot and the girl's shot, get a doc."" Jerry said ""All right we'll get one"", and the male said ""hurry"". Roger had jumped out of the car also and heard this talk. Neither of them looked in the Corvair and didn't see the girl. Then Jerry wanted to stay there while Debra and Roger went to get a doctor, but they insisted he come with them.

Mexico, stayed a few weeks and then returned to San Francisco. Stated Darlene came to visit him and spent a weekend after he came back but that both decided there was nothing to keep them together. He wandered around the country after this, working short periods of time at different jobs and being a part of the ""social revolution"" as portrayed by the hip generation.

Stated on July 4, 1969, he recalls going with his wife to a hippy encampment at Boulder Creek and listening to music. Spent the evening at home. They had no transportation at this time as their old truck was inoperative. Insists that he had no knowledge of his ex-wife's death until this date. Stated he had read of the Zodiac but did not connect what he had read as he did not know Darlene had remarried and did not know her name was Ferrin. Phillips had in his possession a photostatic copy of his birth certificate showing he was born in L.A. May 8, 1944. His father was named Crabtree and his mother named Thelma [redacted].

VALLEJO POLICE DEPARTMENT
NARRATIVE CONTINUATION
Case No. 243146

Reference:
Michael Renault MAGEAU
WM, 102949
[Address redacted]

081691

Pursuant to a previous telephone conversation with Michael MAGEAU, I made arrangements with him to meet at the Ontario Airport in San Bernardino County. These arrangements were made for him and I to meet in front of the security office in this airport at 10:30 a.m. on 081691. I flew to Ontario Airport, arriving shortly after 10:00 a.m. I met MAGEAU promptly at 10:30 a.m. in front of the security office. MAGEAU was accompanied by an older white female that I would estimate to be in early 60’s. MAGEAU explained that he lived with this female and her husband in the residence in [redacted].

It should be noted at this time that MAGEAU was the surviving person in the Zodiac Killing which occurred on 070469. I briefly asked MAGEAU about the incident. MAGEAU indicated that he did, in fact, get a view of the responsible’s face. It was a very short duration of time as the responsible had shined a flashlight into his face and almost immediately began shooting him. He then switched the flashlight over to the area where the other person in the vehicle with him, Darlene FERRIN, was seated, and began shooting her. MAGEAU indicated that it was during this span of time that he was able to see the individual who had shot him.



PAGE 2 OF 5

I advised MAGEAU that I had a group of photographs which I wished to show him, and that the responsible who shot him on July 4, 1969 may or may not be amongst these photographs, and merely because I was showing him pictures, he did not have to identify anyone. MAGEAU indicated he understood this.

I showed MAGEAU a photographic lineup containing six photographs. The fourth photograph to the right in this lineup is that of Arthur Leigh ALLEN. MAGEAU viewed this lineup for approximately 15 or 20 seconds. He then placed his finger on the photograph of Arthur Leigh ALLEN stating, “That’s him.” I asked MAGEAU how sure he was, and he indicated he was pretty sure; that the responsible had a round face like that, and then he pointed to the picture on the right of another individual. The picture he was now pointing to was that of a person whom I could only read the first [redacted]. The lineup is made up primarily of soundex driver’s licenses which have been stapled together, and I do not want to further remove the staples from this lineup at this time to more positively identify this individual.

I asked MAGEAU if he was also identifying this photograph. He emphatically stated “No,” just that the picture also had a round face like that of the picture that he had identified of ALLEN. I asked MAGEAU on a scale of 1–10 how sure he was of his identification of the photograph of ALLEN. MAGEAU stated, “It’s at least an 8. I’m very sure that this is the individual who shot me on July 4, 1969.”



PAGE 3 OF 5

I then asked MAGEAU if he was shown any other photographs during the investigation of this case. MAGEAU indicated that shortly after the shooting, he was shown a number of photographs which he was unable to identify. He indicates that today is the first time he was shown a photograph wherein he was able to identify a responsible.

MAGEAU also indicated that 8–10 years ago when he was living in the City of Oxnard he was shown some photographs by the Oxnard Police Department and was unable to make an identification at that time. It should be noted that I was responsible for having Oxnard Police Department show a group of photographs to MAGEAU of a suspect that had been developed by the Department of Justice.

MAGEAU was asked if he had heard any of the recent publicity regarding the Zodiac Case. MAGEAU indicated that he had read in a newspaper that a suspect who was a disabled school teacher had been identified as a possible responsible in the Zodiac killings. MAGEAU indicated there was no picture with this article, and he has seen no TV coverage regarding the Zodiac Case recently.

MAGEAU indicates he has never seen the face of the individual he had identified today with the exception on July 4, 1969.



PAGE 4 OF 5

MAGEAU was then asked if he had ever attended in 1969, a painting party at Darlene FERRIN’S residence. MAGEAU indicated that he had not, but he had heard about this party. He was asked if he knew the name of Ron ALLEN. MAGEAU indicated that name sounded familiar, but he can’t remember for sure. He was then asked if he knew the name of Leigh ALLEN. MAGEAU responded, “I don’t think so.”

MAGEAU was then asked about a lengthy rap sheet which I had obtained from the Department of Justice on him; wherein, he had used approximately 33 aliases. MAGEAU viewed this listed aliases and indicated that he had, in fact, used most of those names. MAGEAU indicated that he had previously been in quite a bit of trouble; that he was now a Born Again Christian and that he attended the First Assembly of God Church as well as the First Baptist Church. And, in fact, the woman with him and her husband were both church members in both of these churches, and they all attended. He was presently residing with this woman and her husband and doing handyman work for them. My impression of MAGEAU at this time that he is sincere in his religious beliefs and has put his lawless past behind him.



PAGE 5 OF 5

MAGEAU indicated that he would cooperate with this investigation in any way possible. I indicated to MAGEAU that it may be necessary to fly him up to Northern California for a more in-depth interview. He indicated that he would have no objection to doing this. An appointment will be made with MAGEAU for a more in-depth interview.

**FOR NAPA SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DIALOGUE BETWEEN AN UNKNOWN ASSAILANT AND BRYAN HARTNELL**
**C:** What do you want?
**A:** Now take it easy - all I want's your money. There is nothing to worry about - all I want is your money.
**B:** O.K. - whatever you say. I want you to know now that I will cooperate so you don't have to worry - whatever you say we'll do. Do you want us to come up with our hands up or down?
**A:** Just don't make any fast moves - come up slowly.
**B:** But we don't have any money - all I have is 75¢.
**A:** That doesn't matter - every little bit helps (pause) - I'm on my way to Mexico - I escaped from Deer Lodge Prison in Montana, Deer Lodge. I need some money to get there.
**B:** You're welcome to the money I have, but isn't there something else I can do for you? Give you a check or get some more?
**A:** No.
**B:** I can give you my phone number and you can call me.
**A:** (No reply)
**B:** I want to get in contact with you. I am a sociology major and maybe I can even offer you more help than you think you need.
**A:** No.
**B:** Well, is there any other thing you need?
**A:** Yes. One more thing - I want your car keys. My car is hot.
**B:** (Reaching into pockets, then patting first front then back pockets) I guess in all the excitement I don't remember where I put them. Let's see. Are they in my shirt, in the ignition, on the blanket.... Say! Would you answer a question for me? I've always wondered. On T.V. movies and in an article in the Readers Digest they say that thieves really keep their guns loaded. Is yours?
**A:** (excited slightly) Yes, it is! (then calm and matter-of-fact) I killed a couple of men before.
**B:** What? I didn't hear you...
**A:** I killed a couple of guards getting out of prison. And I'm not afraid to kill again.
**C:** Bryan - do what he says!
**A:** Now I want the girl to tie you up.
**C:** (reaches for rope that he pulls from back pocket)
**B:** This is really strange. I wonder why someone hasn't thought of this before. I'll bet there's good money in it.
**A:** (no reply)
**B:** What was the name of that prison?
**A:** (no reply)
**B:** No really, what did you say the name of it was? I'm just curious.
**A:** (begrudgingly) Deer Lodge in Montana.
(There must have been some dialogue at this point but I can't remember any until we are both tied up)
**A:** Now I want you both to lay face down so I can tie up your feet.
**B:** Come on - we could be out here for a long time and it could get cold at night.
**A:** Come on - get down!
**B:** Listen, I didn't complain when you tied our hands, but this is ridiculous!
**A:** I told you....
**B:** We aren't going anywhere - Anyway, I don't think that it's necessary (or - Aw, Come On - we don't want to.)
**A:** (Pointing gun directly at me at point blank range) I told you to get down!
(He ties me, then her)
**B:** Your hands are shaking. Are you nervous?
**A:** Yes, I guess so. (laughed in a very relaxed manner)
**B:** Well, I suppose that I'd be nervous too.
(Then after we were tied and hog-tied)
**B:** Now that everything is all said and done, could you show me that your gun is loaded? (Or, and probably this: ""Now that all i11s said and done, was that gun really loaded?"")
**A:** Yes, it was! (or) Sure, I'll show you.
(He then opened cartridge or whatever)
(That was the last thing I remember him saying.)

B: No really, what did you say the name of it was? I'm just curious.
A: (begrudgingly) Deer Lodge in Montana.
(There must have been some dialogue at this point but I can't remember any until we are both tied up)
A: Now I want you both to lay face down so I can tie up your feet.
B: Come on - we could be out here for a long time and it could get cold at night.
A: Come on - get down!
B: Listen, I didn't complain when you tied our hands, but this is ridiculous!
A: I told you....
B: We aren't going anywhere - Anyway, I don't think that it's necessary (or - Aw, Come On - we don't want to.)
A: (Pointing gun directly at me at point blank range) I told you to get down!
(He ties me, then her)
B: Your hands are shaking. Are you nervous?
A: Yes, I guess so. (laughed in a very relaxed manner)
B: Well, I suppose that I'd be nervous too.
(Then after we were tied and hog-tied)
B: Now that everything is all said and done, could you show me that your gun is loaded? (Or, and probably this: ""Now that all i11s said and done, was that gun really loaded?"")
A: Yes, it was! (or) Sure, I'll show you.
(He then opened cartridge or whatever)
(That was the last thing I remember him saying.)

MR. BYRD advised that MISS JUDY was a student at the college and had left the college earlier in the afternoon, driving a yellow Datsun. At 2135 hours Reporting Officers put out an All Points Bulletin around the City and County of Napa for this above described vehicle. At 2137 hours Officers received permission to interview the victim BRYAN HARTNELL who was taken to the X-Ray Room for x-rays. Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Lonergan attempted to interview BRYAN HARTNELL while in the presence of DONALD JUDAH and hospital attendant CLIFFORD MEAGHER. Sgt. Narlow was called away to answer a phone before the interview got under way. HARTNELL appeared to be in extreme pain and also appeared to be in shock. Reporting Officer Lonergan introduced himself to HARTNELL and asked him to give us any information he had on his assailant. HARTNELL stated that the assailant was wearing a black ceremonial type hood, square on top, and appeared to be heavy-set, between 200 and 250 pounds. He also stated his assailant had approached both him and MISS SHEPARD with a gun but had stabbed them with a long knife. HARTNELL further stated the gun was in a black holster and the knife was in a sheath. He stated that the attacker was wearing dark clothing, dark jacket and dark pants. HARTNELL further stated that the gun was an automatic pistol and the knife had a black handle and appeared to be homemade.
It should be noted that HARTNELL was very groggy and he was very difficult to interview at that time. Subject was re-interviewed the next day by Det/Sgt. Robertson and gave more complete details. (The report of Sgt. Robertson's interview is attached.)
At 2215 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan left the Queen of the Valley Hospital after advising Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and William Munk to take charge of the clothing of the victims and any other evidence from the victims when it was released from the hospital. Munk and Brambrink were also advised to stand by at the hospital as a security measure until other arrangements could be made.
As Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan were arriving at the Napa County Sheriff's Office, they were advised by the Napa Police Department that they had located MISS JUDY in the downtown Napa area and were bringing her to the Napa County Sheriff's Office. MISS [JUDY] was interviewed by Lonergan and Narlow at the Napa County Sheriff's Office. She was further identified as MISS JUDITH, a student at Pacific Union College, with a permanent residence address of Sun Valley, California. MISS [JUDITH] advised that she was with BRYAN

HARTNELL and CECELIA SHEPARD earlier in the afternoon. She stated that they all left Pacific Union College together at approximately 1:00 P.M. and went to a rummage sale in the City of St. Helena. She stated that BRYAN had bought a T.V. set at the rummage sale and had to transport it back to his room at Pacific Union College. She stated he left CECELIA at the rummage sale as there was not enough room in his car. MISS [JUDITH] stated BRYAN returned to the St. Helena area and picked up CECELIA at approximately 2:00 P.M. MISS [JUDITH] stated as far as she knew, both BRYAN and CECELIA were planning to go to San Francisco when they left her in St. Helena. MISS [JUDITH] stated she had no knowledge of any plans that BRYAN and CECELIA were making to go to the Lake Berryessa area. MISS [JUDITH] stated the last time she saw BRYAN and CECELIA was approximately 2:00 P.M. in the afternoon.
The interview with MISS [JUDITH] was terminated at that point.
Det/Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow then proceeded to Lake Berryessa and arrived at the scene of the crime, which was approximately a mile and a half north of Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters, at 2354 hours. The scene was being preserved by uniformed officers and under the direct control of Deputy Sheriffs David Collins and Ray Land. The investigating officers were briefed by Officers Collins and Land as to what had taken place prior to our arrival. Officers observed a 1956 white Kharman Ghia with a black vinyl top, Oregon license plate 4 U 2040. Investigating officers were shown footprints in dirt area and tire tracks, both believed to have been left by responsible. Investigating officers awaited the arrival of Sgt. Tom Butler who had been called to take photographs of the crime scene area and Sgt. Hal Snook, criminalist for collection and preservation of physical evidence. R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were advised by Park Ranger Dennis Land who had also arrived at the scene that it was possible to get to the beach area by vehicle from a locked gate approximately one-half mile south of the victim's vehicle. Officers proceeded to the area and arrived at the footpath approximately halfway between the scene of the crime at the beach and the victim's vehicle on the road. At that point, after a brief examination of the footpath area, officers discovered a similar footprint on the footpath to that found at the scene of the victim's vehicle. At that point, due to the lateness and darkness of the hour, Reporting Officers decided to completely secure the area and make a thorough search of the scene at first light. Officers then exited the crime scene area in the same manner and locked the aforementioned gate leading to this vicinity. Investigating officers along with Park Ranger Dennis Land went to the Berryessa Park Headquarters.

took into his possession certain items belonging to the victims that were taken into evidence by Ranger Dennis Land. These items consisted of a blanket, a pair of man's shoes, a wallet belonging to BRYAN HARTNELL, eyeglasses, and playing cards. Among the various aforementioned items believed to belong to the victims, were numerous strands of white plastic line cut into various assorted lengths, some of which had what appeared to be bloodstains. These items were subsequently turned over to Det/Sgt. Hal Snook for preservation.
Assigned investigators then proceeded back to the scene where the victim's car was parked and assisted Sgt. Snook in the making of the plaster casts. At approximately 0245 hours Sgt. Lonergan, having previously obtained the keys to the vehicle from BRYAN HARTNELL's property at Queen of the Valley Hospital, drove the white Kharman Ghia to the maintenance shop at Berryessa Park Headquarters. The vehicle was parked inside of the maintenance shop building and the building was secured for the evening by investigating officers with the assistance of Park Ranger Dennis Land. Assigned Investigators then returned back to the scene where the victim's vehicle had been previously parked and awaited the arrival of Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and Mel Fechter who were assigned to security duty in the crime scene area. At approximately 0300 hours officers assumed their duties at the crime scene area and the security was placed under the direction of Deputy Allen Brambrink. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then returned to their respective residences with plans to continue the investigation at daybreak.
9/28/69 0700 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene at Lake Berryessa area, accompanied by Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Capt. Donald Townsend, and Sgt. James Munk. Officers then assisted Det/Sgt. Snook in tracking the footprints from the vehicle to the scene of the crime by the beach area. (The location and preservation of aforementioned footprints will be detailed in a supplementary evidence report by Sgt. Snook.)
At 0800 hours Reporting Officers Lonergan and Narlow received information via Park Headquarters that a DR. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his son would like to talk to them at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop regarding a possible suspect in this crime. At 0912 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan contacted DR. R. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his 16-yr. old son DAVID LEE RAYFIELD at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop. DR. RAYFIELD gave a home address of Los Gatos, California. DR. RAYFIELD stated that about 6:30 P.M. the previous evening he and his son had parked their car north of Park Headquarters in the general area of the

crime scene. They stated they went down towards the beach area when DAVID RAYFIELD noticed a white male adult subject walking in the area, described as about 5'10"", heavy build, wearing dark trousers, a dark shirt with red in it, long sleeves. He stated this subject was carrying nothing in his hands and was apparently just walking alongside the hill area about halfway between the road and the lake. DAVID further stated that when the subject observed him he turned around and walked up the hill in a southerly direction. DR. RAYFIELD and his son stated that they did not notice a vehicle in the area of their vehicle and only this subject at a distance of about 100 yards. They also advised there was a man with two young boys in the area shooting B-B guns, but they did not know if this man saw the subject or not. This location was approximately 8/10ths of a mile from the scene of the victim's vehicle. In the opinion of R/Os, it is unlikely, unless this male subject had a vehicle in the immediate area, he could have traversed the area to the scene of the crime on foot. There are four coves of water between the scene of the crime and the area where the doctor saw the subject. The interview with DR. RAYFIELD and his son was terminated at that point.
At 1000 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene of the crime and further assisted Sgt. Snook in the collecting and locating of evidence.
At 1320 hours 9/28/69, R/Os interviewed Ranger Sgt. William White at Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters. White was interviewed as to his activities before and during his part in locating the victims the night before. White stated at approximately 1855 hours 9/27/69 he was on routine patrol around the Lake Berryessa area when he received a call from Park Headquarters to proceed to the Rancho Monticello Resort where a person was reporting a possible stabbing. 
White stated he proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort where he was contacted by ARCHIE E. WHITE, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG. RONALD FONG advised him that he had seen a male and a female victim on the beach area south of Rancho Monticello Resort, hollering that they had been stabbed. Ranger Sgt. White, accompanied by ARCHIE WHITE, ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the beach area via speedboat owned by ARCHIE WHITE. When they arrived on the beach they observed a young female lying on the ground with what appeared to be numerous stab wounds. Ranger Sgt. White stated that the female appeared to be in a great deal of pain. White stated as they discovered the female victim, Ranger Dennis Land arrived at the scene in his pickup truck, carrying a male victim who also appeared to have numerous stab wounds. White stated he immediately radioed in and had Park Headquarters call the Sheriff's Office to dispatch an ambulance and a Deputy. White stated he attempted to interview both the boy and girl victims while awaiting

arrival of the ambulance. According to White, the male victim said that a male subject approached them, wearing a hood, dressed in dark clothing. The subject was carrying what appeared to be an automatic pistol and stated that he wanted their money and car keys. According to White, the male victim related to him that the subject advised him he was an ex-con out of Colorado and was en route to Mexico. Suspect stated he had to tie them up, and after they were tied the responsible stated, ""I'm going to have to stab you."" White further related that the male victim advised the responsible, ""Stab me first, I can't stand to see her stabbed first."" The male victim then advised that the responsible stabbed him numerous times in the back and then stabbed the girl.
The female victim advised White that she could not see the responsible's face as a hood was covering all of his head. She also advised White that the suspect had what appeared to be clip-on sunglasses to cover his eyes. Ranger Sgt. White stated that this is the most he could get out of either victim as they were both in great shock and pain. White stated that he noticed a lot of blood near the girl's groin area. The interview with Ranger Sgt. White was terminated at that point.
9/28/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort and interviewed MR. ARCHIE E. WHITE. (It should be noted that ARCHIE E. WHITE and ELIZABETH WHITE are no relation to Ranger Sgt. White.) ARCHIE E. WHITE is the owner of the Boat Repair Shop at Rancho Monticello Resort. He lives at the Resort. Also interviewed were MR. WHITE's wife, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE. MR. and MRS. WHITE advised that they were contacted by RONALD FONG who advised them he had just observed what appeared to be a male and a female subject lying on the beach south of the Rancho Monticello Resort, covered with blood. FONG advised them that the couple had shouted out to him that they had been stabbed and robbed. MRS. WHITE immediately called Park Headquarters and Ranger Sgt. William White arrived at the Resort a short time later. MR. and MRS. WHITE, accompanied by Ranger Sgt. Bill White and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the scene area in one of MR. WHITE's ski boats. When they arrived on the scene, they observed a young female wearing a sweater dress lying on the beach, covered with blood. When they approached the area she was on her elbows and knees, rocking back and forth as if in great pain. MRS. WHITE stated she immediately attempted to make the victim more comfortable and tried to calm her down until the ambulance arrived. MRS. WHITE stated the girl advised him, ""He was a man with a hood... His face was covered... He was wearing black pants... It hurts, it

hurts."" MRS. WHITE then advised after the female had regained her composure, she told her the man had asked for money but didn't take any. She said she hadn't been raped. MRS. WHITE further advised that the female victim told her that the responsible was wearing glasses, with dark clip-on sunglasses over the hood. She told her that the responsible had a black pistol. MR. ARCHIE WHITE stated he overheard the male victim advise someone that the responsible was wearing gloves. MR. and MRS. WHITE further advised that this is the only information either victim gave them on the responsible, and that they spent the balance of the time attempting to make the victim more comfortable until the arrival of the ambulance.
After the interview with MR. and MRS. WHITE, Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan returned to the Napa County Sheriff's Office.
At 1620 hours R/O Det/Sgt. Narlow was contacted by a DEAN of the Pacific Union College in Angwin. DEAN advised that three young ladies, students at the college, might possibly have information as to a suspect in the attack at Lake Berryessa. The young ladies were identified as MISS JOANNE, MISS LINDA, and MISS LINDA. DEAN advised that these girls had been in the Lake Berryessa area from about 3:00 P.M. to 4:30 P.M. the previous Saturday afternoon. They had observed a male subject in a late model, silver blue Chevrolet, two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. DEAN advised that the girls had told him they were observed out of the car by this subject while they were sunbathing on the beach. They described the subject as approximately 40 years old, [blank] feet tall, dressed in dark clothing. Sgt. Narlow dispatched Deputy Sheriff Raymond Land to interview these three girls that evening. (The report of Land's interview is attached.)
Reporting Officers spent the balance of the day and evening going through their investigative notes and issuing a statewide All Points Bulletin.
Monday, 9/29/69 Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan spent the majority of the morning interviewing numerous citizens and officers from other departments regarding this crime and similar crimes. (A general list of possible suspects was begun and they are noted on separate incident reports as to origin of information and description of suspects, attached.)
Reporting Officers were advised by Deputy Sheriff Ray Land who interviewed the three college girls, MISS [JOANNE], MISS [LINDA], and MISS [LINDA] that the information appeared to have some merit and advised that the three young ladies would be in the office in the afternoon for further interview.

9/29/69 1445 hours The three young ladies came into the office and were interviewed by Sgt. Lonergan, Sgt. Snook, and Capt. Donald Townsend.
Lonergan interviewed a MISS JOANNE MARIE, who, [age] years of age, DOB [blank], her address at the college is 114 Dauphine, Pacific Union College, home address South East 12th, College Place, Washington. MISS [JOANNE] advised R/O that on 9/27/69 at approximately 5:30 P.M. she and her two girlfriends parked their vehicle at a location two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. When they left their car they noticed a subject driving a late model silver blue Chevrolet, 2-door sedan, pull up behind them. What appeared to be a white male adult was sitting in the vehicle. They did not observe this subject leave the vehicle. The girls proceeded to the beach area and were sunbathing in their bikinis. After approximately one-half hour had passed, they observed what appeared to be the same subject standing within 40 or 50 feet of them, apparently observing them. This subject was described as 6' tall, weighing 200/210 lbs., muscular build, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing dark pants and a dark pullover shirt. The subject would stare at the three girls but when they looked up at him he would look away. The subject hung around the area for approximately 45 minutes and then the girls observed him walk up the hill. MISS [JOANNE] stated it was very doubtful that from his vantage point in the vehicle the subject could observe the three girls on the beach. She believes he waited in his vehicle and then followed them down after they were on the beach. MISS [JOANNE] further described the car as appearing very conservative. She stated the car did not appear to belong to any young person such as a teenager. She did state the car had California license plates but did not notice the number.
The other two young ladies, MISS [LINDA] and MISS [LINDA] were interviewed by Sgt. Snook and Capt. Donald Townsend.
MISS LINDA who was interviewed by R/O Det/Sgt. Snook, is a WFA, DOB [blank], home address Sunnyside Road, Sanitarium. She stated she left the Angwin area with two other girls, JOANNE and LINDA at approximately 2:45 P.M. 9/27/69. The girls drove through Pope Valley to Lake Berryessa where they parked their vehicle two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand. MISS [LINDA] stated she observed a subject go into the parking lot area to the south. Subject went past their vehicle and backed up so their rear bumpers were nearly touching. Vehicle described as a 1966 or 1967 light blue Chevrolet with California plates. Witness believes the vehicle was a 2-door sedan and described the headlights as being long rather than round. The rear window glass was tinted quite dark. Another vehicle from Angwin with Arizona plates was in the parking area and witness saw the occupants, a MISS DENISE BROWN and a MR. WAYNE HAIGHT.

to the beach and shortly thereafter noticed the male subject watching them from the edge of the trees. After about 30 minutes the subject came down by the beach and passed within 20 feet of witness as he walked from south to north. Subject was described by MISS [LINDA] as approximately 28 years of age, 6' to 6'2"" tall, 200/225 lbs., black hair possibly styled, with a part on left, rounded eyes, thin lips, medium nose, straight eyebrows, small ears, well built, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing a black short-sleeved sweater shirt, bunched up in front, and a white tee shirt hanging out in back, and dark trousers. The three girls left the area about 4:30 P.M. and the subject's vehicle was gone. Witnesses did not observe the subject either leave or get back into his vehicle.
MISS LINDA LEE was interviewed by R/O Capt. Donald Townsend. MISS [LINDA LEE] is a WFA, DOB [blank], address Howell Mountain Road, Angwin. MISS [LINDA LEE] is employed as a secretary of the college press. MISS [LINDA LEE] observed the same vehicle which was described as a late model Chevrolet, sky blue in color. The rear tail lights appeared to be long rather than round. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated they parked their vehicle at approximately 2:55 P.M. and observed the subject in his vehicle at that location. The girls proceeded to the beach and she, MISS [LINDA LEE], again noticed the subject about 30 to 45 minutes after they were at the beach. She noticed him standing on the bank approximately 45 yards from her location.

Air Force Base and is a Flight Line Mechanic. He is a retired Master Sergeant in the United States Air Force. MR. [BASSEL] showed R/O a pair of Air Force chukker boots that belonged to him. He described these boots as being Government issue, issued to all Air Force personnel at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. They are primarily designed as a wing-walker shoe, however according to MR. [BASSEL] most Air Force personnel and many of the civilian personnel employed at Air Force bases had this type of shoe. The sole design of this shoe exactly matched the plaster cast design that Sgt. Snook had taken at the scene of the crime. It should be noted that Det/Sgt John Robertson had attempted to find a similar shoe design at the local shoe stores in the Napa area with negative results. (Refer Sgt. Robertson's supplementary report.) MR. [BASSEL] was asked if we could keep his shoes for identification purposes and he agreed. R/Os was also advised that this information regarding the type of footprint had not been released to the press or general public. MR. [BASSEL] stated he would cooperate with R/Os and keep this information confidential.

advised that the cause of death was shock and loss of blood brought on by two main stab wounds.
9/30/69, 1430 hours R/O Det/Sgt. Kenneth Narlow contacted CAPT. at Travis Air Force Base and arranged for an interview with COL. and SGT. to take place on Wednesday morning, October 1st, 1969, at 9:00 A.M. R/Os wanted to talk to someone at Travis regarding the shoeprints that were found on the scene. The remainder of the day and evening was spent in answering phone calls from people who had possible knowledge of the crime.
Wednesday, 10/1/69 - 0900 hours Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow went to Travis Air Force Base and were present at an interview in Col. office, who is Commanding Officer in charge of base security. Also present at this meeting besides the aforementioned officers was LT. COL. of the Office of Special Investigation. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan advised the Air Force personnel present of the portion of the evidence we had discovered at the crime scene and asked them for assistance in locating where this type of shoe was sold or issued. LT. COL. advised that his office would assist assigned investigators in attempting to locate the source of the shoe.
Officers were directed to the Base Supply with the assistance of Special Agent DONALD of O.S.I., at which time it was determined through Base Supply that this shoe in question was of Government issue and that it was not kept in stock at Base Supply, however it was believed that the Sales Store had such an item. It was then explained that if a military person or civilian employee was determined to be in need of such an item, he first reported to the Base Supply, at which time he was issued a purchase requisition which he in turn took to the Sales Store and the type of shoe was issued to the individual and they in turn required the individual to sign the purchase requisition showing that he did receive the item. This purchase requisition states the type of shoe that the individual was to receive, however makes no reference as to size.
Assigned investigators, accompanied by Special Agent proceeded to the Sales Store located on Travis Air Force Base. After a short period of time R/Os located in stock a shoe fitting the identical description of the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast which officers had in their possession. The identical shoe with identical tread was found and a shoe bearing the closest measurements in the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast was measured and found to be a size 10 1/2 in military styling or a 10 1/2 D in civilian equivalent. It was determined through Air Force records that they were unable to furnish officers with the

data regarding the sales of this type shoe due to the fact that no recordings were made of the specific sizes, however purchase records indicate over the past 13 months approximately 100 pairs of this size shoe, namely 10 1/2, had been purchased and disposed of through sales. Air Force records indicate this type shoe is manufactured by the International Shoe Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, then shipped to Air Force Depot, Ogden, Utah, and from there shipped to the various military installations upon requisition orders.
10/1/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then proceeded to the Vallejo Police Department and met with Sgt. Jack Mullanax and Sgt. Duane Nilsson. Officers exchanged information regarding Vallejo's crime of 7/4/69 and our particular incident. Suspect information was exchanged and is listed in the separate suspect file.
Investigating Officers checked to determine the validity of the decoded message and as to how far the original cyphers had been decoded. It was then learned that the message had been decoded by at least two different sources, one being by MR. and MRS. HARDIN of Salinas and the other by the FBI in Washington. It was noted that these cyphers were broken independent of one another and the FBI confirmed the validity of the original decoded message. It was also learned that there was a small portion on the very end of the coded message that had not been decoded for reasons unknown.
The balance of the afternoon and evening Reporting Officers and other investigating officers met to exchange information and further discuss the evidence at hand.
Thursday, October 2nd, 1969, 0845 hours Reporting Officer Lonergan received a telephone call from Special Agent, OSI, Travis Air Force Base. Subject called to report that approximately 500 to 1,000 of that type of wing-walker shoe have been sold as surplus on the Base. This would be over and above those sold at the Sales Store. Agent further related he has the names of all the subjects who have purchased this item through surplus and will keep these names available to officers upon request.
The balance of the morning was spent searching fingerprint evidence and answering phone calls from possible witnesses.
Thursday, 10/2/69, 1400 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan attended the funeral services for victim CECELIA SHEPARD. These services were held at the Pacific Union College Church, Angwin, California. Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan positioned themselves

inside the church in order to observe all persons who viewed the services and the remains of victim CECELIA SHEPARD. Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Sgt. Thomas Butler, and Detective Ronald Montgomery of the Napa Police Department positioned themselves outside the church and photographed all persons entering and leaving the services. This included individual photographs and group scenes. Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow also attended the graveside services at the St. Helena Cemetery in St. Helena.
Friday, 10/3/69 - Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Richard Lonergan contacted JAMES, Napa State Hospital, advised him to set up an interview with a patient who is a possible suspect in our case. The patient is identified as GRIFFIN RAYMOND FRANKLIN, WMA, 20 yrs. of age, DOB [blank], 6'2"", 223 lbs. [JAMES] had previously reported that this subject had left the hospital on a pass Friday evening, 9/26/69, and returned to the hospital Monday afternoon, 9/29/69. This subject also had spent time in the Air Force and was discharged from the Air Force in January 1969 for psychiatric problems. According to the doctors at the hospital, this subject was capable of committing this type of a crime. R/O in the presence of JAMES and Security Officer PHIL RYAN interviewed subject FRANKLIN. FRANKLIN was very cooperative and talkative to R/O and went over his activities the prior weekend. Briefly stated, MR. FRANKLIN, whose parents live in Vallejo, never left the Vallejo area that weekend and stayed around home talking with his mother, stepfather, and three brothers. After interviewing subject, it was the opinion of R/O Sgt. Lonergan that this subject was not the responsible. He had a definite very fast manner of speaking which was completely opposed to the victim's statement concerning the suspect's voice. R/O also contacted the mother of the suspect, a MRS. OPAL at Hollywood Avenue, Vallejo. MRS. OPAL stated more or less the exact same thing that her son had stated as to his whereabouts that weekend. It appears that this subject has a reliable alibi as to his activities and had no access to a vehicle that weekend. This subject was cleared as far as this crime is concerned.
The balance of the morning and afternoon was spent by R/Os Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan going over physical evidence and dictating reports.

9/28/69 12:30 P.M. Reporting Officer John Robertson, Det/Sgt., interviewed one of two victims who were each stabbed numerous times by an unknown assailant. Victim CECELIA SHEPARD and victim BRYAN HARTNELL both had been placed in the Queen of the Valley Hospital intensive care unit. Victim SHEPARD had surgery performed on her earlier in the morning (9/28/69) and was unable to be questioned by the Reporting Officer, however Dr. Ludwig gave permission for victim HARTNELL to be interviewed.
Although victim HARTNELL was heavily sedated, he was able to give R/O a verbal statement. (Note: R/O taped electrically the interview with victim HARTNELL.) Victim HARTNELL related the following.
He had known CECELIA SHEPARD for some time, they were good friends, and she had come to the Napa County area to spend the weekend. She and a female companion, DALORA LEE, Aspen, Loma Linda, San Bernardino County, Calif. (phone Ext. 2155) had driven from Southern California and were to drive back Sunday, 9/28/69. Victim stated he and MISS SHEPARD drove to Lake Berryessa, picked a large tree near the shore line where they decided to lie down and enjoy the scenery. While lying on the ground, victim HARTNELL stated he heard a noise and asked MISS SHEPARD if she could hear anything or see anything behind a tree not far from where the couple were lying. MISS SHEPARD told victim HARTNELL she could see a man behind the tree. HARTNELL asked her what he was doing. MISS SHEPARD stated she couldn't tell. HARTNELL stated he (suspect) then came from behind the tree. MISS SHEPARD said, ""Oh my God, he has a gun!""
Victim HARTNELL stated the man approached the couple, aiming a black steel automatic pistol. The suspect stated he needed a car and money. Suspect stated his car was ""hot"" and he wanted victim HARTNELL's car keys. Victim HARTNELL stated he began talking with the suspect, telling the suspect he had no money, only a small amount of change, also that if the suspect was really in need of assistance HARTNELL would attempt to help him. The suspect told victim to get on the ground. Suspect then had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him. HARTNELL stated he attempted to keep the suspect engaged in conversation while suspect was tying the victims.
HARTNELL further stated the suspect was described as follows: Wearing a black hooded mask (cloth), covering suspect's entire head and shoulders, coming down almost to suspect's waist. Victim stated on front of the four-cornered type mask (similar to paper bag in style) there was a symbol, the symbol described as white, approximately 3 x 3 inches in diameter, with a symmetrical cross. Also on the eyelets of the mask was a pair of clip-on sunglasses, the glasses clipped to the eyelets. Victim stated he could also see hair through the mask's eyelets and observed the hair to be dark brown.
Victim stated suspect was wearing a light-weight windbreaker, dark blue or black, pleated slacks (old-fashioned type). Victim could not remember what type of shoes or anything about suspect's hands, could not remember if suspect was wearing gloves.
Victim thought suspect was possibly 20 to 30 years of age by voice concept. Victim stated suspect was 5'8"" to 6', 225-250 lbs., dark brown hair, eyes unknown, sloppy dresser, stomach hanging over trousers. Suspect spoke with some

type of drawl, but victim stated it was not a Southern drawl, did not really know what type of drawl, but thought the man was not well educated, but did not feel he was illiterate either. Victim said suspect's voice was moderate in sound, that is, not high or low pitched.
Suspect told victim he was sent to (?) Lodge State Prison (possibly Deer Lodge State Prison), Montana, for a killing. While there (in prison) he killed a guard while escaping. Suspect also told victims he was heading for Mexico, told victim he was flat broke.
Victim observed cut-up rope in suspect's rear pocket (trouser's), also stated he was wearing a knife in a case (on belt) on his right side, near front of trousers. Knife description: Appeared to be a long bread knife, 12"" long blade, 3/4"" wide, hardwood handle, 2 brass rivets holding handle in place, cotton surgical tape wrapped approximately 1"" around handle of knife. Knife case possibly made of wood.
Victim asked suspect if suspect's gun was loaded. Suspect removed magazine from handle of pistol and showed victim a bullet removed from gun, bullet described as a possible .45 caliber. Victim did not know what caliber the pistol was.
Suspect had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him, suspect then tied victim SHEPARD's hands, then re-tied HARTNELL's hands, then tied both victims' ankles together, had victims lie on their stomachs. HARTNELL stated suspect said, ""I'm getting nervous."" This was when suspect was tying MISS SHEPARD'S hands, in fact HARTNELL stated suspect got real shaky when he was tying MISS SHEPARD's hands.
Victim HARTNELL then stated that without warning the suspect plunged his knife into the back of HARTNELL. Suspect did this repeatedly, HARTNELL stated he thinks six times. HARTNELL stated he pretended to be dead and the suspect went over to MISS SHEPARD and stabbed MISS SHEPARD repeatedly in the back, and when MISS SHEPARD turned her body over (on back), suspect stabbed her in the lower abdomen. Victim stated suspect stabbed MISS SHEPARD much worse than him. Suspect went into some sort of frenzy when stabbing MISS SHEPARD.
Victim HARTNELL stated suspect left the area after the stabbing. Victim HARTNELL hailed a boat (off shore) and told the man in the boat the couple needed help badly. Victim stated the boat left the area and he (victim) attempted to get help by crawling and walking to the road. (Victim believed he had walked to the road, however had not gone too far from his wounded companion.)
Victim stated he thought suspect had been with the couple for approximately fifteen (15) minutes from time of observing suspect until suspect departed. Victim stated suspect did not take his wallet, although when MISS SHEPARD was tying victim HARTNELL's hands, she reached in his pocket and threw his wallet to suspect. Suspect did not take the wallet or victim's car keys.
Victim stated a man in a pickup truck found him on the road and called an ambulance. Victim stated he estimated one hour in time was involved between the time he and MISS SHEPARD were stabbed until help arrived.
MISS SHEPARD is listed in critical condition.

Sgt. ROBERTSON stated that Mr. HARTNELL was heavily sedated but was able to give a verbal statement pertaining to the attack at Lake Berrysessa. The interview was taped and reads as follows:
""INTERVIEW OF JOHN ROBERTSON, DET/SGT., NAPA COUNTY SHERIFF's DEPARTMENT, WITH BRYAN CALVIN HARTNELL (NSO CASE #105907) AT QUEEN OF THE VALLEY HOSPITAL ON SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1969 (TRANSCRIBED FROM TAPE RECORDING BY M. FEURLE):
""J.R. Can you give me this fellow's description and tell me what happened?
""B.H. So many people have been asking me... I hope...
""J.R. Well sometimes when we're repetitious, I know it happens to me, I tell the same thing over and over and over, and sometimes I might vary a little, and if you do...
""B.H. Shall I just start out and tell you what happened?
""J.R. I don't want to tire you out.
""B.H. I just don't want this to happen again to anybody... Of course he might have his reasons, I don't know...
""J.R. Okay. Go right ahead. Start right from the beginning. What happened?
""B.H. Okay. This girl came out from school, I used to go with her two years ago, and she's now going to another school, and she came up to visit some friends and we were having dinner at the school cafeteria, and I said, 'Well, are you doing anything special this afternoon?' and she said, 'Why?', and I said, 'I don't know. We could go out and either go for a walk, go to San Francisco, or, you know, just...', 'cause we used to be good friends. We used to have a good friendship. And so it got too late by the time we got around to what we were going to do. We had to stop in St. Helena for a couple items and then we had to cart a couple kids home and stuff, and by the time we finally got around to it, it was getting late, and I thought going to San Francisco 'd rush you, you know, because by the time we got back for worship... And so we went out to Berryessa, and there was this one place I used to go out... we used to all the time, you know... and I couldn't find it. And so I figured Ah, forget it, and this looks like as good a place as any. So I parked the car, there were no other cars there. I had a Kharman Ghia, '56, white, with a black vinyl top, and it's in pretty

... ""good-looking shape. But we parked there on the road's edge and we talked Oh it must be about a quarter of a mile to down to the place where we went. We had... (unintelligible) peninsula, it's an an island I guess during the wetter season, You can see where it was levee... And so that looked like a lot... there was a big spreading tree up there. There were two of them, really, one was a little bigger than the other. We took the one that was out on the point.
""It was really beautiful out there. We were sitting on top... I lay down on my back and she lay down on her stomach beside me, you know, kind of resting her head on my shoulder, and we were talking, you know, kind of reminiscing about old times, and stuff. And I heard these rustling leaves, and I said, 'You have your specs on. Why don't you see what the deal is over there?' And she says, 'Oh, it's some man.' And I said, 'Is he alone?' and she said, 'Yeah... (unintelligible)...' and she says, 'Well he just stepped behind the tree.' And I said, 'What's the idea of that? To take a leak?' You know, 'cause that's the only thing I could think of, just step behind a tree. And so I says, 'Well, keep looking and tell me what happens,' and she says, 'Oh my God, he's got a gun!' and squeezed my arm and
""And so he came out, and of course still actually I wasn't... There's some things you really wouldn't mind having happen, just for the experience of it. You know I thought, Well I only got fifty cents on me. It's worth all of that having it happen. I didn't think about another angle. So I talked to him, you know. I said, 'Well listen, Mac, (you know I'm in the sociologist field, you know, I'm pre-law, with history and psych.) You know I've read about the criminal mind and everything, you know. I thought well maybe the guy really does need help, you know. I says, 'There's no strings attached.' I says, 'I don't have any money right now but if you need help that badly I can help you out in another way maybe.' And he says, 'Nah.. time's running short,' he says, ''cause I just got out of... some prison in Montana, I don't know what the name of it is. Feathers? Do you know what the name of it is? I'll see if it sounds familiar. Fern or Feathers? It's some double name, like Fern Lock or something...
""J.R. It's Lodge..

""B.H. Oh yeah, yeah, Lodge. At least we know we're together on that.
""J.R. Mountain Lodge Prison, or something of that nature...
""B.H. Yeah. You know he said he broke out and had to kill a guard getting out. And I said, 'Well, man, I mean actually I don't mean to call your bluff or anything, but wouldn't you rather be stuck on a stealing charge than a threat of homicide?' you know? And he says, 'Well just don't start playing hero on me.' You know, 'Don't try to grab the gun,' 'cause I didn't really figure the gun was loaded. I always thought it would be empty. I've heard a lot of times that this is what they do just as a bluff, but I decided not to call his bluff after he really, you know... I told him, 'You know you're really wasting your time with me. I've got a billfold and this much change and that's it.' And he said, he told the girl, 'Go tie him up. I'd feel much better if you were tied up.' And she tied a couple of loose knots on me, so I made it look kind of tight... (unintelligible)... you know, just for a second, and he said 'Go ahead.' And I whispered to her, 'You know I think I can get that gun.' And I said, 'Do you mind?' and she got kind of fearful about it, so I figured since there's two lives involved, not just mine, I won't do it.
""So I let her tie me up on the wrists again, and he tied her up, - terribly tight, you know, real... (unintelligible) ... put his gun away, and we were talking and all, bantering, you know, basically. I was thinking, anything I can do to help, by the way just to keep the conversation going... Suddenly he was taking it all seriously, you know... So I was starting out and finally he said, 'Okay, lay down. I've got her tied up', you know... He strung a rope between our ankles in the rear, so we were like this, you know, on our stomachs, tied...
""J.R. You both facing the ground...
""B.H. Right. And, oh, this was before. I got sort of ahead. So anyway, he said, 'Get down,' and I said, 'Oh come on! We could freeze to death!' I said that a couple, three times, and he said, 'GET DOWN! RIGHT NOW!' He got a little pushed off at me. So I got down and then he finished tying her up and clonked her down, - and then he goes... Sswhooosh (a sound with his mouth)... (unintelligible)

""And so I said, 'Do you have bullets in there?' And so he pulled out the clip and showed me that he did. The bullets were about this long, I can remember, and about this fat, and they had the regular red cap on it, about this long. Maybe that doesn't give you any better description of the gun or not. I don't know. And it came out of the heel, the grip, you know. It slipped out from the bottom.
""And now, to backtrack a bit. I was really trying to see what he looked like, you know. He had on pleated pants, these old type of suit pants, you know, and they were either black or dark blue, I can't remember now. And I can't remember what he was wearing for shoes. But he had on this cotton coat, You've seen the kind, that you just turn the collar up once, there's a zipper down the front, you know. They're real light, super-thin, you know...
""J.R. Kind of a windbreaker...
""B.H. Yeah, like a windbreaker. And it's got this blue, this little collar, sometimes the guys wear them standing up, you know.
""J.R. What color was that?
""B.H. That was dark blue. And I don't know. Maybe he had something in his pouch. I just took it as being a... as being a... you know, he was stout 'cause he looked kind of heavy. I think he was weighing two and a quarter, two fifty, somewhere in there. And I got kind of a look at his hair. His voice... I can remember... almost like I'd heard it before. You know there's some drawls that a lot of people have similar. And... almost as if I'd heard it before... couldn't think where.
""I gave that one up, I just gave it up on that angle. I looked through his hair. I kind of looked like it was combed, you know, like this.. it was a brownish, you know, dark brown hair.
""And this mask he had on. It was ingeniously devised. It was... he had four corners at the top, like the top of a paper sack... black. It came down, came down, with the front panel about to here, and a kind of a thing that came over the shoulders, you know, and then the same thing down the back, straight down. And in the front he had a circle with a symmetrical cross in the middle. You know what I mean by a symmetrical cross?

""J.R. Um hum (affirmative).
""B.H. The ends of the cross hung out about this far on each of the... you know, where it came out. The circle was this much... like this... and then it was like this, you see... hung out on the end, over the edge of the circle.
""And he had clip-on sunglasses... it was hard to tell. You know, the sunglasses you clip on when you're wearing glasses, eyeglasses, He had those clipped on. I'm pretty sure... I don't think he had glasses, though. I think he just had these clipped on to his suit... you know, that little mask.
""And I don't know how tall he was. Maybe 5-8 or maybe 5-10, 6 feet, somewhere in there. I'm a very poor judge of height because of my height. I have no meaning, you know. It's always down, you know. It can never be up...
""And so I saw him put away his gun, and I was turning to say something to Celia, and all of a sudden I felt my back... just... no, I think I saw him pull it out.. I don't remember... I think I saw him whip out his knife and just start stabbing me in the back... CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP! I was just (makes a gutteral sound)... you know that kind of a sound... and Celia turned to see why I was (repeats gutteral sound), you know, and she just about fainted. She went hysterical... (unintelligible) ... and when he finally stopped... I mean he went over and... The doctor says there's six in the back, six wounds on my back. You ought to confirm that. One I've got went clear through the lung. I've got it draining. I did drain a couple pints of blood out as soon as I got here. I lost an awful lot of blood, I guess.
""We were down... I mean it was absolutely no question in my mind... when a person gets stabbed as many times as we did... we were going to die. I mean there'd be no reason to question it. But somehow I, you know, started (unintelligible)... I just knew there was too much I had to live for. I mean really it does happen... about getting depressed and everything... when you're young you always think about these things... you know you think about it... and when you've got someone forcing your hand, oh well, there was a lot of things I had to do. And what really kept me going... you know my parents are pretty Christian. I haven't been too much of a Christian myself... but if you believe in the principle you ask God to help you. Another thing, What was my only strength was knowing two things. One, that I did not want to die, and two, that I felt that whatever was

""going to be was going to be, but I was going to try my damnedest to stay alive. And so, like I say, - before I left her I kissed her, and I said, 'Well,' I says, 'I'm gonna try to get help.'
""There was a boat kept circling around out there in the lake and we started yelling at it and finally it came within about 100 yards of the shore and turned off its motor and stayed there watching us for about fifteen minutes, and we were just screaming hysterically, trying to get their attention, you know, to come over here. Oh, I don't know, I guess they were afraid that the guy might be there in the bushes and they were liable to get choked or something. So finally he came up a little closer. I didn't have my glasses on... I was just swaying, you know... and I had gotten one of her hands free before they came, and so I kept trying to get her to untie me, and she couldn't, she was too weak, she said.
""So finally I just kept hollering and hollering, and she said, 'Turn around and let's see if I can do it again.' She finally got it. My hands and my feet were just pure numbness... they're still numb but I'm sure that will go 'way. But I finally got... (unintelligible)... untie her so she could kind of relax out. 'Cause it was a terrible position, you know, upon our stomachs... (unintelligible)...
""And so I started to go for help. I finally got myself fairly reconciled. I wasn't too worried about dying, if that was what was going to happen, but I knew I had to keep pushing on. I had to force myself into staying alive because it was... I could just see myself... you know, all sort of waves would come over... I just (coughing sound)... (unintelligible)... 'Well, you're not gonna give up this easy', you know. And, like I say, I just kept believing that God would do everything the best, if the thing was gonna happen, but I couldn't see any reason why my dying would be the best good. So I just played along with that.
""I just started to walk toward the road... everything blacked out on me... my visual... my mind was never blacked out, but my visual was. So I lay down... My eyes started to come open... I just saw a haze of trees, you know. In a little while I got up and went another twenty feet, and then the same thing happened... (unintelligible)... and sat down. Next thing I went clear... (unintelligible)... the road, and by that time I just fell... I just... I was trying so hard to go far I just went too far. Finally I heard this pickup

""coming... I was just laying alongside the road, and that's where this guy picked me up.
""They weren't in any hurry at all, it didn't seem like, you know, but they finally called an ambulance. About fifteen minutes later it came... (unintelligible)... but I still believe... I've got feeling... starting to get a little pain to come through. But from the minute that knife blade went in, it was nothing but pure shock from there on. I just did not expect it. I didn't expect that he would do that. That was a variable I had completely left out. And I guess he just took off running after we started running. I don't know. I never saw him before and hope not to see him again... at least outside of a courtroom.
""It's hard for me to explain much more. I mean I'm trying to give you a kind of example of his technique. He had some rope cut up in his back pocket. And he had a ... well, I thought it was a police automatic because it was in one of these black leather cases, you know...
""J.R. Was it in a smooth case, or did it have a basket weave like..
""B.H. Can I have my glasses? Oh, they're not here. It was a smooth one, though.
""J.R. Did he have this hood down to about the middle of his chest?
""B.H. No, about like... well, I'll show you... Here... his stomach.. You know I could see his... (voice fades away)
""J.R. Okay. You said his hair looked dark brown. How could you see his hair?
""B.H. 'Cause I saw it from where those goggles fit. I looked so closely to find out. And when he turned you know they kind of flittered... I could see his hair. It looked kind of greasy.
""J.R. Now was he as heavy as I am?
""B.H. Well I can't say 'cause he wasn't wearing those type of clothes. They were sloppy clothes, you know. And he just had on this old pair of pleated pants. I don't know... How tall are you?
""J.R. I'm about five eleven.

""B.H. Well, like I say, he was dressed kind of sloppily, you know. His pants real tight up here and his stomach kind of pouched a bit, you know. I don't know... it's hard to say 'cause I can't judge you with being in a suit and all, you know, and him not being professional-looking at all. He could be about the same. It's hard to say. He was so sloppily dressed.
""J.R. Bryan, you also mentioned a drawl. Well not a drawl, an accent.
""B.H. It was just something... I guess his way of talking. It was something I couldn't repeat. It's like a song. Sometimes you know what you're going to say but you just can't sing the melody worth a darn.
""J.R. Did he have a throaty voice or a high pitched?
""B.H. In between. But it was just a unique way of talking.
""J.R. Did he sound like an educated man?
""B.H. Heck no! I don't think so.
""J.R. Did he sound illiterate?
""B.H. No. He didn't sound that way either. He just impressed me as being rather low class. The reason was because of his clothes, you know.
""J.R. Did you lose consciousness when he stabbed you at any time? Did you observe him stab Cecelia?
""B.H. Yeah...
""J.R. What did he say after...
""B.H. He stabbed her a bunch of times in the back. After she turned around, he got her once in the groin and one in the arm I think. He kind of went a little more hog-wild with her than with me. I faked dead... like that... I didn't want him to come back and give me some more.
""J.R. So you were pretty sure he thought you were dead when he finished working on you?

""B.H. I think he kind of thought that. Of course I don't know because we started talking right after he left. It's hard to say... (unintelligible)... I don't think she fainted either.
""J.R. Was she in a lot of pain, did she tell you?
""B.H. Oh yeah. She was more weak at the time... (unintelligible).. from the religious angle. I told her I sure as heck wasn't going to have any deathbed conversion. 'No,' she says... (unintelligible)... I mean it was just like you were gonna die and had a few things to say. But I felt more and more I wasn't losing strength as much... (unintelligible)... that I thought I could cope with...
""J.R. What you did was a courageous thing. It was a terrible thing to have happen to anyone.
""B.H. Well there was nothing we could do. We were kind of at the mercy of him. I mean I wanted to get that gun... (unintelligible)... There was a time I think I could have gotten it...
""J.R. Did it appear to be a .45 to you? An automatic?
""B.H. It was about this long... along the stock... and had a wood edge on it, you know.. on either side...
""J.R. Handles.
""B.H. Yeah...yeah...
""J.R. Did the bullet look anything like that?
""B.H. No. It was kind of like this, only it was gold, and this part here came out along with this and then round the gold, round the blunt end. Not quite that blunt-ended, though.
""J.R. Was it fat? Fatter than this?
""B.H. Yeah, I think it was a little fatter. But it was gold, you know. And I didn't see any of this here. There was a part where it crimped... Well, almost like that 22, short, only a lot bigger. It was about like this length, maybe more stubby.

""J.R. Did he swear? Did he use any profane language or obscenity?
""B.H. I don't think so. If he did it was no more than I was using at the time. I don't think he used any obscenity. He might have used a swear word or something, you know. That wasn't striking to me...
""J.R. Do you have any idea what his motive might have been? Money?
""B.H. Money. He said he was going to go to Mexico and he was flat broke.
""J.R. Did he search you after he...
""B.H. Heck no! Very unprofessional. He didn't even end up taking that loose change and didn't even take my billfold.
""J.R. Why did he stab you when you weren't fighting him off or anything?
""B.H. I couldn't. Even if I'd have wanted to. I was laying on my stomach...
""J.R. So what would have been the purpose of him to stab you, do you think?

Text: The phone call was received by stand-in dispatcher Dave Slaight who heard Zodiac speak the words ""I want to report a murder, no, a double murder. They are two miles north of Park Headquarters. They were in a white Volkswagen Karmann Ghia. I'm the one that did it."" After completing his message the Zodiac Killer, probably learning from his experience at Blue Rock Springs, failed to hang up the phone. Dave Slaight contacted the Sheriff's Office to inform them of the call, and at approximately 7:45 pm the Napa County Sheriff's Office, unable to trace the call, asked for assistance - and a news director at KVON radio by the name of Pat Stanley sprang into action after hearing about the brutal attack on his police scanner.

He stated ""The receiver on the phone the Zodiac used was put down, but not hung up. Technology then was not like it is today. The phone company could only report that the call came from a pay telephone somewhere between Lake Berryessa and Napa. The Napa County Sheriff's Department wanted to find the phone, and fast, so virtually any official with a radio was asked to help. This reporter jumped into action. After a brief stop at the Sheriff's Department, I drove north on Main Street. Driving past a car wash and the historic Sam Key Laundry Building, I spotted a pay phone, but thought the call must have come from closer to the lake, nearly 30 miles away. At the last second, though, I swerved my car toward the phone booth and was shocked to find the receiver off the hook. I used my own two-way radio back to KVON where I instructed the on-duty deejay to call police. They, in turn, told me not to move until officers arrived.""

Upon responding to the above location, officers Peda and Pelissetti found Yellow Cab #912 parked at the northeast corner of Washington St. at the corner of Cherry St.
The reporter, together with two other witnesses—[ages 13 and 14], same address and phone—stated that they saw the below-described suspect seated in the front seat of the cab, on the passenger side, with the victim slumped partially over his lap. The suspect appeared to be searching the victim’s pockets. (Witnesses never heard a gunshot.)
The suspect was observed wiping [fingerprints] on the interior of the cab, leaning over the victim toward the driver’s side. He then exited the cab from the right-hand passenger door, walked around to the driver’s side, and wiped the exterior and interior surfaces near the driver’s door and dashboard.
The suspect then walked north on Cherry St. toward Jackson St. The witnesses immediately notified the police.
Responding officers checked the interior of the cab and found the victim slumped over the front seat, head in the passenger area, blood flowing from a wound to the right rear of the head. Fire Department Rescue responded; victim pronounced dead at 10:10 p.m.

I am the murderer of the taxi driver over by Washington St & Maple St last night, to prove this here is a blood stained piece of his shirt. I am the same man who did in the people in the north bay area.
The S.F. Police could have caught me last night if they had searched the park properly instead of holding road races with their motorcicles seeing who could make the most noise. The car drivers should have just parked their cars and sat there quietly waiting for me to come out of cover.
School children make nice targets, I think I shall wipe out a school bus some morning. Just shoot out the front tire & then pick off the kiddies as they come bouncing out.

INTRA-DEPARTMENTAL MEMORANDUM

DIST. BUR. DET.: Richmond DAY & DATE: Wed., 11/12/69
TO: Insp. Armstrong & Toschi Homicide Detail
SUBJECT: Information re: Stein murder  Possible Zodiac suspect


Sir;

I respectfully wish to report the following, that while responding to the area of Cherry and Washington Streets a suspect fitting the description of the Zodiac killer was observed by officer Fouke walking in an easterly direction on Jackson street and then turn north on Maple street. This subject was not stopped as the description received from communications that a negro male. When the right description was broadcast reporting officer informed communications that a possible suspect had been going north on Maple Street into the Presidio. The area of Julius Kahn playground and a search was started which had negative results.

The suspect that was observed by officer Fouke was a WMA 35-45 yrs, about 5’10”, 180-200 lbs, medium heavy build – barrel chested – medium complexion – light colored hair possibly graying in rear (may have been lighting that caused this effect) crew cut – wearing glasses. Dressed in dark blue waist length zipper type jacket (Navy or royal blue) elastic cuffs and waist band zipped part way up. Brown wool pants pleated type baggy in rear (rust brown) may have been wearing low cut shoes.

Subject at no time appeared to be in a hurry walked with a shuffling lope. Slightly bent forward head down. The subject’s general appearance to classify him as a group would be that he might be of Welsh ancestry.

My partner that night was officer E. Zelms #1348 of Richmond station. I do not know if he observed this subject or not.

Respectfully submitted,

(signed) Donald J. Fouke

This attack marked a significant shift in the Zodiac's pattern, as it was his only confirmed killing in San Francisco and his only known use of a handgun in an urban setting.\n\n## The Crime\n\nAt approximately 9:55 PM, Stine, driving Yellow Cab #912, picked up a passenger at the intersection of Mason and Geary Streets in downtown San Francisco. The passenger requested to be taken to Washington and Maple Streets in the affluent Presidio Heights neighborhood. However, for unknown reasons, the cab stopped at Washington and Cherry Streets, one block beyond the requested destination.\n\nThere, the passenger shot Stine once in the head with a 9mm semiautomatic pistol at close range. Three teenagers witnessed the crime from their home across the street and observed the killer searching through Stine's pockets and wiping down areas of the cab, presumably to remove fingerprints. The witnesses called police as the killer calmly walked north on Cherry Street toward the Presidio military base.\n\n## Police Response\n\nOfficers Frank Peda and Armand Pelissetti responded to the scene. Due to a dispatcher error, responding officers were initially told to look for a Black male suspect. This miscommunication may have contributed to a critical missed opportunity when SFPD officers Don Fouke and Eric Zelms reportedly passed a white male matching the Zodiac's description walking east on Jackson Street, but did not stop him because they were looking for a Black suspect.\n\nWhen police arrived at the scene, they found Stine's body slumped over in the front seat with a fatal gunshot wound to the right side of his head. The cab's meter was still running, showing $6.25 at 10:46 PM. Stine's wallet and the cab keys were missing. The victim was pronounced dead at 10:10 PM.\n\n## Zodiac's Claim\n\nTwo days later, on October 13, the San Francisco Chronicle received a letter beginning with \""This is the Zodiac speaking.\"" The letter claimed responsibility for killing \""the taxi driver over by Washington St & Maple St last night\"" and included a blood-stained piece of Stine's shirt as proof. This physical evidence definitively linked the letter writer to the crime.\n\nIn the letter, the Zodiac criticized police for failing to catch him, writing: \""The S.F. Police could have caught me last night if they had searched the park properly instead of holding road races with their motorcicles seeing who could make the most noise.\"" He then made his most chilling threat yet: \""School children make nice targets, I think I shall wipe out a school bus some morning. Just shoot out the front tire & then pick off the kiddies as they come bouncing out.\""\n\n## Investigation\n\nBased on descriptions from the teenage witnesses, police created a composite sketch of the suspect: a white male in his early 40s, approximately 5'8\"" with a heavy build, reddish-blond crew-cut hair, wearing glasses and a navy blue or black jacket. The crime scene yielded what investigators believed were the killer's fingerprints, though the Zodiac later claimed in correspondence that he had used glue on his fingertips to avoid leaving prints.\n\nThe murder of Paul Stine is significant because it represents a departure from the Zodiac's previous pattern of attacking couples in secluded areas. This urban killing of a lone male victim demonstrated the killer's boldness and adaptability. The threat against schoolchildren that followed led to heightened security measures, with police cars and aircraft following school buses and armed officers riding onboard for protection.\n\nPaul Stine was cremated following a funeral service at the First Unitarian Church in San Francisco on October 14, 1969. He was survived by his wife Claudia, and was remembered as a graduate student at San Francisco State and a life insurance agent for Northern Life Insurance Company.\n\nDespite extensive investigation, including the examination of numerous suspects over the decades, the Zodiac Killer was never identified or apprehended, and the murder of Paul Stine remains officially unsolved.""}","{""isStale"": true, ""state"": ""empty"", ""value"": null}",2026-02-15T17:19:09.000Z,true,Site of Paul Stine's Murder,the-murder-of-paul-stine-in-presidio-heights,11,rec7ir3vRKETmXfrI,,Crime Night,

Please Rush to Editor

This is the Zodiac speaking
Up to the end of Oct I have killed 7 people. I have grown rather angry with the police for their telling lies about me. So I shall change the way the collecting of slaves. I shall no longer announce to anyone. When I comitt my murders, they shall look like routine robberies, killings of anger, & a few fake accidents, etc.
The police shall never catch me, because I have been too clever for them.
1. I look like the description passed out only when I do my thing, the rest of the time I look entirle different. I shall not tell you what my descise consists of when I kill
2. As of yet I have left no fingerprints behind me contrary to what the police say in my killings I wear transparent finger tip guards. All it is is 2 coats of airplane cement coated on my finger tips—quite unnoticible & very efective.
3. my killing tools have been boughten through the mail order outfits before the ban went into efect. Except one & it was bought out of the state.
So as you can see the police don't have much to work on. If you wonder why I was wipeing the cab down I was leaving fake clews for the police to run all over town with, as one might say, I gave the cops som bussy work to do to keep them happy. I enjoy needling the blue pigs. Hey blue pig I was in the park—you were useing fire trucks to mask the sound of your cruzeing prowl cars. The dogs never came with in 2 blocks of me & they were to the west & there was only 2 groups of parking about 10 min apart then the motor cicles went by about 150 ft away going from south to north west.
Must print in paper [bolded areas below]
ps. 2 cops pulled a goof abot 3 min after I left the cab. I was walking down the hill to the park when this cop car pulled up & one of them called me over & asked if I saw anyone acting suspicious or strange in the last 5 to 10 min & I said yes there was this man who was runnig by waveing a gun & the cops peeled rubber & went around the corner as I directed them & I disappeared into the park a block & a half away never to be seen again.
Hey pig doesnt it rile you up to have your noze rubed in your booboos?
If you cops think I'm going to take on a bus the way I stated I was, you deserve to have holes in your heads.
Take one bag of ammonium nitrate fertilizer & 1 gal of stove oil & dump a few bags of gravel on top & then set the shit off & will positivily ventalate any thing that should be in the way of the blast.
The death machine is all ready made. I would have sent you pictures but you would be nasty enough to trace them back to developer & then to me, so I shall describe my masterpiece to you. The nice part of it is all the parts can be bought on the open market with no questions asked.
- 1 bat. pow clock—will run for aprox 1 year
- 1 photoelectric switch
- 2 copper leaf springs
- 2 6V car bat
- 1 flash light bulb & reflector
- 1 mirror
- 2 18"" cardboard tubes black with shoe polish in side & oute
the system checks out from one end to the other in my tests. What you do not know is whether the death machine is at the sight or whether it is being stored in my basement for future use. I think you do not have the manpower to stop this one by continually searching the road sides looking for this thing. & it wont do to re roat & re schedule the busses because the bomb can be adapted to new conditions.
Have fun!! By the way it could be rather messy if you try to bluff me.
PS. Be shure to print the part I marked out on page 3 or I shall do my thing ⌖

To prove that I am the Zodiac, Ask the Vallejo cop about my electric gun sight which I used to start my collecting of slaves.

By the way have you cracked the last cipher I sent you?
My name is—

[Z13 cipher]

I am mildly cerous as to how much money you have on my head now. I hope you do not think that I was the one who wiped out that blue meannie with a bomb at the cop station. Even though I talked about killing school children with one. It just wouldn't doo to move in on someone elses teritory. But there is more glory in killing a cop than a cid because a cop can shoot back. I have killed ten people to date. It would have been a lot more except that my bus bomb was a dud. I was swamped out by the rain we had a while back.
The new bomb is set up like this
PS I hope you have fun trying to figgure out who I killed

Others shall be placed in cages & fed salt beef untill they are gorged then I shall listen to their pleass for water and I shall laugh at them. Others will hang by their thumbs & burn in the sun then I will rub them down with deep heat to warm them up. Others I shall skin them alive & let them run around screaming.

As some day it may hapen that a victom must be found. I've got a little list. I've got a little list, of society offenders who might well be underground who would never be missed who would never be missed. There is the pestulentual nucences who whrite for autographs, all people who have flabby hands and irritating laughs. All children who are up in dates and implore you with im platt. All people who are shakeing hands shake hands like that. And all third persons who with unspoiling take thoes who insist. They'd none of them be missed. They'd none of them be missed. There's the banjo seranader and the others of his race and the piano orginast I got him on the list. All people who eat pepermint and phomphit in your face, they would never be missed They would never be missed And the Idiout who phraises with inthusastic tone of centuries but this and every country but his own. And the lady from the provences who dress like a guy who doesn't cry and the singurly abnormily the girl who never kissed. I don't think she would be missed Im shure she wouldn't be missed. And that nice impriest that is rather rife the judicial hummerest I've got him on the list All funny fellows, commic men and clowns of private life. They'd none of them be missed. They'd none of them be missed. And uncompromiseing kind such as wachmacallit, thingmebob, and like wise, well—nevermind, and tut tut tut tut, and whatshisname, and you know who, but the task of filling up the blanks I rather leave up to you. But it really doesn't matter whom you place upon the list, for none of them be missed, none of them be missed.

Like I have allways said, I am crack proof. If the Blue Meannies are evere going to catch me, they had best get off their fat asses & do something. Because the longer they fiddle & fart around, the more slaves I will collect for my after life. I do have to give them credit for stumbling across my riverside activity, but they are only finding the easy ones, there are a hell of a lot more down there. The reason I'm writing to the Times is this, They don't bury me on the back pages like some of the others.

Text: DUNBAR: Talk to us. Just, tell us what’s going on, inside you, right now. Please.
CALLER: I have headaches.
DUNBAR: Right.
BELLI: How long have you had those headaches, uh, Sam? Been a long time?
CALLER: Since I killed a kid.
BELLI: Well, was it before December that you had the headaches?
CALLER: (pause) Yes.
BELLI: If, did, were you in service, that you might have had an injury in service, did you ever fall out of a tree or down stairs? Were you ever unconscious?
CALLER: (pause) I don’t know.
BELLI: You don’t remember. Does aspirin do you any good?
CALLER: No.
BELLI: Doesn’t do you any good?
CALLER: No.
DUNBAR: Sam –
BELLI: Damn stuff never did me any good either.
DUNBAR: Sam, let me ask you a question. Did you, um, did you attempt to call this program one other time when Mr. Belli was with us? And, you called –
CALLER: What?
DUNBAR: Did you try to call us one other time about, oh, two or three weeks ago when Mel Belli was with us?
CALLER: Yes.
DUNBAR: And you, uh, well –
BELLI: You couldn’t get through, and we were talking?
DUNBAR: And you couldn’t get through, the phones were tied up, is that it?
CALLER: Yes.
BELLI: Sam, let me ask you this – There’s some reason why you go to a particular doctor or a particular priest, and some reason why apparently you wanted to talk to me, or Lee? Is it that you feel we have compassion for people who get in trouble? Or, is that you feel that we can do something for you? Or is that you feel we’re, we’re, have enough integrity that if we promise you something, that we’re gonna stick to it?
DUNBAR: Well, let’s find out why he wanted to talk to – Why did you want to talk to Mr. Belli, Sam?
CALLER: I don’t want to be hurt.
BELLI: You’re not going to be hurt. You’re not going to be hurt if you talk to me.
DUNBAR: You’re not going to the gas chamber.
BELLI: I wouldn’t think they’d ask for capital punishment. We should ask the district attorney—you want me to do that, Sam? You want me to talk to the district attorney?
[At this point, Sam screamed.]
BELLI: What was that?
CALLER: I did not say anything. That was my headache.
BELLI: It sounds like you’re in a great deal of pain. Your voice sounds muffled. What’s the matter?
CALLER: My head aches. I’m so sick. I’m having one of my headaches.
[Another scream.]
CALLER: I’m going to kill them. I’m going to kill all those kids!

DMV Sacramento reports this vehicle registered to suspect. Checked local sources in attempt to obtain specimen of suspect's printing. Numerous specimens obtained from a source which requested to remain anonymous at this time.

On checking prior reports it was ascertained that Allen was formerly employed as an attendant at Harry Wogan's service Station, Sonoma & Alabama Streets. Checked this location and was informed by owner Allen had left his employment to return to school at Sonoma State. Wogan described him as an honest, efficient worker, but a person who showed too much interest in small children. This habit made

VALLEJO POLICE DEPARTMENT OFFICER'S REPORT concerning Zodiac Case No. 243 146
In past week RO has conducted a discreet background investigation on suspect Arthur Leigh Allen. Allen has an excellent reputation with neighbors living in the same block in which he resides. Mostly older people living in this neighborhood and most have known Allen since he was a small boy. No indication given to those persons contacted as to our reason for wishing information on suspect. It was ascertained Allen is presently employed by Union Oil of Calif. at their Pinole refinery. This is a summer job and it is his intention to return to school at the Fall semester at Sonoma State. He lives with his mother who is a widow. Father was a much decorated Commander, USN, retired. Father died approximately six months ago. Allen occupies basement apartment in his mother's home. Contrary to prior reports, neighbors state Allen is very devoted to his mother and she to him.

11:30 AM Writer phoned Union Oil (799-4411) and spoke with Mr. McNamara, Personnel Department. Mr. McNamara confirmed the fact Allen was employed as a junior chemist in their lab. He works 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. He will be made available for interview by officers at any time during working hours. Private office will be provided for this purpose. Allen will not be informed of our desire to talk to him prior to his being brought to office. Armstrong & Tochi, Homicide Division, SFPD, notified, (Mulanax).

8-4-71 10:30 AM With Inspectors Armstrong & Tochi, S.F.P.D., RO contacted Mr. McNamara in his office at Union Oil Company. Mr. McNamara phoned the lab and requested Arthur Allen to come to his office. On Allen's arrival McNamara left. Prior to interviewing Allen it was decided the initial questioning of suspect would be conducted by Inspector Armstrong.

After identifying ourselves as police officers, Allen was notified by Armstrong that we were investigating the Zodiac murders. He was further advised that it had been brought to our attention by an unnamed informant that Allen was alleged to have made certain statements approximately 11 months prior to the first Zodiac murder, which, if true, were of an incriminating nature. Allen was then informed by Armstrong of the conversation Allen had with Donald Cheney in January, 1968, but Allen was not told who this conversation was supposed to have been with. Allen was asked if he recalled having had such a conversation with anyone and replied that he did not recall such a conversation. He was asked if he had read or heard of the Zodiac and he replied he had read about Zodiac when it first appeared in the newspapers. He stated after the initial reading he did not follow it any longer as he thought it was ""too morbid"". Allen later made other statements which were in direct conflict with this prior statement.

He volunteered the information that he had been questioned as a suspect by a Vallejo police sergeant after the Berryessa murder in Napa County. He stated on this particular weekend he had gone to a place called Salt Point Ranch near Fort Ross skin diving.

He went alone but stated he became acquainted with a serviceman and his wife who was stationed on Treasure Island. He did not recall this person's name but had it written down somewhere at home. He returned to Vallejo at approximately 4:00 p.m. and recalls talking to a neighbor shortly after he drove into his driveway. Allen stated he had neglected to inform the Vallejo officer who had talked to him about being seen by this neighbor at the time he was questioned. This neighbor, named White, died approximately a week after he was questioned so he never bothered to recontact the police.

Without any questioning regarding a knife, Allen made the following statement: ""The two knives I had in my car with blood on them, the blood came from a chicken I had killed"". He evidently of the opinion we had some information regarding a knife that we did not possess.

Writer researched VPD files and unable to locate any report where Allen had previously been questioned regarding being Zodiac suspect. Also contacted Sgt. Lynch and he does not recall having questioned Allen.

At a later point in interview Allen stated he had been in southern California at the approximate time as the Riverside murder in which Zodiac is a suspect. The information volunteered by Allen without prompting. He admitted to being interested in guns but claimed only hand guns he owned were 22 caliber.

During interview it was noted Allen was wearing an unusual looking watch. The watch was shown officers by Allen and the brand name of watch was ""Zodiac"". Above the brand name was the circle and cross

hairs such as used as a signature on notes written by Zodiac. Allen stated watch was given to him as a present from his mother approximately two years ago.
Allen expressed his willingness to assist investigators in any manner possible. Stated he wished the time would come when police officers were no longer referred to as ""Pigs"". Prior to terminating interview writer asked Allen if he could recall anyone whom he might have had a conversation with regarding Zodiac. He stated he might have had a conversation with Mr. Kidder or Mr. Tucker of the Vallejo Recreation Department while he was employed there, but he was not positive.

Allen also related having read a book in high school which made a lasting impression on him. He stated the title of the book was ""The Most Dangerous Game"". This book was made into a movie and concerns a man shipwrecked on an island and being hunted by another man ""like an animal"". In conversation with Cheney, Allen is alleged to have disuussed this story.

After interview with Allen, it was opinion of all three investigators that further investigation should be conducted.

8-4-71 11:30 AM With Inspector Toschi, RO contacted Ted Kidder, head of Greater Vallejo Recreation District, 395 Amador Street. Mr. Kidder was asked if he knew Arthur Allen and if he recalled ever having discussed the Zodiac case with him. Kidder stated to his knowledge he had never talked about the Zodiac with Allen. Allen was formerly employed by the Recreation District as a life guard and trampoline instructor. His employment had been terminated approximately five years ago because of Allen's association with small children. Mr. Kidder had received numerous complaints from concerned parents of various acts towards their children by Allen. No formal complaint was ever made to the police re-Allen's acts. Kidder further remarked that as recently as three weeks ago he had a discussion with Philip Tucker, General Supervisor, Recreation District, concerning Allen as being a suspect in Zodiac murders. This discussion came about primarily because of Allen's suspected possibility of being a sexual deviate towards children and physical description. Both parties considered him a ""loner"" type.

Philip Tucker was called to Mr. Kidder's office and questioned about any conversations he might have had with Allen concerning Zodiac. He recalled casual type conversations and on one such occasion Allen told him that he had been questioned by police as a suspect. Tucker remembered Allen having discussed a special light attached to a gun barrel so that a person could shoot accurately at night. On another occasion he and his wife had visited Allen in his home. Allen had

made the remark that he had something he would like to show them, Stated that he only showed this particular thing to ""very certain people"" or something to this effect. He then took from a grey metal box, located in his bedroom, a paper. This paper was hand printed and pertained to a person who had been committed to Atascadero State Hospital for molesting a child. It rambled on and on about this person having been betrayed by his attorney, using language of a legal nature or terminology. Also in this script were various symbols similar to those used by Zodiac in his coded messages. Symbols and code very neatly done. Tucker expressed a polite interest in paper but his wife showed genuine interest. She asked Allen if she might borrow the paper to study it but Allen refused to allow her to take the paper. He did promise to have a copy made to give her. This he never did.

Tucker was asked if, to his knowledge, Allen had an interest in guns. He stated that he did have and owned two hand guns, one a revolver and the other some type of automatic. He did not know the calibers and admitted he did not have abundant knowledge of guns himself. When Allen was questioned he did not admit owning or having owned an automatic weapon.

Also when Allen was questioned RO asked him if he had ever owned a 1965-66 brown Corvair. He replied in the negative. This the type of car described by survivor of Blue Rock Springs murder as being driven by responsible on night of Ferrin murder July 4, 1969. Tucker was asked if he had any knowledge of Allen ever having owned such a car.

VALLEJO POLICE DEPARTMENT OFFICER'S REPORT concerning Zodiac Case No. 243 146
He stated that to his knowledge he had not, but that he, Tucker, had owned a brown 1964 Corvair. When asked if he had ever loaned this vehicle to Allen, Tucker stated he had not. At the time he had two cars, the Corvair and a Pontiac, Allen had used his Pontiac on occasion. At this particular time Tucker was living in Berkeley. In the summer of 1969 he had left the Corvair parked at the Richfield Service station at Nebraska and Broadway for a period of approximately two weeks in an attempt to sell it. Keys were left at the station. At this time Arthur Allen was employed at this service station as an attendant. The exact time car was left could not be recalled by Mr. Tucker other than it was mid-summer of 1969.

Tucker further stated that approximately three weeks prior he had been contacted by Karen Allen, sister-in-law of suspect, and requested to contact Allen re-seeking some type of psychiatric treatment. This was because of some recent involvement with a child that the family had received a complaint about. He stated he did talk to Allen in his home but apparently could not get through to him he needed help. Conversation ended by Tucker requesting Allen not to come around his home in the future and that their association had come to an end.

Officers unable to contact Mrs. Tucker re-what she might have recalled about the script she had seen at Allen's home on prior mentioned occasion as she works graveyard shift in an Oakland hospital. She will be contacted at a later date.

8-4-71 2:00 PM Karen Allen, sister-in-law of suspect, contacted at her place of employment and appointment made to have her come to the police department. On arrival she was advised as to the reasons we wished to talk to her and seemed surprised that Arthur Allen was suspected as possibly being the Zodiac. Mrs. Allen promised her assistance in any manner possible. She stated she and her husband were aware that Allen had some type of hangup regarding children but that she could not believe he could be Zodiac. Mrs. Allen stated Arthur hated women, had never had a serious relationship with a woman his own age. He resented her and had made threats against her as he thought she had come between him and her husband. According to Karen, Arthur was spoiled and pampered by his mother. Mother did his cooking, washed his clothes, cleaned up after him and gave him money. Mother paid for two automobiles and two boats. She further stated Arthur hated his mother and had often expressed this hatred in her presence.

Karen was shown various notes written by Zodiac to the newspapers. She could not recognize printing as being similar to suspect's but did relate that certain phrases were of the context that he would use. As an example, she stated he would use the phrase ""trigger mach"" instead of trigger mechanism. When she saw the Christmas card addressed to Melvin Belli spelled ""Mery Xmass"" Karen stated she definitely recalled having received a card at Christmas from Arthur in which Merry Xmas was spelled exactly the same way.

Karen stated Allen was left-handed, but when he was in school his teachers had attempted to convert him to right hand. He learned to write right-handed but soon reverted back to using his left hand.

Karen Allen is a WFA, 26, formerly taught school. Her husband, Ronald, is WMA, 32, landscape engineer. Appointment made to come to her home at 8:00 p.m. this date & discuss matter with her husband.

8:15 PM Inspectors Armstrong and Toschi and RO to 216 Aragon Street. Ron Allen promised all assistance possible in investigation but could not believe his brother could be a serious suspect in this case. Ron apparently had a sincere desire to assist but could offer little to either confirm or clear matter under investigation. He did say that he was well acquainted with our sources of information who had originally given statements to police indicating Arthur Leigh Allen was a prime suspect. Ron Allen stated they were responsible people who would not have made such statements if they were not true. He further stated that he had received a complaint from Cheney that his brother had made improper advances toward one of his children. This might be a motive why Cheney would make such an accusation against Arthur Allen. This is RO's observation and not Ronald Allen's.


Ronald had no knowledge of any notes possessed by his brother such as described by Tucker. He did have knowledge of a grey metal box in his brother's bedroom. Stated as far as he knew his brother owned two guns, both 22 caliber revolvers. Also of the opinion brother drank to excess and had a definite problem as far as children were concerned. Ronald stated if he could develop anything which might assist in investigation he would contact RO.

8-11-71 11:00 AM RO contacted Bob Luce, owner-operator of the Arco Service Station, 640 Broadway. Mr. Luce was informed we were conducting an investigation on a former employee but not informed as to what. He stated Allen had been employed by him on a part-time basis for approximately six months. He was undependable and had a drinking problem. Again the subject of children came up. He seemed to be too interested in small girls. After several warnings regarding Allen coming to work under the influence of intoxicants or of not showing up as scheduled, Luce terminated his employment. Work records show he was discharged in April 1969. Luce recalls Tucker having his car at his service station, but he does not think it was for a two-week period. In any event, this would seem to negate the possibility Allen could have used this particular car on July 4, 1969 as he was no longer employed by Luce and no one can recall the exact date vehicle was left at station.

8-11-71 5:00 PM RO contacted Mrs. Philip (Joan) Tucker at her residence 215 Daniels. Mrs. Tucker was questioned regarding the papers shown her by Allen which contained some type of code. She related substantially the same story as her husband had given. At the time she was shown the writings she was preparing for an examination in college in psychology and admitted that she was very interested in contents of letters. Allen had explained he had received these papers from a patient at Atascadero and Mrs. Tucker's interest was primarily directed towards the working of this person's mind. The exactness and neatness of the printing and of the symbols used made an impression on her. She was shown photostatic copies of some of the codes sent by Zodiac. She identified numerous symbols used in Zodiac code as being the same as she saw in the papers shown her by Allen. It was her recollection these papers were drawn with a felt-point pen.

5:30 PM Mr. Tucker arrived home from work. He was also shown the Zodiac codes and also stated they appeared the same as those shown him by Allen. Mr. Tucker was questioned further regarding when he left his 1964 Corvair at the service station, 640 Broadway, where Allen was employed. He could not recall the date. He did state that after this time when the car was not sold he had left it parked in front of his father-in-law's home for a considerable period of time. It is possible that Allen could have driven car during this period but

he has no knowledge that he in fact did. In-laws are in Europe at present time and on return he will ask them if they have any knowledge of Allen using the car during this period. In-laws knew Allen as a friend of Tucker's.

Tucker stated Allen was, in his opinion, a schizophrenic personality. He is an avid reader of science fiction literature and at times seems to live what he has read. He can tell a lie and actually believe what he is telling. Tucker again related Allen's apparent and expressed hatred for women.

VALLEJO POLICE DEPARTMENT OFFICER'S REPORT concerning Zodiac Case No. 243 146
In past week RO has conducted a discreet background investigation on suspect Arthur Leigh Allen. Allen has an excellent reputation with neighbors living in the same block in which he resides. Mostly older people living in this neighborhood and most have known Allen since he was a small boy. No indication given to those persons contacted as to our reason for wishing information on suspect. It was ascertained Allen is presently employed by Union Oil of Calif. at their Pinole refinery. This is a summer job and it is his intention to return to school at the Fall semester at Sonoma State. He lives with his mother who is a widow. Father was a much decorated Commander, USN, retired. Father died approximately six months ago. Allen occupies basement apartment in his mother's home. Contrary to prior reports, neighbors state Allen is very devoted to his mother and she to him.

11:30 AM Writer phoned Union Oil (799-4411) and spoke with Mr. McNamara, Personnel Department. Mr. McNamara confirmed the fact Allen was employed as a junior chemist in their lab. He works 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. He will be made available for interview by officers at any time during working hours. Private office will be provided for this purpose. Allen will not be informed of our desire to talk to him prior to his being brought to office. Armstrong & Tochi, Homicide Division, SFPD, notified, (Mulanax).

8-4-71 10:30 AM With Inspectors Armstrong & Tochi, S.F.P.D., RO contacted Mr. McNamara in his office at Union Oil Company. Mr. McNamara phoned the lab and requested Arthur Allen to come to his office. On Allen's arrival McNamara left. Prior to interviewing Allen it was decided the initial questioning of suspect would be conducted by Inspector Armstrong.

After identifying ourselves as police officers, Allen was notified by Armstrong that we were investigating the Zodiac murders. He was further advised that it had been brought to our attention by an unnamed informant that Allen was alleged to have made certain statements approximately 11 months prior to the first Zodiac murder, which, if true, were of an incriminating nature. Allen was then informed by Armstrong of the conversation Allen had with Donald Cheney in January, 1968, but Allen was not told who this conversation was supposed to have been with. Allen was asked if he recalled having had such a conversation with anyone and replied that he did not recall such a conversation. He was asked if he had read or heard of the Zodiac and he replied he had read about Zodiac when it first appeared in the newspapers. He stated after the initial reading he did not follow it any longer as he thought it was ""too morbid"". Allen later made other statements which were in direct conflict with this prior statement.

He volunteered the information that he had been questioned as a suspect by a Vallejo police sergeant after the Berryessa murder in Napa County. He stated on this particular weekend he had gone to a place called Salt Point Ranch near Fort Ross skin diving.

He went alone but stated he became acquainted with a serviceman and his wife who was stationed on Treasure Island. He did not recall this person's name but had it written down somewhere at home. He returned to Vallejo at approximately 4:00 p.m. and recalls talking to a neighbor shortly after he drove into his driveway. Allen stated he had neglected to inform the Vallejo officer who had talked to him about being seen by this neighbor at the time he was questioned. This neighbor, named White, died approximately a week after he was questioned so he never bothered to recontact the police.

Without any questioning regarding a knife, Allen made the following statement: ""The two knives I had in my car with blood on them, the blood came from a chicken I had killed"". He evidently of the opinion we had some information regarding a knife that we did not possess.

Writer researched VPD files and unable to locate any report where Allen had previously been questioned regarding being Zodiac suspect. Also contacted Sgt. Lynch and he does not recall having questioned Allen.

At a later point in interview Allen stated he had been in southern California at the approximate time as the Riverside murder in which Zodiac is a suspect. The information volunteered by Allen without prompting. He admitted to being interested in guns but claimed only hand guns he owned were 22 caliber.

During interview it was noted Allen was wearing an unusual looking watch. The watch was shown officers by Allen and the brand name of watch was ""Zodiac"". Above the brand name was the circle and cross

hairs such as used as a signature on notes written by Zodiac. Allen stated watch was given to him as a present from his mother approximately two years ago.
Allen expressed his willingness to assist investigators in any manner possible. Stated he wished the time would come when police officers were no longer referred to as ""Pigs"". Prior to terminating interview writer asked Allen if he could recall anyone whom he might have had a conversation with regarding Zodiac. He stated he might have had a conversation with Mr. Kidder or Mr. Tucker of the Vallejo Recreation Department while he was employed there, but he was not positive.

Allen also related having read a book in high school which made a lasting impression on him. He stated the title of the book was ""The Most Dangerous Game"". This book was made into a movie and concerns a man shipwrecked on an island and being hunted by another man ""like an animal"". In conversation with Cheney, Allen is alleged to have disuussed this story.

After interview with Allen, it was opinion of all three investigators that further investigation should be conducted.

8-4-71 11:30 AM With Inspector Toschi, RO contacted Ted Kidder, head of Greater Vallejo Recreation District, 395 Amador Street. Mr. Kidder was asked if he knew Arthur Allen and if he recalled ever having discussed the Zodiac case with him. Kidder stated to his knowledge he had never talked about the Zodiac with Allen. Allen was formerly employed by the Recreation District as a life guard and trampoline instructor. His employment had been terminated approximately five years ago because of Allen's association with small children. Mr. Kidder had received numerous complaints from concerned parents of various acts towards their children by Allen. No formal complaint was ever made to the police re-Allen's acts. Kidder further remarked that as recently as three weeks ago he had a discussion with Philip Tucker, General Supervisor, Recreation District, concerning Allen as being a suspect in Zodiac murders. This discussion came about primarily because of Allen's suspected possibility of being a sexual deviate towards children and physical description. Both parties considered him a ""loner"" type.

Philip Tucker was called to Mr. Kidder's office and questioned about any conversations he might have had with Allen concerning Zodiac. He recalled casual type conversations and on one such occasion Allen told him that he had been questioned by police as a suspect. Tucker remembered Allen having discussed a special light attached to a gun barrel so that a person could shoot accurately at night. On another occasion he and his wife had visited Allen in his home. Allen had

made the remark that he had something he would like to show them, Stated that he only showed this particular thing to ""very certain people"" or something to this effect. He then took from a grey metal box, located in his bedroom, a paper. This paper was hand printed and pertained to a person who had been committed to Atascadero State Hospital for molesting a child. It rambled on and on about this person having been betrayed by his attorney, using language of a legal nature or terminology. Also in this script were various symbols similar to those used by Zodiac in his coded messages. Symbols and code very neatly done. Tucker expressed a polite interest in paper but his wife showed genuine interest. She asked Allen if she might borrow the paper to study it but Allen refused to allow her to take the paper. He did promise to have a copy made to give her. This he never did.

Tucker was asked if, to his knowledge, Allen had an interest in guns. He stated that he did have and owned two hand guns, one a revolver and the other some type of automatic. He did not know the calibers and admitted he did not have abundant knowledge of guns himself. When Allen was questioned he did not admit owning or having owned an automatic weapon.

Also when Allen was questioned RO asked him if he had ever owned a 1965-66 brown Corvair. He replied in the negative. This the type of car described by survivor of Blue Rock Springs murder as being driven by responsible on night of Ferrin murder July 4, 1969. Tucker was asked if he had any knowledge of Allen ever having owned such a car.

Page 9
VALLEJO POLICE DEPARTMENT OFFICER'S REPORT concerning Zodiac Case No. 243 146
He stated that to his knowledge he had not, but that he, Tucker, had owned a brown 1964 Corvair. When asked if he had ever loaned this vehicle to Allen, Tucker stated he had not. At the time he had two cars, the Corvair and a Pontiac, Allen had used his Pontiac on occasion. At this particular time Tucker was living in Berkeley. In the summer of 1969 he had left the Corvair parked at the Richfield Service station at Nebraska and Broadway for a period of approximately two weeks in an attempt to sell it. Keys were left at the station. At this time Arthur Allen was employed at this service station as an attendant. The exact time car was left could not be recalled by Mr. Tucker other than it was mid-summer of 1969.

Tucker further stated that approximately three weeks prior he had been contacted by Karen Allen, sister-in-law of suspect, and requested to contact Allen re-seeking some type of psychiatric treatment. This was because of some recent involvement with a child that the family had received a complaint about. He stated he did talk to Allen in his home but apparently could not get through to him he needed help. Conversation ended by Tucker requesting Allen not to come around his home in the future and that their association had come to an end.

Officers unable to contact Mrs. Tucker re-what she might have recalled about the script she had seen at Allen's home on prior mentioned occasion as she works graveyard shift in an Oakland hospital. She will be contacted at a later date.

8-4-71 2:00 PM Karen Allen, sister-in-law of suspect, contacted at her place of employment and appointment made to have her come to the police department. On arrival she was advised as to the reasons we wished to talk to her and seemed surprised that Arthur Allen was suspected as possibly being the Zodiac. Mrs. Allen promised her assistance in any manner possible. She stated she and her husband were aware that Allen had some type of hangup regarding children but that she could not believe he could be Zodiac. Mrs. Allen stated Arthur hated women, had never had a serious relationship with a woman his own age. He resented her and had made threats against her as he thought she had come between him and her husband. According to Karen, Arthur was spoiled and pampered by his mother. Mother did his cooking, washed his clothes, cleaned up after him and gave him money. Mother paid for two automobiles and two boats. She further stated Arthur hated his mother and had often expressed this hatred in her presence.

Karen was shown various notes written by Zodiac to the newspapers. She could not recognize printing as being similar to suspect's but did relate that certain phrases were of the context that he would use. As an example, she stated he would use the phrase ""trigger mach"" instead of trigger mechanism. When she saw the Christmas card addressed to Melvin Belli spelled ""Mery Xmass"" Karen stated she definitely recalled having received a card at Christmas from Arthur in which Merry Xmas was spelled exactly the same way.

Karen stated Allen was left-handed, but when he was in school his teachers had attempted to convert him to right hand. He learned to write right-handed but soon reverted back to using his left hand.

Karen Allen is a WFA, 26, formerly taught school. Her husband, Ronald, is WMA, 32, landscape engineer. Appointment made to come to her home at 8:00 p.m. this date & discuss matter with her husband.

8:15 PM Inspectors Armstrong and Toschi and RO to 216 Aragon Street. Ron Allen promised all assistance possible in investigation but could not believe his brother could be a serious suspect in this case. Ron apparently had a sincere desire to assist but could offer little to either confirm or clear matter under investigation. He did say that he was well acquainted with our sources of information who had originally given statements to police indicating Arthur Leigh Allen was a prime suspect. Ron Allen stated they were responsible people who would not have made such statements if they were not true. He further stated that he had received a complaint from Cheney that his brother had made improper advances toward one of his children. This might be a motive why Cheney would make such an accusation against Arthur Allen. This is RO's observation and not Ronald Allen's.


Ronald had no knowledge of any notes possessed by his brother such as described by Tucker. He did have knowledge of a grey metal box in his brother's bedroom. Stated as far as he knew his brother owned two guns, both 22 caliber revolvers. Also of the opinion brother drank to excess and had a definite problem as far as children were concerned. Ronald stated if he could develop anything which might assist in investigation he would contact RO.

8-11-71 11:00 AM RO contacted Bob Luce, owner-operator of the Arco Service Station, 640 Broadway. Mr. Luce was informed we were conducting an investigation on a former employee but not informed as to what. He stated Allen had been employed by him on a part-time basis for approximately six months. He was undependable and had a drinking problem. Again the subject of children came up. He seemed to be too interested in small girls.

Work records show he was discharged in April 1969. Luce recalls Tucker having his car at his service station, but he does not think it was for a two-week period. In any event, this would seem to negate the possibility Allen could have used this particular car on July 4, 1969 as he was no longer employed by Luce and no one can recall the exact date vehicle was left at station.

Every one else has these buttons like, ☮, black power, melvin eats bluber, etc. Well it would cheer me up considerably if I saw a lot of people wearing my buton. Please no nasty ones like melvin's

 PATTERSON, CALIF.
Patterson Police Department — Reporting Dept.
 Code: 207 PC (Assist other agency)
 Classification of Crime: Kidnapping
 F.F.D. No.: 7425
Injured Party: Mrs. Kathleen Johns
 Phone: (714) 886-1151
 Address: 617 Campus Way, San Bernardino
 Date Committed: 3/22/70
 Means of Attack: See body of report
 Where Committed: Interstate 5, South Patterson
 Reported by: Mrs. Kathleen Johns
 Time Reported: 0230 hours a.m.
 Reported to: Sgt. Charles J. McNatt, P.D.
 Suspect: See body of report
COMPLETE DETAILS OF CRIME AND DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY
This investigation is being conducted by Sergeant Charles J. McNatt, Patterson Police Department. In an attempt to evaluate the circumstances surrounding the alleged kidnapping of Mrs. Kathleen Johns, 617 Campus Way, San Bernardino, California, and her 10-month-old daughter Jennifer, on Interstate 5, north of Patterson at about 2315 hours, 3/22/70.
On the morning of 23 March 1970, at about 0230 hours, Mrs. Kathleen Johns was brought to the Patterson Police Department in a hysterical condition. When Mrs. Johns was quieted it was learned from her that a car had followed her from Modesto on Highway 132, and began blinking the lights in an attempt to get her to stop which she refused to do. Mrs. Johns states that after she had entered Interstate 5 that the vehicle then passed her, and at this time she stopped to check her car and was flagged to the wrong side of the road by a male subject who had been following her, had stopped, and had backed up the freeway. The man got out and advised her that the wheel on her car was wobbling and that he would fix it for her, that he began to take off a tire wrench and appeared to be tightening the lug bolts on her left rear wheel. The man then got into his own car and drove off without saying anything. Mrs. Johns then got into her own car and as she started driving off the wheel came off her car, whereupon the subject came back and said he would drive her to a service station. Mrs. Johns then got her infant into the car with the subject and he drove her around for what seemed to be an hour and a half or more, driving on back roads and stopping and turning around several times. She said he kept mumbling about killing people and throwing their bodies out of cars, and that he told her he was going to kill her and throw her baby out after he did so.
She said nothing during the ride and that at one point she attempted to get away, and he said if she did he would kill her. After driving around for some time the suspect’s car stopped at an intersection and Mrs. Johns grabbed her baby and ran across a field, hiding in a ditch until she saw the suspect drive off. She then walked or hitchhiked approximately two miles to the nearest road where she was picked up by a passing motorist and brought to the Patterson Police Department.
Mrs. Johns described the suspect as a white male, approximately 30 years old, 5'9"" in height, 160 lbs., dark hair, dark complexion, wearing a dark windbreaker jacket and black slacks. She stated she could identify him if seen again.
Mrs. Johns described the suspect’s car as a late-model tan or light brown sedan, possibly a 1957 or 1958 Chevrolet, with a spotlight on the left front fender. She stated there were no license plates on the front or rear of the vehicle.
Investigation revealed that Mrs. Johns’ vehicle, a brown 1957 Chevrolet station wagon, had been located burned approximately two miles west of Interstate 5 and one mile north of Highway 132. The vehicle was completely destroyed by fire, with the lug bolts on the left rear wheel missing. Deputy Lovett of the San Joaquin County Sheriff’s Office stated that a preliminary investigation showed the fire to be of incendiary origin.
Mrs. Johns and her infant daughter were taken to the San Joaquin General Hospital for observation and later released.
Inspector Tyrell of the San Joaquin County Sheriff’s Office and the San Francisco Police Department were contacted regarding the possibility of this case being connected with the so-called “Zodiac” suspect who has been operating in Northern California. Inspector Tyrell asked that a full report be sent to his office.
DEPARTMENT OF POLICE — CITY OF PATTERSON
 P.O. Box 667 — Patterson, Ca. 95363
 Alex X. Kosch — Chief of Police
 Phone (209) 892-2031
By this department it was found that this was the first time the initial report from Mrs. Johns and that the report was to be sent to the Homicide Division, attention Inspector Armstrong and Inspector Toschi.
When this office made contact with Inspector Tyrell no names were mentioned, only the bulletin number and SFPD case number was used.
Burned vehicle was towed to Tracy on authority of the San Joaquin authorities who state that arson and kidnapping charges will be filed if and when the person is arrested.

Text: A jawbone (and all teeth) were found close to Interstate 80 and Highway 20, near Camp Spaulding in Placer County on December 31st 1985 (reported in the newspapers as 1986) by a fisherman traveling towards Lake Valley Reservoir via Yuba Gap. A human skull was found near to the other remains in January 1986 during follow-up searches headed by Deputy Lowell Carleton. These bones remained unidentified until December 2023, when it was finally determined through DNA to be that of Donna Lass, her fate unknown for almost 53 years and 4 months.

I told her that my car was down the street and that I would give her a lift home. When we were away from the library walking, I said it was about time. She asked me ""about time for what"". I said it was about time for her to die. I grabbed her around the neck with my hand over her mouth and my other hand with a small knife at her throat. She went very willingly. Her breast felt very warm and firm under my hands. But only one thing was on my mind. Making her pay for all the brush offs that she had given me during the years prior. She died hard. She squirmed and shook as I choaked her, and her lips twiched. She let out a scream once and I kicked her in the head to shut her up. I plunged the knife into her and it broke. I then finished the job by cutting her throat. I am not sick. I am insane. But that will not stop the game. This letter should be published for all to read it. It just might save that girl in the alley. But that's up to you. It will be on your conscience. Not mine. Yes I did make that call to you also. It was just a warning.

recqCmgTN8PuTiFGs,The Kathleen Johns incident,1970-03-22,83700,"recDImIEGwECs4V7G,recsQBauhNb75B4ga,recWwPBMTTBlgsqKU","On March 22, 1970, at approximately 11:15 PM, Kathleen Johns, a 22-year-old woman traveling with her 10-month-old daughter Jennifer, became involved in what would later be considered a possible Zodiac Killer encounter. This incident occurred on Highway 132 near Interstate 5 outside Patterson, California, approximately 72 miles east-southeast of Vallejo.
## The Abduction
According to Johns' report to the Patterson Police Department, she was driving from San Bernardino to Petaluma to visit her sick mother when a vehicle began following her, flashing its lights. After she pulled over, a man approached her car claiming her wheel was wobbling. He offered to tighten the lug bolts on her left rear wheel. After appearing to fix the problem, Johns attempted to drive away but discovered the wheel immediately fell off, secured by only one bolt.
The man then offered to drive Johns and her infant daughter to a service station. Once they entered his vehicle, however, he drove them around on back roads for approximately 1.5 hours. During this time, according to Johns' statement, the man mumbled about ""killing people and throwing their bodies out of cars"" and threatened to kill her and throw her baby out afterward.
## The Escape
When the vehicle stopped at an intersection, Johns seized the opportunity to escape. She grabbed her daughter and fled across a field, hiding in a ditch until she saw the suspect drive away. She then walked or hitchhiked approximately two miles to the nearest road where a passing motorist picked her up and brought her to the Patterson Police Department at around 2:30 AM.
## Police Investigation
Sergeant Charles J. McNatt of the Patterson Police Department documented Johns' arrival in a ""hysterical condition."" Johns described her abductor as a white male, approximately 30 years old, 5'9"" tall, 160 pounds, with dark hair and complexion, wearing a dark windbreaker jacket and black slacks. She stated she could identify him if seen again.
Johns' vehicle, a brown 1957 Chevrolet station wagon, was later found completely destroyed by fire approximately two miles west of Interstate 5 and one mile north of Highway 132. Investigation revealed the lug bolts on the left rear wheel were missing, and the fire appeared to be of incendiary origin.
## Connection to the Zodiac Killer
While at the police station, Johns reportedly noticed a wanted poster with a composite sketch of the Zodiac Killer and identified him as her abductor. The San Francisco Police Department was contacted regarding the possible connection to the Zodiac case.
On July 24, 1970, the Zodiac Killer sent a letter to the San Francisco Chronicle in which he claimed responsibility for the incident, writing that he had ""a little list"" of victims which included ""the woman + her baby that I gave a rather interesting ride for a coupple howers one evening a few months back that ended in my burning her car where I found them.""
## Perspectives on the Case
The connection between Johns' abduction and the Zodiac Killer remains debated among investigators:
- **Supporting evidence**: The Zodiac's own claim of responsibility in his July 24 letter; Johns' identification of the composite sketch; the proximity to other Zodiac activity; and the threatening behavior consistent with the Zodiac's pattern.
- **Skeptical view**: Some investigators question the reliability of Johns' identification and note inconsistencies in her account. The location was also farther east than the Zodiac's confirmed attacks, which were concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area.

The Kathleen Johns incident remains one of the most significant potential Zodiac encounters where the victim survived to provide a detailed account. Johns died of a heart attack in 2002, and the case continues to be studied as part of the broader Zodiac investigation.

COMPLETE DETAILS OF CRIME AND DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY
This investigation is being conducted by Sergeant Charles J. McNatt, Patterson Police Department. In an attempt to evaluate the circumstances surrounding the alleged kidnapping of Mrs. Kathleen Johns, 617 Campus Way, San Bernardino, California, and her 10-month-old daughter Jennifer, on Interstate 5, north of Patterson at about 2315 hours, 3/22/70.
On the morning of 23 March 1970, at about 0230 hours, Mrs. Kathleen Johns was brought to the Patterson Police Department in a hysterical condition. When Mrs. Johns was quieted it was learned from her that a car had followed her from Modesto on Highway 132, and began blinking the lights in an attempt to get her to stop which she refused to do. Mrs. Johns states that after she had entered Interstate 5 that the vehicle then passed her, and at this time she stopped to check her car and was flagged to the wrong side of the road by a male subject who had been following her, had stopped, and had backed up the freeway. The man got out and advised her that the wheel on her car was wobbling and that he would fix it for her, that he began to take off a tire wrench and appeared to be tightening the lug bolts on her left rear wheel. The man then got into his own car and drove off without saying anything. Mrs. Johns then got into her own car and as she started driving off the wheel came off her car, whereupon the subject came back and said he would drive her to a service station. Mrs. Johns then got her infant into the car with the subject and he drove her around for what seemed to be an hour and a half or more, driving on back roads and stopping and turning around several times. She said he kept mumbling about killing people and throwing their bodies out of cars, and that he told her he was going to kill her and throw her baby out after he did so.
She said nothing during the ride and that at one point she attempted to get away, and he said if she did he would kill her. After driving around for some time the suspect’s car stopped at an intersection and Mrs. Johns grabbed her baby and ran across a field, hiding in a ditch until she saw the suspect drive off. She then walked or hitchhiked approximately two miles to the nearest road where she was picked up by a passing motorist and brought to the Patterson Police Department.
Mrs. Johns described the suspect as a white male, approximately 30 years old, 5'9"" in height, 160 lbs., dark hair, dark complexion, wearing a dark windbreaker jacket and black slacks. She stated she could identify him if seen again.
Mrs. Johns described the suspect’s car as a late-model tan or light brown sedan, possibly a 1957 or 1958 Chevrolet, with a spotlight on the left front fender. She stated there were no license plates on the front or rear of the vehicle.
Investigation revealed that Mrs. Johns’ vehicle, a brown 1957 Chevrolet station wagon, had been located burned approximately two miles west of Interstate 5 and one mile north of Highway 132. The vehicle was completely destroyed by fire, with the lug bolts on the left rear wheel missing. Deputy Lovett of the San Joaquin County Sheriff’s Office stated that a preliminary investigation showed the fire to be of incendiary origin.
Mrs. Johns and her infant daughter were taken to the San Joaquin General Hospital for observation and later released.
Inspector Tyrell of the San Joaquin County Sheriff’s Office and the San Francisco Police Department were contacted regarding the possibility of this case being connected with the so-called “Zodiac” suspect who has been operating in Northern California. Inspector Tyrell asked that a full report be sent to his office.
DEPARTMENT OF POLICE — CITY OF PATTERSON
 P.O. Box 667 — Patterson, Ca. 95363
 Alex X. Kosch — Chief of Police
 Phone (209) 892-2031
By this department it was found that this was the first time the initial report from Mrs. Johns and that the report was to be sent to the Homicide Division, attention Inspector Armstrong and Inspector Toschi.
When this office made contact with Inspector Tyrell no names were mentioned, only the bulletin number and SFPD case number was used.
Burned vehicle was towed to Tracy on authority of the San Joaquin authorities who state that arson and kidnapping charges will be filed if and when the person is arrested.

Complainant stated she stopped her vehicle, a 1957 Chevrolet S/W bearing Calif. Lic. HOU 518, somewhere in the area of Hwy. 132 and Interstate 5. She advised that the exact area is unfamiliar to her and that she was not sure where the vehicle had been stopped.
Complainant stated that a WMA, approx. 30 yrs., 5’9”, 160 lbs., dark hair, wearing blk. rimmed plastic glasses, wearing a dark jacket and dark trousers, blue bell-bottomed pants, approached her vehicle and advised her that her left rear wheel of her vehicle was wobbling and that he would repair the malfunction. Complainant stated she stayed in her vehicle and observed the suspect tighten the lug nuts of the rear tire of her vehicle and upon completion then advised her the wheel was okay at this time and that she could proceed. The complainant then observed the suspect pull away from the roadway and across the area.
Complainant stated she started her vehicle and was attempting to pull away from the curb when the vehicle came to a lurching stop at which time she exited the vehicle in an attempt to ascertain what the problem was. She discovered that the left rear wheel had fallen off the vehicle and it had only been secured by one lug bolt. She stated at that time she observed the suspect return in his vehicle and he advised her he would transport her to a service station in order to have the vehicle repaired. The complainant entered the suspect’s vehicle carrying her small daughter, approx. 10 mos., and left the area under the pretense that the suspect was attempting to locate a service station.
Complainant stated the suspect drove around in the County area, possibly near Tracy, for approx. one and a half hours and would not allow her to leave his vehicle. She stated at one time he said, “I’m going to kill you and throw your baby out after you.” Complainant stated that beyond that, the suspect made no sexual advances toward her and merely eluded the question of stating anything further.
She was quite frightened, feeling that possibly the suspect intended to do some physical injury to her and that when the suspect stopped at a stop sign, she grabbed her daughter and ran away from the car into the fields and hid until she saw a passing motorist, who transported her to the Patterson Police Department.
Complainant stated the suspect’s vehicle was light tan in color, possibly a 1957 or 1958 Chevrolet, with one spotlight on the left front fender, and there were no license plates on the vehicle.
The person transporting the complainant were not present upon this writer’s arrival, therefore their names remain unknown at this time.
Complainant advised that she was not injured during the incident, nor her daughter had not been harmed.

SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT 1
Case No. 70-7475 – Page 2
A mile ahead of them, a vehicle pulled to the side of the road. The driver got out and attempted to flag them down. This incident took place near Highways 33 and 132.
Neither of these subjects could provide a description of the driver of this white 1959 Buick.
According to Sergeant Hall of Stanislaus County Sheriff’s Office, witnesses Horton and Beaman had read an article in the paper regarding the kidnap of victim Kathleen Johns, and after reading it decided to report this incident to the Sheriff’s Office, since it apparently took place in the same general area as the Johns case.
The Stanislaus County Sheriff’s Office did not make a separate report; this information was obtained from Sgt. Hall.
The undersigned, along with Detective McKay of the Stanislaus County Sheriff’s Office, made contact at witness Frederick Beaman’s residence, 300 Kerr Street, Modesto. His mother, Mrs. Teresa Watson, advised that her son had been gone from the residence since Sunday evening, March 22, 1970, and she had not heard from him since.
She stated her son was supposed to be staying with a friend, Bill Horton, but she had no additional information about his whereabouts. A business card was left with Mrs. Watson, who said she would have her son contact this office or report to Stockton personally.
Signed: Dep. Ambrose
SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT 1
Case No. 70-7475 – Page 3
Officers attempted to make contact with witness William Horton but received no response at his residence.
They then proceeded to Reed and Son Tow Service in Tracy to search for the victim’s vehicle, a 1957 Chevrolet, California license HOU 518, in an attempt to locate keys. Officer Palm advised he had observed no keys inside the car shortly after the fire was extinguished.
Undersigned made contact with Mr. Reed, owner of Reed and Son Tow Service. He stated he did not see any keys in the vehicle when it was towed from Highway 132, just east of Bird Road.
Mr. Reed advised that the right rear wheel had only two lug bolts in it, and both were very loose. He took two lug bolts from the right front wheel and put them on the rear wheel before towing the vehicle to his shop.
He further advised that on March 23, 1970, a man and woman had come to his shop inquired about the victim’s vehicle (the 1957 Chevrolet station wagon, California license HOU 518). He assumed they were the owners.
Signed: Dep. Ambrose
SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT 1
Case No. 70-7475 – Page 4
Mrs. Johns stated the suspect had gone down the road a short distance, made a U-turn, and returned. He offered to drive her and her baby to a service station to get help.
The suspect went west on Highway 132 and pulled into a Richfield station, believed to be on Chrisman Road. It was closed. The suspect then drove around approximately one and a half hours in rural areas.
Mrs. Johns said they came into a lighted city, which she believed was Tracy. She told the suspect she was frightened and wanted to get out, but he said, “This isn’t the right one.”
He drove her back into the rural area, and when they came to a stop sign, she grabbed her baby and ran away across a field into an embankment in the dark. She said the suspect turned off his lights, waited about five minutes, then turned them back on and left the area.
She then made it to a roadway or highway (unsure which), where she was picked up by some people from Missouri who took her to Patterson.
Signed: Dep. Ambrose
SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT 1
Case No. 70-7475 – Page 5
Since there was no police department in the area, she was taken to Patterson PD, who notified Stanislaus County.
Deputy Lovett returned to the scene to locate the vehicle. It was still smoldering when he arrived.
He noted the right rear wheel had one lug bolt tight, one loose, and three missing. The hubcap was gone.
A hubcap was later located nearby, believed identical to the missing one. It was collected for latent prints and returned to Reed and Son Tow Service.
Country Club Fire Department was notified; they contacted the rural fire department in Tracy for arson investigation.
Deputy Lovett could not determine by smell whether the fire was arson due to a cold.
Mrs. Johns agreed to leave her car for examination, having no insurance.
Signed: Dep. Ambrose
SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT 1
Case No. 70-7475 – Page 6
Mrs. Johns was traveling from her home in San Bernardino County to San Francisco. At this time she was in Patterson, with no funds or friends and awaiting further investigation.
According to Deputy Lovett, Mrs. Johns never stated she asked to be let out of the vehicle, nor did she say the suspect forced her to stay. It is unclear whether she was detained against her will.
Mrs. Johns also told Deputy Lovett the suspect reminded her of the pictures she had seen of the “Zodiac Killer.” She said he made strange remarks, including when she asked, “Do you help many people on the road?” and he replied, “By the time I get through with them, they won’t need any help.”
No further action taken.
Bulletin received from San Francisco (Inspectors Armstrong & Toschi) referencing Crime Report 69-6314, Warrant Bulletin 9069. Stanislaus County requested a copy of this report.

On the night of March 22, 1970, 22-year-old Kathleen Johns was traveling from San Bernardino to San Francisco when she encountered a potentially life-threatening situation.\n\nIncident Details:\nAround 11:15 PM, a late-model tan sedan began following Johns, repeatedly flashing its lights. When she stopped, a man approached her, claiming her left rear wheel was wobbling. He appeared to help her by manipulating the wheel's lug nuts. After driving away briefly, Johns discovered her wheel had been deliberately loosened, causing her car to become unstable.\n\nThe suspect returned and offered to drive her to a service station. During the subsequent drive, which lasted approximately 90 minutes, Johns reported the man made disturbing statements about killing people and throwing their bodies from vehicles. At one point, he allegedly told her, \""By the time I get through with them, they won't need any help.\""\n\nSuspect Description:\n- White male, approximately 30 years old\n- 5'9\"" tall, 160 lbs\n- Dark hair, dark complexion\n- Wearing a dark windbreaker and black slacks\n- Possibly wearing black-rimmed glasses\n\nEscape and Aftermath:\nWhen the vehicle stopped at an intersection, Johns seized an opportunity to escape. She grabbed her 10-month-old daughter and ran across a field, hiding in a ditch until the suspect departed. She was subsequently picked up by passing motorists and brought to the Patterson Police Department.\n\nHer vehicle, a brown 1957 Chevrolet station wagon, was found burned approximately two miles from the incident location. Investigators determined the fire was of incendiary origin.\n\nZodiac Connection:\nThe incident gained significant attention in the Zodiac Killer investigation. Johns herself noted the suspect resembled photographs she had seen of the Zodiac Killer. The Zodiac Killer later claimed credit for the abduction in his communications.\n\nControversy and Debate:\nWhile some investigators consider the incident a confirmed Zodiac attack, others remain skeptical. Michael Butterfield, a Zodiac researcher, has expressed doubts about the direct connection.\n\nIdentification Attempts:\nIn later investigations, Johns identified Lawrence Kane, a suspect, in a photo lineup as potentially being her abductor.\n\nThe Kathleen Johns incident remains a complex and unresolved chapter in the Zodiac Killer's notorious criminal history, representing one of the many mysterious encounters attributed to the unidentified serial killer.""}","{""isStale"": true, ""state"": ""generated"", ""value"": ""# The Kathleen Johns Incident\n\nOn March 22, 1970, at approximately 11:15 PM, Kathleen Johns, a 22-year-old woman traveling with her 10-month-old daughter Jennifer, became involved in what would later be considered a possible Zodiac Killer encounter. This incident occurred on Highway 132 near Interstate 5 outside Patterson, California, approximately 72 miles east-southeast of Vallejo.\n\n## The Abduction\n\nAccording to Johns' report to the Patterson Police Department, she was driving from San Bernardino to Petaluma to visit her sick mother when a vehicle began following her, flashing its lights. After she pulled over, a man approached her car claiming her wheel was wobbling. He offered to tighten the lug bolts on her left rear wheel. After appearing to fix the problem, Johns attempted to drive away but discovered the wheel immediately fell off, secured by only one bolt.\n\nThe man then offered to drive Johns and her infant daughter to a service station. Once they entered his vehicle, however, he drove them around on back roads for approximately 1.5 hours. During this time, according to Johns' statement, the man mumbled about \""killing people and throwing their bodies out of cars\"" and threatened to kill her and throw her baby out afterward.\n\n## The Escape\n\nWhen the vehicle stopped at an intersection, Johns seized the opportunity to escape. She grabbed her daughter and fled across a field, hiding in a ditch until she saw the suspect drive away. She then walked or hitchhiked approximately two miles to the nearest road where a passing motorist picked her up and brought her to the Patterson Police Department at around 2:30 AM.\n\n## Police Investigation\n\nSergeant Charles J. McNatt of the Patterson Police Department documented Johns' arrival in a \""hysterical condition.\"" Johns described her abductor as a white male, approximately 30 years old, 5'9\"" tall, 160 pounds, with dark hair and complexion, wearing a dark windbreaker jacket and black slacks. She stated she could identify him if seen again.\n\nJohns' vehicle, a brown 1957 Chevrolet station wagon, was later found completely destroyed by fire approximately two miles west of Interstate 5 and one mile north of Highway 132. Investigation revealed the lug bolts on the left rear wheel were missing, and the fire appeared to be of incendiary origin.\n\n## Connection to the Zodiac Killer\n\nWhile at the police station, Johns reportedly noticed a wanted poster with a composite sketch of the Zodiac Killer and identified him as her abductor. The San Francisco Police Department was contacted regarding the possible connection to the Zodiac case.\n\nOn July 24, 1970, the Zodiac Killer sent a letter to the San Francisco Chronicle in which he claimed responsibility for the incident, writing that he had \""a little list\"" of victims which included \""the woman + her baby that I gave a rather interesting ride for a coupple howers one evening a few months back that ended in my burning her car where I found them.\""\n\n## Perspectives on the Case\n\nThe connection between Johns' abduction and the Zodiac Killer remains debated among investigators:\n\n- **Supporting evidence**: The Zodiac's own claim of responsibility in his July 24 letter; Johns' identification of the composite sketch; the proximity to other Zodiac activity; and the threatening behavior consistent with the Zodiac's pattern.\n\n- **Skeptical view**: Some investigators question the reliability of Johns' identification and note inconsistencies in her account. The location was also farther east than the Zodiac's confirmed attacks, which were concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nThe Kathleen Johns incident remains one of the most significant potential Zodiac encounters where the victim survived to provide a detailed account. Johns died of a heart attack in 2002, and the case continues to be studied as part of the broader Zodiac investigation, which remains unsolved.""}","{""errorType"": ""emptyDependency"", ""isStale"": false, ""state"": ""error"", ""value"": null}",2026-02-15T17:19:09.000Z,true,"Modesto, CA, Hwy 132, Patterson, CA",the-kathleen-johns-incident,40,recqCmgTN8PuTiFGs,,,

Text: Sirs—I would like to expression my consternt consternation concerning your poor taste & lack of sympathy for the public, as evidenced by your running of the ads for the movie ""Badlands,"" featuring the blurb—""In 1959 most people were killing time. Kit & Holly were killing people."" In light of recent events, this kind of murder-glorification can only be deplorable at best (not that glorification of violence was ever justifiable) why don't you show some concern for public sensibilities & cut the ad?

Text: Unabomber fallout Hits Berkeley
Locals profit from arrest of former UC prof
By Matt Segal
March 11, 1996 - Berkeley Voice
First there was OJ. and now there's TJ.
Theodore J. Kaczynski, that is. He is, of course, the former UC Berkeley mathematics professor whom federal authorities believe is the Unabomber. And his legend is speeding across Berkeley faster than a white Ford Bronco on an L. A. freeway.
Take Seewantee Keislar, for example, who didn't realize until last week that she was living in a landmark. That's when reporters from around the Bay Area and all over the country started calling her. They begged to come onto her property, take a photo of her house, squeeze any bit of information out of her they could.
Keislar has the misfortune of being co-owner of the tri-plex at 2626 Regent St. The cottage in the back, labeled 2628A Regent street, was at one point the home of Kaczynski. The address listing is in the 1967-68 campus directory. It was the young professor's first year at Berkeley. He had just received a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan.
But Keislar has told reporter and anybody else who has come calling that she and her husband, Allan, bought the property in 1992 from the Krishna Copy Center. None of the parties know anything about the Unabomber. But that hasn't stopped requests for interviews and pictures. Keislar, who is also pregnant, said one television reporter cursed and threatened to hit her when she asked him to stay off her property.
So now Keislar has taken some dramatic measures. First, she contacted her husband, who is currently in Pakistan, and explained to him about the phone calls and the unexpected visitors. Next, she retained Berkeley attorney Jim Chanin to help keep people away. And lastly, she decided to charge $500 for each photograph taken on her property.
She said more that one news organization 'ready has all ready taken
her up on that offer, although she declined to name names. ""Several people, because they wanted pictures, she explained. Chanin was not available for comment this week, but his law associate Sue Ochs confirmed that Keislar called their office seeking counsel.
“He (Chanin) wants to prevent her from being harassed,"" Ochs said. The news organizations are doing their stories and that's all well and good, but there has to be a balance. She did call here and was very distraught.""
Regent Street isn't the only place in Berkeley where the fever has struck. Berkeley-based Jolly Roger press, which published the Unabomber's manifesto in book from last year, has been swamped with requests for additional copies.
""People are calling and want hundreds of books. It really has picked up,"" said Jolly Roger spokesperson Johanna Seppalainen.
Jolly Roger has taken orders in the last week for more than 1,000 copies of the manifesto, which went to a second printing in January. Distributors in San Francisco,
New Jersey, and even England have asked for large quantities. Individuals have also called requesting single copies. Seppalainen said that Jolly Roger's owner, Kris Lawson, who is away in Hong Kong will probably be stunned. ""He may not even know the Unabomber is caught. I'm sure he will be very surprised to come home and find out we've sold so many books.” If you live in the East Bay though, it's hard to imagine not knowing that a suspect is in custody.
Newspapers, radio, and television have all made the Unabomber their top story since Kaczlrnski's arrest. The UC mathematics department, where Kaczynski taught until 1969, has received an estimated 75 to 100 calls about the former professor. '""They have been pushy, some of them have been pushy,” said Marsha Snow, a math department student services assistant. Snow said things calmed down a bit after a press
conference was held by the mathematics department and the university last Thursday.
About 100 media organizations jammed the Madrone Room at the student union to hear Kaczynski's former colleagues explain how the suspect had once refused to go out for pizza and beer after speaking at a local mathematics seminar.
Tom Goldstein, dean of .UC Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism, said the media hype reminds him of the spectacle surrounding serial killer Son of Sam in New York during the 1970s. Goldstein was a reporter for the New York Times as that story developed. ""You have to balance trying to find out as much as you can about this person who is only a suspect and the public's appetite for information,"" Goldstein said. ""There's a ghoulish aspect to it... It's regrettable to see this whole thing exploited.""

In this interview it was learned that they were hunting in the area from 9:00PM to 11:00PM. 11:00PM was approximate, because [redacted] looked at his watch and he knew it was in the area of 11:00PM. It could have been five minutes to the hour or ten minutes to. It took them three or four minutes, possibly five minutes to get back to their truck, walking up the road on the

They described the light colored 1960 Rambler S/W that was parked at the gate. It was parked Southwest of where we finally found the car. This discrepancy wasn't noted at first.

[redacted] remembers looking at his watch around 11:00 PM or five or ten minutes before and they headed back towards the car. He said it took them about 10 minutes to walk back to the truck. He was at the truck about a total of 5 minutes and a car came in, that has been identified as MRS [redacted]'S, it drove in, turned around and drove back in the opposite direction towards Benicia, again. He states that approximately 5 minutes later they drove in his truck a '59 Chevrolet, red in color, with white wood sideboards, cattle guards, on the sides. They drove this truck back to the Gasser Ranch heading towards Benicia and they passed the car. [redacted] insists that the Rambler was parked on the bank. That would be on the South side. He did not see any person in the car. He estimates he left the area between 11:00 and 11:15PM. He remained at the Gasser's house about an hour and then left out through Highway #21, through the Jamison Canyon and headed home, arriving about 12:30AM.

[redacted] was asked if he had a rifle. He stated that he had a automatic rifle. The RO advised [redacted] of his constitutional rights at this time. Due to the fact that he was in the area and he did have a rifle which he claimed he

had with him that night. He was given a receipt for the rifle. The rifle was tested at the S/O by Rangemaster George Parks. On the basis of the findings of George Parks this rifle has been eliminated as a suspected weapon. [redacted] states that FRANK GASSER does own an automatic rifle but that he doesn't have it at the house. He suggested that we call or see a gentleman by the name of HARLAN [redacted] who lives at 106 Marquis Avenue. It is possible that the gun is there, because GASSER does not leave his guns at the ranch because of recent thefts. [redacted]'s car has California license D-26024.

recyjFt6i09xmtq46,Stella Medeiros finds bodies,1968-12-20,83700,rec9eYWhCQCUgaGyg,"On December 20, 1968, at approximately 11:15 PM, Stella Medeiros (née Borges) was driving on Lake Herman Road with her mother-in-law and daughter when she discovered the bodies of David Faraday and Betty Lou Jensen. 

Key details:
\- Medeiros was en route to pick up her 13-year-old son from a movie theater
\- She spotted a 1961 Rambler station wagon parked near the pumping station entrance
\- David Faraday appeared to have ""fallen out of the open door"" of the vehicle
\- Betty Lou Jensen was lying on her side facing the road, wearing a purple dress
\- Medeiros immediately drove to Benicia and flagged down a police officer to report the bodies

Significance:
This discovery marked the first moments after the Lake Herman Road murders, a pivotal event in the Zodiac Killer case. Medeiros's quick action alerted authorities to the crime scene, initiating the investigation into the double homicide of two teenagers.


> “At 11:15 p.m., local resident Stella Borges   drove past the entrance to the pumping station on her way to pick up her son from a movie theater. As her headlights came upon the turnout, she and the other passengers in her car saw the bodies of the two teenagers on the ground. David “looked like he had fallen out of the open door” of his station wagon.
> 
> Betty was farther away, lying on her side and facing the road. Concluding that something was terribly wrong, Stella continued into Benicia as fast as possible. Once there, she quickly spotted a police officer, attracted his attention, and reported what she’d seen.”

Excerpt From
The Zodiac Revisited, Volume 1: The Facts of the Case
Cole, Michael

> Benicia resident Stella Medeiros was on her way to pick up her 13-year-old daughter, and she was accompanied by her other daughter as well as her mother-in-law. They traveled along Lake Herman Road and the headlights suddenly revealed the Rambler station wagon parked near the pumping station entrance. The vehicle spotted by James Owen was gone. Stella could see the body of a young boy on the ground by the passenger side of the Rambler and the body of a young girl lying near the road.

In this interview it was learned that they were hunting in the area from 9:00PM to 11:00PM. 11:00PM was approximate, because [redacted] looked at his watch and he knew it was in the area of 11:00PM. It could have been five minutes to the hour or ten minutes to. It took them three or four minutes, possibly five minutes to get back to their truck, walking up the road on the

They claimed that they left the area several minutes after [redacted], who established the time as 11:20, that they left the scene. They described the light colored 1960 Rambler S/W that was parked at the gate. It was parked Southwest of where we finally found the car. This discrepancy wasn't noted at first.

MR [redacted] was asked to pin-point his activies closer on that day. He states that he went to the Gasser Ranch at approximately 6:00PM. They sat around awhile and didn't leave until several hours later. They arrived in the area of the pump station around 9:00PM. They parked the car about 25 feet inside of the Marshall Ranch property off of the road. They walked the creek towards the pump station. They had the dogs loose and they treed either a cat or a racoon in the area of the Dotta Ranch. While they were there they saw some sort of activity up there, all the lights were on, but they were a little distance away and couldn't tell what the activity was. The dogs treed a racoon in an oak tree near the Pump Station. The racoon was shot with

a long barrell .22 revolver. [partially illegible]
[redacted] remembers looking at his watch around 11:00 PM or five or ten minutes before and they headed back towards the car. He said it took them about 10 minutes to walk back to the truck. He was at the truck about a total of 5 minutes and a car came in, that has been identified as MRS [redacted]'S, it drove in, turned around and drove back in the opposite direction towards Benicia, again. He states that approximately 5 minutes later they drove in his truck a '59 Chevrolet, red in color, with white wood sideboards, cattle guards, on the sides. They drove this truck back to the Gasser Ranch heading towards Benicia and they passed the car. [redacted] insists that the Rambler was parked on the bank. That would be on the South side. He did not see any person in the car. He estimates he left the area between 11:00 and 11:15PM. He remained at the Gasser's house about an hour and then left out through Highway #21, through the Jamison Canyon and headed home, arriving about 12:30AM.

[redacted] was asked if he had a rifle. He stated that he had a automatic rifle. The RO advised [redacted] of his constitutional rights at this time. Due to the fact that he was in the area and he did have a rifle which he claimed he

had with him that night. He was given a receipt for the rifle. The rifle was tested at the S/O by Rangemaster George Parks. On the basis of the findings of George Parks this rifle has been eliminated as a suspected weapon. [redacted] states that FRANK GASSER does own an automatic rifle but that he doesn't have it at the house. He suggested that we call or see a gentleman by the name of HARLAN [redacted] who lives at 106 Marquis Avenue. It is possible that the gun is there, because GASSER does not leave his guns at the ranch because of recent thefts. [redacted]'s car has California license D-26024.

12-20-68 11:25 P.M. The reporting officers while on routine patrol were flagged down on the Lake Herman Road located on East 2nd Street, Benicia, California, north of Interstate 80, by Mrs. Stella Borges who advised that there were two bodies laying alongside the road on Lake Herman Road, just east of the Lake Herman Cottage.
12-20-68 11:23 P.M. The reporting officers arrived at Gate #10, leading south from Lake Herman Road to the interior near Faraday’s station wagon. This gate is located approximately one and a half miles east of the Lake Herman Cottage. Upon alighting from the patrol unit, the reporting officers discovered a white female lying face down in a pool of blood, which was located on the north (left) side of the road shoulder. A short distance away, near the right rear wheel of the station wagon, was a white male subject lying on the ground. A 1961 Rambler station wagon was found parked on the right shoulder of the road, facing west. The male victim (2) was lying beside the left rear wheel of the Rambler with his head to the west. The victim was unconscious but breathing with a large gunshot wound located on the back of the head and blood oozing from his left ear and mouth. The victim was placed in the patrol unit and rushed to Vallejo Community Hospital, arriving at approximately 11:45 P.M., where he was pronounced dead upon arrival by Dr. J. Byron Sandiford and Dr. J.

The female victim was lying 28 feet north from the rear of the Rambler, lying on her right side with her head to the west. Examination of the victim revealed five (5) small caliber gunshot wounds in her back. These wounds appeared to have been inflicted by a small caliber pistol, as no exit wounds were apparent.
The male victim was found beside the right front door of the Rambler. Examination revealed a gunshot wound located behind the left ear. The bullet was not visible. Examination of the Rambler revealed that the right front door was open.
A check of the area was made in regards to a weapon, which proved negative.
(Cont’d – Page #2)
The interior of the above vehicle was such that the right front door was standing open and the other three doors closed and locked. The front seat back had been let down into a reclining position. The right rear window had a hole which appeared to have been made by a bullet, with the entire glass shattered, and there was found a hole to the rear of the left rear wheel housing, which appeared to have been made by a bullet.
The scene was then photographed, the entire scene and all evidence found by the reporting officers, along with the photos, was turned over to Solano County Coroner Horn and Sergeant Lunblad, Solano County Sheriff’s Office, for proper disposition.
There was no disturbance of the crime scene except the removal of Victim #2, and prior to his removal a chalk outline of his body was made by Officer Warner.

RO went to location and contacted shooting victim, Michael Mageau. Was advised by Dr. Scott that RO could talk to him for a short time, however he was under medication at this time and would possibly be going to sleep shortly. RO contacted Michael who still was in very bad condition and was very strained to talk as he had had a wound in his mouth. RO asked him if he could as best as possible relate the facts as he knew them as to the occurrences of Friday night when he and D. FERRIN were shot. Michael states that he would do his best to give a statement and gave it as following.
States that at approximately 4:00p.m. Friday afternoon, that D. Ferrin called him up, and in their conversation stated they agreed that they would go to a movie in San Francisco that night and she would be at the house at approximately 7:30 p.m. Michael states he next heard from her at approximately 8:00p.m. when she again called and stated that she had to go with her sister, Christine, to the Miss Firecracker contest, that she would call him as soon as she could, as soon as she was clear from this. Michael states that he stayed home and at approx. 10:30 he received another call from Dea stating she would be over shortly. He stated that Dea came over at approximately 11:30 or shortly thereafter and picked him up in her car. They were both hungry as they had not had supper and were going to go get something to eat. Stated that she was driving her vehicle, the Corvair they were found in. Stated they drove west on Springs Road and as they were driving down Springs Road to go get something to eat, Dea stated to him that she wanted to talk to him about something. Michael stated that approximately at the location of Mr. Ed's on Springs Road they turned around and headed east at his suggestion to go to Blue Rock Springs Park where they could talk. They went directly out to this location, pulled the car in the parking lot where it was found by the police. Dea turned the lights and the motor off and had the radio playing. States they were there just a very short time, a few minutes, and three cars pulled in to the parking lot where they were. They were apparently young kids, and they heard some laughing and carrying on and a few firecrackers were set off, then the three vehicles left within a short time. This was just a very short space of time, a few minutes. Shortly after this and about five minutes before the shooting occurred, Michael states a vehicle pulled into the lot, coming from the direction of Springs Road and Vallejo. The driver turned the lights off on the car and pulled around to the left or east side of their car, approximately six or eight feet away and sat there for a minute. Michael states he asked Ded if she knew who it was and she stated, ""Oh, never mind."" Michael stated at this time he is always kidding Dea about knowing so many people and does not know whether she meant this as she knew the fellow or not. Michael states as best as he can recall, he could not see the car too clearly, however the shape of the car looked similar to the car that Dea owns, a Corvair. He could not see the color or anything as it was very dark out there.

States as far as he could tell this car had one male subject in it. The car then drove off and headed in the direction of Vallejo & Springs Road at a fairly fast rate of speed. He stated approximately five minutes later, the vehicle pulled up, coming from the direction of Vallejo & Springs Road. This vehicle pulled up approximately ten feet behind and to the right side of Dea's car, which would be the side that Michael was sitting. The vehicle's lights were left on and the subject got out and walked toward the car. He had a large high-powered flashlight, the kind you carry with a handle. This subject walked up to the car and Michael stated that both he and Dea believed that it was a policeman and that he wanted to check their I.D. or something. Stated subject stepped up to Michael's side of the car, which is the right side, shining the flashlight on them. Subject did not say anything to them, nor did they say anything to him. Michael stated he started to reach for his wallet as he felt it was a policeman who wanted to see his I.D. States as he did so, he heard a muffled sound and felt a pain in his back and his neck area. He states he heard some more muffled sounds, sounding like a gun with a silencer on it, and felt pains in his body, his back and around his neck. States he tried to climb over the back seat to get away from the shooting and subject kept shooting him again and again. States finally the subject quit shooting him and apparently turned the gun on Dea and started shooting her again and again. States subject then turned around and started to walk back to his vehicle which still had the headlights on. Michael stated he could not tell if he meant to yell at the subject or if he just yelled from pain, but he let out some type of yell. At this time, the subject apparently hearing him, came back to the car and shot Michael two more times, once in the back and once in the left leg. States the subject then turned the gun on Dea and shot her twice more. Michael states that all the shots that he heard were muffled, sounding similar to a gun with the silencer on. It was not loud. States the subject then turned around and casually walked back to his vehicle and got in. Michael at this time stated that he had to reach outside the car door to open it as the handle inside was broken. Stated he reached outside and opened the car door and fell outside on the ground. As he fell out onto the ground the vehicle the subject was in backed up in a turning movement and then took off toward Springs Road in Vallejo at a very high rate of speed. Michael states as the vehicle drove off he only saw the rear portion of it, this rear part appearing to be a vehicle similar to or the same type as Dea's car, a Corvair. Also a very similar color, possibly a little bit lighter brown. It had a California license, however he could not tell what the numbers were. Stated the subject continued on Blue Rock Springs Road at a very high rate of speed towards Springs Road in Vallejo.

and he asked them to get a doctor quick. Stated the girl told him to lie still and they would get a doctor. States approximately five to ten minutes later the police arrived in a vehicle that was not a black and white police car and other policemen arrived, and he was then taken to the hospital.
RO asked Michael if he could give a description of the responsible subject, and he stated as best as he could recall the description is as follows. Subject appeared to be short, possibly 5'8"", was real heavy set, beefy build. States subject was not blubbery fat, but real beefy, possibly 195 to 200, or maybe even larger. Stated he had short curly hair, light brown, almost blond. He was wearing a short-sleeved shirt, blue in color. Cannot remember if it was light or dark blue. States he just saw subject's face from the profile, side view, and does not recall seeing a front view. States there was nothing unusual about his face, other than it appeared to be large. Michael stated the subject did not have a mustache, nor was he wearing glasses or anything. He could not recall anything unusual except that he had a large face. Michael reemphasized that he really did not get a good look at subject other than his profile. Also, it was dark out and it was hard to see the subject.
Michael states that he could possibly recognize responsible if he had a profile view, as this is the best view he had of the subject. Stated subject was a white male, approximately 26-30 years. Was unable to judge real well what his age was. States he feels sure the subject wanted to make sure that they were dead. This due to the fact that he returned and shot each one of them twice again after the first shooting.
When questioned about Dea's vehicle having the headlights on when the police arrived, Michael was unable to explain fully, however states he recalls something about possibly flashing the lights on and off to attract attention of passing vehicles. States he cannot remember if he did this or possibly Dea did it. States while still in the car he called to Dea, does not recall what he said, but recalls the only thing that she was able to do was make a small moaning sound. She was unable to say anything.
RO questioned Michael as to a possible motive, if he had had any argument or trouble, etc. with anyone recently, or if there was any reason at all that anyone would want to harm him. He stated he could not recall anything at all, having any arguments or anything to give anyone reason to do anything like this. Also st1ated that Darlene did not say anything about any trouble that she has had. States they have always been very truthful with each other and confided very closely in each other's problems and he is sure if she had known about someone after her or had a hate for her enough to do something like this, she would have said something about it. States as far as he knows, the only type of trouble that Dea has had was sometimes her friends got mad at her. There were sometimes petty jealousies between her and her friends.

RO advised him to rest at this time and when he woke up if he felt better and if he felt he possibly could give more information to have the nurse call RO at the police department. (Rust)

After this was over, at about 11pm, they decided to look for this girl that Roger knows. They drove around town and did not see her and decided to go to Blue Rock Park to look for her. They went out the freeway to Columbus Parkway and came in to the Park the back way. While they were driving in toward the Park neither boy recalls seeing any vehicle coming out, none parked along the road, nor did they pass any vehicle. When they came to the park area it was dark and they looked for any vehicles. The only one they saw was the victims brown Corvair, same was parked in location as found by the police. They stated that when first observed the Corvair did not have any lites on. Debbie stopped the car in the road and they were trying to decide to go check the vehicle to see if Roger's girl was in it when the lites came on. They thought the occupants were going to leave and then thought they heard someone scream. Debbie backed up her car and turned to shine her high beams onto the car and then they saw a male subject on the ground beside the passenger side of the Corvair, door was open. The male was rolling around on the ground and screaming. Debbie then pulled her car up behind the Corvair and Jerry jumped out and ran up to the male and asked ""are you all right?"" and the male said ""I'm shot and the girl's shot, get a doc."" Jerry said ""All right we'll get one"", and the male said ""hurry"". Roger had jumped out of the car also and heard this talk. Neither of them looked in the Corvair and didn't see the girl. Then Jerry wanted to stay there while Debra and Roger went to get a doctor, but they insisted he come with them. They got back in the car and all three drove toward Springs Rd. in Vallejo and the only vehicle they saw on the drive in was a vehicle's tail lites on the Lake Herman Road turnoff. The vehicle was too far off to tell what kind it was or if it was going fast. All they could tell was that it was headed away from them. They then proceeded into Vallejo and went to 938 Castlewood, Jerry's home and called police to report what they had seen. They all three waited there a short while and then went to Debbie's brother-in-law, Bob [redacted], house, he being a policeman. They were afraid the police would think it was just a hoax.

RO went to location and contacted shooting victim, Michael Mageau. Was advised by Dr. Scott that RO could talk to him for a short time, however he was under medication at this time and would possibly be going to sleep shortly. RO contacted Michael who still was in very bad condition and was very strained to talk as he had had a wound in his mouth. RO asked him if he could as best as possible relate the facts as he knew them as to the occurrences of Friday night when he and D. FERRIN were shot. Michael states that he would do his best to give a statement and gave it as following.
States that at approximately 4:00p.m. Friday afternoon, that D. Ferrin called him up, and in their conversation stated they agreed that they would go to a movie in San Francisco that night and she would be at the house at approximately 7:30 p.m. Michael states he next heard from her at approximately 8:00p.m. when she again called and stated that she had to go with her sister, Christine, to the Miss Firecracker contest, that she would call him as soon as she could, as soon as she was clear from this. Michael states that he stayed home and at approx. 10:30 he received another call from Dea stating she would be over shortly. He stated that Dea came over at approximately 11:30 or shortly thereafter and picked him up in her car. They were both hungry as they had not had supper and were going to go get something to eat. Stated that she was driving her vehicle, the Corvair they were found in. Stated they drove west on Springs Road and as they were driving down Springs Road to go get something to eat, Dea stated to him that she wanted to talk to him about something. Michael stated that approximately at the location of Mr. Ed's on Springs Road they turned around and headed east at his suggestion to go to Blue Rock Springs Park where they could talk. They went directly out to this location, pulled the car in the parking lot where it was found by the police. Dea turned the lights and the motor off and had the radio playing. States they were there just a very short time, a few minutes, and three cars pulled in to the parking lot where they were. They were apparently young kids, and they heard some laughing and carrying on and a few firecrackers were set off, then the three vehicles left within a short time. This was just a very short space of time, a few minutes. Shortly after this and about five minutes before the shooting occurred, Michael states a vehicle pulled into the lot, coming from the direction of Springs Road and Vallejo. The driver turned the lights off on the car and pulled around to the left or east side of their car, approximately six or eight feet away and sat there for a minute. Michael states he asked Ded if she knew who it was and she stated, ""Oh, never mind."" Michael stated at this time he is always kidding Dea about knowing so many people and does not know whether she meant this as she knew the fellow or not. Michael states as best as he can recall, he could not see the car too clearly, however the shape of the car looked similar to the car that Dea owns, a Corvair. He could not see the color or anything as it was very dark out there.

He stated approximately five minutes later, the vehicle pulled up, coming from the direction of Vallejo & Springs Road. This vehicle pulled up approximately ten feet behind and to the right side of Dea's car, which would be the side that Michael was sitting. The vehicle's lights were left on and the subject got out and walked toward the car. He had a large high-powered flashlight, the kind you carry with a handle. This subject walked up to the car and Michael stated that both he and Dea believed that it was a policeman and that he wanted to check their I.D. or something. Stated subject stepped up to Michael's side of the car, which is the right side, shining the flashlight on them. Subject did not say anything to them, nor did they say anything to him. Michael stated he started to reach for his wallet as he felt it was a policeman who wanted to see his I.D. States as he did so, he heard a muffled sound and felt a pain in his back and his neck area. He states he heard some more muffled sounds, sounding like a gun with a silencer on it, and felt pains in his body, his back and around his neck. States he tried to climb over the back seat to get away from the shooting and subject kept shooting him again and again. States finally the subject quit shooting him and apparently turned the gun on Dea and started shooting her again and again. States subject then turned around and started to walk back to his vehicle which still had the headlights on. Michael stated he could not tell if he meant to yell at the subject or if he just yelled from pain, but he let out some type of yell. At this time, the subject apparently hearing him, came back to the car and shot Michael two more times, once in the back and once in the left leg. States the subject then turned the gun on Dea and shot her twice more. Michael states that all the shots that he heard were muffled, sounding similar to a gun with the silencer on. It was not loud. States the subject then turned around and casually walked back to his vehicle and got in. Michael at this time stated that he had to reach outside the car door to open it as the handle inside was broken. Stated he reached outside and opened the car door and fell outside on the ground. As he fell out onto the ground the vehicle the subject was in backed up in a turning movement and then took off toward Springs Road in Vallejo at a very high rate of speed. Michael states as the vehicle drove off he only saw the rear portion of it, this rear part appearing to be a vehicle similar to or the same type as Dea's car, a Corvair. Also a very similar color, possibly a little bit lighter brown. It had a California license, however he could not tell what the numbers were. Stated the subject continued on Blue Rock Springs Road at a very high rate of speed towards Springs Road in Vallejo.

and he asked them to get a doctor quick. Stated the girl told him to lie still and they would get a doctor. States approximately five to ten minutes later the police arrived in a vehicle that was not a black and white police car and other policemen arrived, and he was then taken to the hospital.
RO asked Michael if he could give a description of the responsible subject, and he stated as best as he could recall the description is as follows. Subject appeared to be short, possibly 5'8"", was real heavy set, beefy build. States subject was not blubbery fat, but real beefy, possibly 195 to 200, or maybe even larger. Stated he had short curly hair, light brown, almost blond. He was wearing a short-sleeved shirt, blue in color. Cannot remember if it was light or dark blue. States he just saw subject's face from the profile, side view, and does not recall seeing a front view. States there was nothing unusual about his face, other than it appeared to be large. Michael stated the subject did not have a mustache, nor was he wearing glasses or anything. He could not recall anything unusual except that he had a large face. Michael reemphasized that he really did not get a good look at subject other than his profile. Also, it was dark out and it was hard to see the subject.
Michael states that he could possibly recognize responsible if he had a profile view, as this is the best view he had of the subject. Stated subject was a white male, approximately 26-30 years. Was unable to judge real well what his age was. States he feels sure the subject wanted to make sure that they were dead. This due to the fact that he returned and shot each one of them twice again after the first shooting.
When questioned about Dea's vehicle having the headlights on when the police arrived, Michael was unable to explain fully, however states he recalls something about possibly flashing the lights on and off to attract attention of passing vehicles. States he cannot remember if he did this or possibly Dea did it. States while still in the car he called to Dea, does not recall what he said, but recalls the only thing that she was able to do was make a small moaning sound. She was unable to say anything.
RO questioned Michael as to a possible motive, if he had had any argument or trouble, etc. with anyone recently, or if there was any reason at all that anyone would want to harm him. He stated he could not recall anything at all, having any arguments or anything to give anyone reason to do anything like this. Also st1ated that Darlene did not say anything about any trouble that she has had. States they have always been very truthful with each other and confided very closely in each other's problems and he is sure if she had known about someone after her or had a hate for her enough to do something like this, she would have said something about it. States as far as he knows, the only type of trouble that Dea has had was sometimes her friends got mad at her. There were sometimes petty jealousies between her and her friends.

After this was over, at about 11pm, they decided to look for this girl that Roger knows. They drove around town and did not see her and decided to go to Blue Rock Park to look for her. They went out the freeway to Columbus Parkway and came in to the Park the back way. While they were driving in toward the Park neither boy recalls seeing any vehicle coming out, none parked along the road, nor did they pass any vehicle. When they came to the park area it was dark and they looked for any vehicles. The only one they saw was the victims brown Corvair, same was parked in location as found by the police. They stated that when first observed the Corvair did not have any lites on. Debbie stopped the car in the road and they were trying to decide to go check the vehicle to see if Roger's girl was in it when the lites came on. They thought the occupants were going to leave and then thought they heard someone scream. Debbie backed up her car and turned to shine her high beams onto the car and then they saw a male subject on the ground beside the passenger side of the Corvair, door was open. The male was rolling around on the ground and screaming. Debbie then pulled her car up behind the Corvair and Jerry jumped out and ran up to the male and asked ""are you all right?"" and the male said ""I'm shot and the girl's shot, get a doc."" Jerry said ""All right we'll get one"", and the male said ""hurry"". Roger had jumped out of the car also and heard this talk. Neither of them looked in the Corvair and didn't see the girl. Then Jerry wanted to stay there while Debra and Roger went to get a doctor, but they insisted he come with them. They got back in the car and all three drove toward Springs Rd. in Vallejo and the only vehicle they saw on the drive in was a vehicle's tail lites on the Lake Herman Road turnoff. The vehicle was too far off to tell what kind it was or if it was going fast. All they could tell was that it was headed away from them. They then proceeded into Vallejo and went to 938 Castlewood, Jerry's home and called police to report what they had seen. They all three waited there a short while and then went to Debbie's brother-in-law, Bob [redacted], house, he being a policeman. They were afraid the police would think it was just a hoax.

rec7k41MR4C8XL9dj,Vallejo Times-Herald article on Toschi,1976-09-10,,"recURm55M69p21vYN,recXWIp8s3P3TAYiu","_Here is a Gemini AI transcription of the article about Dave Toschi:_
### Lone SF Detective Is Chasing ‘Zodiac’
**By TIM REITERMAN**
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — For seven years, Police Det. Dave Toschi has been looking for one particular pot-bellied man, about 5-feet-8 tall, 200 pounds, with short reddish brown hair and glasses on his round face. 1
The man appears intelligent and may have learned cryptography in the military. 2 He sometimes wears pleated pants over sine shoes. On weekdays, he may work at a menial job where he is looked upon as little more than a name and number. On weekends, he takes pleasure in killing unarmed strangers. 3
He calls himself Zodiac. 4
In boastful, taunting, sometimes coded communications, Zodiac has claimed a number of murders. 5
Zodiac is a personal nemesis for Toschi, now the only San Francisco Police Department officer assigned to the case. 6 His case files fill seven large drawers, one for each frustrating year on Zodiac’s trail. He carries a copy of Zodiac’s last letter at all times — a reminder that the killer may still be at large. 7
“To be honest, I’m no closer now to solving the case,” the dapper, curly-haired detective says with a tug at his bow tie. 8“It’s been a paper chase for me. My files are getting larger. I doubt I’ll get him unless he makes a mistake or kills again. I don’t know where he is.” 9
### UNSOLVED MURDERS
“He has a personal box score,” the homicide detective says. “We know for sure he killed at least six and wounded two in the late 1960s, but there are many unsolved homicides. He hasn’t taken credit for any specific killings in the last few years, yet whenever we get a new letter postmarked from him, the score goes up.” 10
Zodiac has claimed responsibility for a host of murders, several of which police say he definitely did not commit. 11But they are certain the following attacks belong in his “boxscore”: 12
- On Oct. 30, 1966, a man slashed the throat of a University of California coed, Cheri Jo Bates, in a Riverside parking lot. 13
- On Dec. 20, 1968, a man used a pencil flashlight taped to the barrel of a .22-caliber pistol to find and kill David Faraday and Betty Lou Jensen on a dark lover’s lane near Vallejo. 14
- On July 5, 1969, less than four miles from the double murder, a man repeatedly fired a 9mm pistol into another parked car, killing Mrs. Darlene Ferrin, 22, and wounding Michael Mageau, 19. 15
- A black-hooded man tied up and repeatedly stabbed Bryan Hartnell and Cecelia Ann Shepard at Lake Berryessa Park, about 20 miles north of Napa. The woman died from stab wounds but Hartnell recovered. 16161616
- On Oct. 11, 1969, a man pumped four bullets into the head of taxi driver Paul Stine, 29, in a posh San Francisco neighborhood. 17171717
### STRANGE PATTERN
The first known slaying and the last known slaying are considered particularly strange. Zodiac did not boast of the first, the only slaying outside the San Francisco Bay area. And the last did not fit his pattern. 18
“The other killings were in remote areas and no money was taken,” Toschi observed. “This last one was a sloppy holdup.” 19“He had to have gotten blood on his hands and clothing. Maybe he got a total of $8.” 20
Did Zodiac need money, or did he want to change his techniques, never using the same weapon twice? He concealed his face during a daylight murder, and he used a knife rather than a gun when shots would attract attention. 21212121
### HIS MOTIVATION
What drives Zodiac to kill? 22
In his own decoded words, Zodiac said, “I like killing people because it is so much fun, it is more fun than killing wild game in the forest because man is the most dangerous animal of all, to kill something gives me the most thrilling experie23nce. The best part of it is that when I die I will be reborn in paradice, and all I have killed will become my slaves.” 242424242424242424
Toschi tends to dismiss the witchcraft-Satanic implications. “He was trying to be dramatic. If he had much of an interest in the occult, he never would have misspelled paradise as ‘paradice.’ I think the letters are a screen, not a real clue.” 25
Is Zodiac a perverse sex killer? “There’s no evidence he ever molested any of his victims, nor did he do any fondling or use filthy language,” Toschi says. 26“Some psychiatrists will tell you he’s a latent homosexual or he hates women. I think he gets sexual gratification or pleasure from killing unarmed people. One victim said he was laughing loudly and hideously while stabbing a woman victim.” 2728
### SUSPICIOUS WIVES
Toschi says this after pinning down 2,000 possible suspects whose names were provided by concerned citizens, police officers, prison officials and others. 29
“I’ve even had wives come in and tell me they suspect their husband,” he says. 30“But I never joke about the Zodiac. I’ll talk to anybody about the case on the chance they know something.” 31
Zodiac has not sent a direct statement in months, but that’s not unprecedented. 32In January 1974, after a silence of 34 months, he wrote to update his murder count and to pan the gut-wrenching movie, “The Exorcist,” as “bad comedy.” 33Then in July 1974, he wrote a letter to the San Francisco Chronicle, decrying ads for the movie “Badlands” as “murder glorification.” 34“Why don’t you show some concern for public sensibilities and cut this ad,” printed the man who terrorized the area with grisly murders and occasional threats against busloads of children. 35353535The letter was signed, “A Citizen,” but alert mail room workers recognized his printing, which was then verified by handwriting experts. 36
“When we get intervals of silence, it’s possible he’s in the hospital or in prison where he wouldn’t dare send a letter,” Toschi says. “But this is only supposition.” 37
### FOUR QUESTIONS
A newspaper article will prompt a rash of tips. He has consulted psychics and astrologers for clues. Four men considered likely suspects were placed under surveillance, fingerprinted and questioned extensively. But nothing has panned out. 38
Just what do police know about the mystery killer? 39They have partial fingerprints but not enough to make an identification. 40They have an admittedly weak physical description based on accounts of survivors and witnesses. 41414141They are almost certain he wears glasses since he even wore them during the daytime stabbing at Lake Berryessa. 42They believe he lives in the San Francisco Bay area since most of his communications were mailed from this area. 43434343
Judging from Zodiac’s physical description, his use of dated jargon, Toschi estimates that he may be 35 to 45 years old. “I would speculate he maybe has a menial job, is not well thought of and blends into the crowd,” he said. “He might be a room clerk or work for a big insurance company. A name and a number.” 44444444
“In 1969, I felt we’d solve the case. Zodiac would make a mistake or he’d come in and surrender,” Toschi says. “I never thought then that I’d still be working on the case now. Dammit, I hope I can solve it. I have seven or eight years before I’m eligible for retirement.” 45454545

A short distance away, near the right rear wheel of the station wagon, was a white male subject lying on the ground. A 1961 Rambler station wagon was found parked on the right shoulder of the road, facing west. The male victim (2) was lying beside the left rear wheel of the Rambler with his head to the west. The victim was unconscious but breathing with a large gunshot wound located on the back of the head and blood oozing from his left ear and mouth.

MRS MEDEIROS is the former STELLA BORGES. She lives on Lake Herman Road across from her parents house, two and seven-tenth's miles from the scene of the crime.
MRS MEDEIROS relates that she came in from Oakland at approximately 10:50PM. Her mother called on the telephone and requested that she pick up her son, age 13, at the show. She states that she did not take her coat off, and glanced at the clock in the kitchen and she believes it was 11:10PM. She rode with her mother-in-law and her daughter and drove casually over the 2-7/10th miles, this time the distance being established by the officers, and she arrived at the area four or five minutes later. She estimates between 11:14 and 11:15 PM. Her clock is one minute fast as we had found out during this interview. She states that no cars were going in either direction while she

was on the road. When she arrived at the scene, headlights picked up the car and she observed a boy and he looked like he had fallen out of the open door. The girl was lying on her side facing the road. She had a purple dress on and looked well dressed. She saw only one car at the scene. It looked like a Rambler, grayish in color, it had a chrome rack on the top. This fits the description of the FARADAY Rambler. She states that she drove sixty or seventy miles an hour enroute to Benicia to report the incident. When she saw the police car she honked her horn and blinked her lights to attract the attention of the police officers.

close pattern. FARADAY had one bullet hole thru his left ear and into the back of his head. The ear had a dark area around the hole that appeared to be a powder burn, indicating the shot was fired at close range.

In this interview it was learned that they were hunting in the area from 9:00PM to 11:00PM. 11:00PM was approximate, because [redacted] looked at his watch and he knew it was in the area of 11:00PM. It could have been five minutes to the hour or ten minutes to. It took them three or four minutes, possibly five minutes to get back to their truck, walking up the road on the

They claimed that they left the area several minutes after [redacted], who established the time as 11:20, that they left the scene. They described the light colored 1960 Rambler S/W that was parked at the gate. It was parked Southwest of where we finally found the car. This discrepancy wasn't noted at first.

[redacted] remembers looking at his watch around 11:00 PM or five or ten minutes before and they headed back towards the car. He said it took them about 10 minutes to walk back to the truck. He was at the truck about a total of 5 minutes and a car came in, that has been identified as MRS [redacted]'S, it drove in, turned around and drove back in the opposite direction towards Benicia, again. He states that approximately 5 minutes later they drove in his truck a '59 Chevrolet, red in color, with white wood sideboards, cattle guards, on the sides. They drove this truck back to the Gasser Ranch heading towards Benicia and they passed the car. [redacted] insists that the Rambler was parked on the bank. That would be on the South side. He did not see any person in the car. He estimates he left the area between 11:00 and 11:15PM. He remained at the Gasser's house about an hour and then left out through Highway #21, through the Jamison Canyon and headed home, arriving about 12:30AM.

[redacted] was asked if he had a rifle. He stated that he had a automatic rifle. The RO advised [redacted] of his constitutional rights at this time. Due to the fact that he was in the area and he did have a rifle which he claimed he

had with him that night. He was given a receipt for the rifle. The rifle was tested at the S/O by Rangemaster George Parks. On the basis of the findings of George Parks this rifle has been eliminated as a suspected weapon. [redacted] states that FRANK GASSER does own an automatic rifle but that he doesn't have it at the house. He suggested that we call or see a gentleman by the name of HARLAN [redacted] who lives at 106 Marquis Avenue. It is possible that the gun is there, because GASSER does not leave his guns at the ranch because of recent thefts. [redacted]'s car has California license D-26024.

This gate is located approximately one and a half miles east of the Lake Herman Cottage. Upon alighting from the patrol unit, the reporting officers discovered a white female lying face down in a pool of blood, which was located on the north (left) side of the road shoulder. A short distance away, near the right rear wheel of the station wagon, was a white male subject lying on the ground. A 1961 Rambler station wagon was found parked on the right shoulder of the road, facing west. The male victim (2) was lying beside the left rear wheel of the Rambler with his head to the west. The victim was unconscious but breathing with a large gunshot wound located on the back of the head and blood oozing from his left ear and mouth. The victim was placed in the patrol unit and rushed to Vallejo Community Hospital, arriving at approximately 11:45 P.M., where he was pronounced dead upon arrival by Dr. J. Byron Sandiford and Dr. J.

A check of the area was made in regards to a weapon, which proved negative.
(Cont’d – Page #2)
The interior of the above vehicle was such that the right front door was standing open and the other three doors closed and locked. The front seat back had been let down into a reclining position. The right rear window had a hole which appeared to have been made by a bullet, with the entire glass shattered, and there was found a hole to the rear of the left rear wheel housing, which appeared to have been made by a bullet.
The scene was then photographed, the entire scene and all evidence found by the reporting officers, along with the photos, was turned over to Solano County Coroner Horn and Sergeant Lunblad, Solano County Sheriff’s Office, for proper disposition.

In this interview it was learned that they were hunting in the area from 9:00PM to 11:00PM. 11:00PM was approximate, because [redacted] looked at his watch and he knew it was in the area of 11:00PM. It could have been five minutes to the hour or ten minutes to. It took them three or four minutes, possibly five minutes to get back to their truck, walking up the road on the

sides of the creek. They arrived at the truck and shortly a car pulled into the driveway, which was later identified as belonging to [redacted]. They claimed that they left the area several minutes after [redacted], who established the time as 11:20, that they left the scene. They described the light colored 1960 Rambler S/W that was parked at the gate. It was parked Southwest of where we finally found the car. This discrepancy wasn't noted at first. This was a statement as to their activity during that night. They said that when they arrived there at 9:00PM a white 4-door hardtop, a '59 or '60 Impala, was parked there, and also, a truck coming out of the gate. This coincides with INFORMATION from BINGO WISENER that when he came out of the gate he saw the same Impala and also saw the red pick-up truck go by.

SECOND INTERVIEW: Due to some discrepancies or misunderstandings in the first interview on 12/21/68.
MR [redacted] was asked to pin-point his activies closer on that day. He states that he went to the Gasser Ranch at approximately 6:00PM. They sat around awhile and didn't leave until several hours later. They arrived in the area of the pump station around 9:00PM. They parked the car about 25 feet inside of the Marshall Ranch property off of the road. They walked the creek towards the pump station. They had the dogs loose and they treed either a cat or a racoon in the area of the Dotta Ranch. While they were there they saw some sort of activity up there, all the lights were on, but they were a little distance away and couldn't tell what the activity was.

[redacted] remembers looking at his watch around 11:00 PM or five or ten minutes before and they headed back towards the car. He said it took them about 10 minutes to walk back to the truck. He was at the truck about a total of 5 minutes and a car came in, that has been identified as MRS [redacted]'S, it drove in, turned around and drove back in the opposite direction towards Benicia, again. He states that approximately 5 minutes later they drove in his truck a '59 Chevrolet, red in color, with white wood sideboards, cattle guards, on the sides. They drove this truck back to the Gasser Ranch heading towards Benicia and they passed the car. [redacted] insists that the Rambler was parked on the bank. That would be on the South side. He did not see any person in the car. He estimates he left the area between 11:00 and 11:15PM. He remained at the Gasser's house about an hour and then left out through Highway #21, through the Jamison Canyon and headed home, arriving about 12:30AM.

[redacted] was asked if he had a rifle. He stated that he had a automatic rifle. The RO advised [redacted] of his constitutional rights at this time. Due to the fact that he was in the area and he did have a rifle which he claimed he

had with him that night. He was given a receipt for the rifle. The rifle was tested at the S/O by Rangemaster George Parks. On the basis of the findings of George Parks this rifle has been eliminated as a suspected weapon. [redacted] states that FRANK GASSER does own an automatic rifle but that he doesn't have it at the house. He suggested that we call or see a gentleman by the name of HARLAN [redacted] who lives at 106 Marquis Avenue. It is possible that the gun is there, because GASSER does not leave his guns at the ranch because of recent thefts. [redacted]'s car has California license D-26024.

They had their 1959 pick-up truck, Red in color, with wood side-boards, parked inside the field of the Marshall Ranch.
In this interview it was learned that they were hunting in the area from 9:00PM to 11:00PM. 11:00PM was approximate, because [redacted] looked at his watch and he knew it was in the area of 11:00PM. It could have been five minutes to the hour or ten minutes to. It took them three or four minutes, possibly five minutes to get back to their truck, walking up the road on the

They claimed that they left the area several minutes after [redacted], who established the time as 11:20, that they left the scene. They described the light colored 1960 Rambler S/W that was parked at the gate. It was parked Southwest of where we finally found the car. This discrepancy wasn't noted at first. This was a statement as to their activity during that night. They said that when they arrived there at 9:00PM a white 4-door hardtop, a '59 or '60 Impala, was parked there, and also, a truck coming out of the gate. This coincides with INFORMATION from BINGO WISENER that when he came out of the gate he saw the same Impala and also saw the red pick-up truck go by.

MR [redacted] was asked to pin-point his activies closer on that day. He states that he went to the Gasser Ranch at approximately 6:00PM. They sat around awhile and didn't leave until several hours later. They arrived in the area of the pump station around 9:00PM. They parked the car about 25 feet inside of the Marshall Ranch property off of the road. They walked the creek towards the pump station. They had the dogs loose and they treed either a cat or a racoon in the area of the Dotta Ranch. While they were there they saw some sort of activity up there, all the lights were on, but they were a little distance away and couldn't tell what the activity was. The dogs treed a racoon in an oak tree near the Pump Station. The racoon was shot with

[redacted] remembers looking at his watch around 11:00 PM or five or ten minutes before and they headed back towards the car. He said it took them about 10 minutes to walk back to the truck. He was at the truck about a total of 5 minutes and a car came in, that has been identified as MRS [redacted]'S, it drove in, turned around and drove back in the opposite direction towards Benicia, again. He states that approximately 5 minutes later they drove in his truck a '59 Chevrolet, red in color, with white wood sideboards, cattle guards, on the sides. They drove this truck back to the Gasser Ranch heading towards Benicia and they passed the car. [redacted] insists that the Rambler was parked on the bank. That would be on the South side. He did not see any person in the car. He estimates he left the area between 11:00 and 11:15PM. He remained at the Gasser's house about an hour and then left out through Highway #21, through the Jamison Canyon and headed home, arriving about 12:30AM.

[redacted] was asked if he had a rifle. He stated that he had a automatic rifle. The RO advised [redacted] of his constitutional rights at this time. Due to the fact that he was in the area and he did have a rifle which he claimed he

had with him that night. He was given a receipt for the rifle. The rifle was tested at the S/O by Rangemaster George Parks. On the basis of the findings of George Parks this rifle has been eliminated as a suspected weapon. [redacted] states that FRANK GASSER does own an automatic rifle but that he doesn't have it at the house. He suggested that we call or see a gentleman by the name of HARLAN [redacted] who lives at 106 Marquis Avenue. It is possible that the gun is there, because GASSER does not leave his guns at the ranch because of recent thefts. [redacted]'s car has California license D-26024.

He was at the truck about a total of 5 minutes and a car came in, that has been identified as MRS [redacted]'S, it drove in, turned around and drove back in the opposite direction towards Benicia, again. He states that approximately 5 minutes later they drove in his truck a '59 Chevrolet, red in color, with white wood sideboards, cattle guards, on the sides. They drove this truck back to the Gasser Ranch heading towards Benicia and they passed the car. [redacted] insists that the Rambler was parked on the bank. That would be on the South side. He did not see any person in the car. He estimates he left the area between 11:00 and 11:15PM. He remained at the Gasser's house about an hour and then left out through Highway #21, through the Jamison Canyon and headed home, arriving about 12:30AM.

had with him that night. He was given a receipt for the rifle. The rifle was tested at the S/O by Rangemaster George Parks. On the basis of the findings of George Parks this rifle has been eliminated as a suspected weapon. [redacted] states that FRANK GASSER does own an automatic rifle but that he doesn't have it at the house. He suggested that we call or see a gentleman by the name of HARLAN [redacted] who lives at 106 Marquis Avenue. It is possible that the gun is there, because GASSER does not leave his guns at the ranch because of recent thefts. [redacted]'s car has California license D-26024.

The vehicle's lights were left on and the subject got out and walked toward the car. He had a large high-powered flashlight, the kind you carry with a handle. This subject walked up to the car and Michael stated that both he and Dea believed that it was a policeman and that he wanted to check their I.D. or something. Stated subject stepped up to Michael's side of the car, which is the right side, shining the flashlight on them. Subject did not say anything to them, nor did they say anything to him. Michael stated he started to reach for his wallet as he felt it was a policeman who wanted to see his I.D. States as he did so, he heard a muffled sound and felt a pain in his back and his neck area. He states he heard some more muffled sounds, sounding like a gun with a silencer on it, and felt pains in his body, his back and around his neck. States he tried to climb over the back seat to get away from the shooting and subject kept shooting him again and again. States finally the subject quit shooting him and apparently turned the gun on Dea and started shooting her again and again. States subject then turned around and started to walk back to his vehicle which still had the headlights on. Michael stated he could not tell if he meant to yell at the subject or if he just yelled from pain, but he let out some type of yell. At this time, the subject apparently hearing him, came back to the car and shot Michael two more times, once in the back and once in the left leg. States the subject then turned the gun on Dea and shot her twice more. Michael states that all the shots that he heard were muffled, sounding similar to a gun with the silencer on. It was not loud. States the subject then turned around and casually walked back to his vehicle and got in. Michael at this time stated that he had to reach outside the car door to open it as the handle inside was broken. Stated he reached outside and opened the car door and fell outside on the ground. As he fell out onto the ground the vehicle the subject was in backed up in a turning movement and then took off toward Springs Road in Vallejo at a very high rate of speed.

Also a very similar color, possibly a little bit lighter brown. It had a California license, however he could not tell what the numbers were. Stated the subject continued on Blue Rock Springs Road at a very high rate of speed towards Springs Road in Vallejo.

and he asked them to get a doctor quick. Stated the girl told him to lie still and they would get a doctor. States approximately five to ten minutes later the police arrived in a vehicle that was not a black and white police car and other policemen arrived, and he was then taken to the hospital.
RO asked Michael if he could give a description of the responsible subject, and he stated as best as he could recall the description is as follows. Subject appeared to be short, possibly 5'8"", was real heavy set, beefy build. States subject was not blubbery fat, but real beefy, possibly 195 to 200, or maybe even larger. Stated he had short curly hair, light brown, almost blond. He was wearing a short-sleeved shirt, blue in color. Cannot remember if it was light or dark blue. States he just saw subject's face from the profile, side view, and does not recall seeing a front view. States there was nothing unusual about his face, other than it appeared to be large. Michael stated the subject did not have a mustache, nor was he wearing glasses or anything. He could not recall anything unusual except that he had a large face. Michael reemphasized that he really did not get a good look at subject other than his profile. Also, it was dark out and it was hard to see the subject.
Michael states that he could possibly recognize responsible if he had a profile view, as this is the best view he had of the subject. Stated subject was a white male, approximately 26-30 years. Was unable to judge real well what his age was. States he feels sure the subject wanted to make sure that they were dead. This due to the fact that he returned and shot each one of them twice again after the first shooting.
When questioned about Dea's vehicle having the headlights on when the police arrived, Michael was unable to explain fully, however states he recalls something about possibly flashing the lights on and off to attract attention of passing vehicles. States he cannot remember if he did this or possibly Dea did it. States while still in the car he called to Dea, does not recall what he said, but recalls the only thing that she was able to do was make a small moaning sound. She was unable to say anything.
RO questioned Michael as to a possible motive, if he had had any argument or trouble, etc. with anyone recently, or if there was any reason at all that anyone would want to harm him. He stated he could not recall anything at all, having any arguments or anything to give anyone reason to do anything like this. Also st1ated that Darlene did not say anything about any trouble that she has had. States they have always been very truthful with each other and confided very closely in each other's problems and he is sure if she had known about someone after her or had a hate for her enough to do something like this, she would have said something about it. States as far as he knows, the only type of trouble that Dea has had was sometimes her friends got mad at her. There were sometimes petty jealousies between her and her friends.

Jerry and Roger gave the following statement: They, along with Debbie and in Debbie's vehicle (Rambler brown in color) had been downtown to see the festivities for the 4th of July. After this was over, at about 11pm, they decided to look for this girl that Roger knows. They drove around town and did not see her and decided to go to Blue Rock Park to look for her. They went out the freeway to Columbus Parkway and came in to the Park the back way. While they were driving in toward the Park neither boy recalls seeing any vehicle coming out, none parked along the road, nor did they pass any vehicle. When they came to the park area it was dark and they looked for any vehicles. The only one they saw was the victims brown Corvair, same was parked in location as found by the police. They stated that when first observed the Corvair did not have any lites on. Debbie stopped the car in the road and they were trying to decide to go check the vehicle to see if Roger's girl was in it when the lites came on. They thought the occupants were going to leave and then thought they heard someone scream. Debbie backed up her car and turned to shine her high beams onto the car and then they saw a male subject on the ground beside the passenger side of the Corvair, door was open. The male was rolling around on the ground and screaming. Debbie then pulled her car up behind the Corvair and Jerry jumped out and ran up to the male and asked ""are you all right?"" and the male said ""I'm shot and the girl's shot, get a doc."" Jerry said ""All right we'll get one"", and the male said ""hurry"". Roger had jumped out of the car also and heard this talk. Neither of them looked in the Corvair and didn't see the girl. Then Jerry wanted to stay there while Debra and Roger went to get a doctor, but they insisted he come with them. They got back in the car and all three drove toward Springs Rd. in Vallejo and the only vehicle they saw on the drive in was a vehicle's tail lites on the Lake Herman Road turnoff. The vehicle was too far off to tell what kind it was or if it was going fast. All they could tell was that it was headed away from them. They then proceeded into Vallejo and went to 938 Castlewood, Jerry's home and called police to report what they had seen. They all three waited there a short while and then went to Debbie's brother-in-law, Bob [redacted], house, he being a policeman. They were afraid the police would think it was just a hoax.

Operator gave detail to Off's Meyring & Lindemann in unit 119. RO also responded from the East side of town & upon arriving on Columbus Parkway in vicinity of golf course, observed detailed officers on a car stop. Off.

RO went to location and contacted shooting victim, Michael Mageau. Was advised by Dr. Scott that RO could talk to him for a short time, however he was under medication at this time and would possibly be going to sleep shortly. RO contacted Michael who still was in very bad condition and was very strained to talk as he had had a wound in his mouth. RO asked him if he could as best as possible relate the facts as he knew them as to the occurrences of Friday night when he and D. FERRIN were shot. Michael states that he would do his best to give a statement and gave it as following.
States that at approximately 4:00p.m. Friday afternoon, that D. Ferrin called him up, and in their conversation stated they agreed that they would go to a movie in San Francisco that night and she would be at the house at approximately 7:30 p.m. Michael states he next heard from her at approximately 8:00p.m. when she again called and stated that she had to go with her sister, Christine, to the Miss Firecracker contest, that she would call him as soon as she could, as soon as she was clear from this. Michael states that he stayed home and at approx. 10:30 he received another call from Dea stating she would be over shortly. He stated that Dea came over at approximately 11:30 or shortly thereafter and picked him up in her car. They were both hungry as they had not had supper and were going to go get something to eat. Stated that she was driving her vehicle, the Corvair they were found in. Stated they drove west on Springs Road and as they were driving down Springs Road to go get something to eat, Dea stated to him that she wanted to talk to him about something. Michael stated that approximately at the location of Mr. Ed's on Springs Road they turned around and headed east at his suggestion to go to Blue Rock Springs Park where they could talk. They went directly out to this location, pulled the car in the parking lot where it was found by the police. Dea turned the lights and the motor off and had the radio playing. States they were there just a very short time, a few minutes, and three cars pulled in to the parking lot where they were. They were apparently young kids, and they heard some laughing and carrying on and a few firecrackers were set off, then the three vehicles left within a short time. This was just a very short space of time, a few minutes. Shortly after this and about five minutes before the shooting occurred, Michael states a vehicle pulled into the lot, coming from the direction of Springs Road and Vallejo. The driver turned the lights off on the car and pulled around to the left or east side of their car, approximately six or eight feet away and sat there for a minute. Michael states he asked Ded if she knew who it was and she stated, ""Oh, never mind."" Michael stated at this time he is always kidding Dea about knowing so many people and does not know whether she meant this as she knew the fellow or not. Michael states as best as he can recall, he could not see the car too clearly, however the shape of the car looked similar to the car that Dea owns, a Corvair. He could not see the color or anything as it was very dark out there.

States as far as he could tell this car had one male subject in it. The car then drove off and headed in the direction of Vallejo & Springs Road at a fairly fast rate of speed. He stated approximately five minutes later, the vehicle pulled up, coming from the direction of Vallejo & Springs Road. This vehicle pulled up approximately ten feet behind and to the right side of Dea's car, which would be the side that Michael was sitting. The vehicle's lights were left on and the subject got out and walked toward the car. He had a large high-powered flashlight, the kind you carry with a handle. This subject walked up to the car and Michael stated that both he and Dea believed that it was a policeman and that he wanted to check their I.D. or something. Stated subject stepped up to Michael's side of the car, which is the right side, shining the flashlight on them. Subject did not say anything to them, nor did they say anything to him. Michael stated he started to reach for his wallet as he felt it was a policeman who wanted to see his I.D. States as he did so, he heard a muffled sound and felt a pain in his back and his neck area. He states he heard some more muffled sounds, sounding like a gun with a silencer on it, and felt pains in his body, his back and around his neck. States he tried to climb over the back seat to get away from the shooting and subject kept shooting him again and again. States finally the subject quit shooting him and apparently turned the gun on Dea and started shooting her again and again. States subject then turned around and started to walk back to his vehicle which still had the headlights on. Michael stated he could not tell if he meant to yell at the subject or if he just yelled from pain, but he let out some type of yell. At this time, the subject apparently hearing him, came back to the car and shot Michael two more times, once in the back and once in the left leg. States the subject then turned the gun on Dea and shot her twice more. Michael states that all the shots that he heard were muffled, sounding similar to a gun with the silencer on. It was not loud. States the subject then turned around and casually walked back to his vehicle and got in. Michael at this time stated that he had to reach outside the car door to open it as the handle inside was broken. Stated he reached outside and opened the car door and fell outside on the ground. As he fell out onto the ground the vehicle the subject was in backed up in a turning movement and then took off toward Springs Road in Vallejo at a very high rate of speed. Michael states as the vehicle drove off he only saw the rear portion of it, this rear part appearing to be a vehicle similar to or the same type as Dea's car, a Corvair. Also a very similar color, possibly a little bit lighter brown. It had a California license, however he could not tell what the numbers were. Stated the subject continued on Blue Rock Springs Road at a very high rate of speed towards Springs Road in Vallejo.
Michael states that in what seemed to be eight to ten minutes after this a car came by with three young hippy types in it. He can recall two boys and one girl. States he waved and yelled to the occupants of this vehicle to come over and help him. Stated they came close to him

and he asked them to get a doctor quick. Stated the girl told him to lie still and they would get a doctor. States approximately five to ten minutes later the police arrived in a vehicle that was not a black and white police car and other policemen arrived, and he was then taken to the hospital.
RO asked Michael if he could give a description of the responsible subject, and he stated as best as he could recall the description is as follows. Subject appeared to be short, possibly 5'8"", was real heavy set, beefy build. States subject was not blubbery fat, but real beefy, possibly 195 to 200, or maybe even larger. Stated he had short curly hair, light brown, almost blond. He was wearing a short-sleeved shirt, blue in color. Cannot remember if it was light or dark blue. States he just saw subject's face from the profile, side view, and does not recall seeing a front view. States there was nothing unusual about his face, other than it appeared to be large. Michael stated the subject did not have a mustache, nor was he wearing glasses or anything. He could not recall anything unusual except that he had a large face. Michael reemphasized that he really did not get a good look at subject other than his profile. Also, it was dark out and it was hard to see the subject.
Michael states that he could possibly recognize responsible if he had a profile view, as this is the best view he had of the subject. Stated subject was a white male, approximately 26-30 years. Was unable to judge real well what his age was. States he feels sure the subject wanted to make sure that they were dead. This due to the fact that he returned and shot each one of them twice again after the first shooting.
When questioned about Dea's vehicle having the headlights on when the police arrived, Michael was unable to explain fully, however states he recalls something about possibly flashing the lights on and off to attract attention of passing vehicles. States he cannot remember if he did this or possibly Dea did it. States while still in the car he called to Dea, does not recall what he said, but recalls the only thing that she was able to do was make a small moaning sound. She was unable to say anything.
RO questioned Michael as to a possible motive, if he had had any argument or trouble, etc. with anyone recently, or if there was any reason at all that anyone would want to harm him. He stated he could not recall anything at all, having any arguments or anything to give anyone reason to do anything like this. Also st1ated that Darlene did not say anything about any trouble that she has had. States they have always been very truthful with each other and confided very closely in each other's problems and he is sure if she had known about someone after her or had a hate for her enough to do something like this, she would have said something about it. States as far as he knows, the only type of trouble that Dea has had was sometimes her friends got mad at her. There were sometimes petty jealousies between her and her friends.

Sometimes some possibly boyfriends, not exactly dating type boyfriends, but friends, just acquaintances, would become jealous over just petty incidents.
The interview of Michael MAGEAU was terminated by RO at this time as he was becoming very tired due to the medication and also his condition due to the gunshot wounds. RO wishes to emphasize that throughout the entire interview with Michael it was a very strained situation for him as he had been given a sedative type of medication to relax him and put him to sleep and he was straining to keep himself awake in order to give the information to RO. RO advised him to rest at this time and when he woke up if he felt better and if he felt he possibly could give more information to have the nurse call RO at the police department. (Rust)

After this was over, at about 11pm, they decided to look for this girl that Roger knows. They drove around town and did not see her and decided to go to Blue Rock Park to look for her. They went out the freeway to Columbus Parkway and came in to the Park the back way. While they were driving in toward the Park neither boy recalls seeing any vehicle coming out, none parked along the road, nor did they pass any vehicle. When they came to the park area it was dark and they looked for any vehicles. The only one they saw was the victims brown Corvair, same was parked in location as found by the police. They stated that when first observed the Corvair did not have any lites on. Debbie stopped the car in the road and they were trying to decide to go check the vehicle to see if Roger's girl was in it when the lites came on. They thought the occupants were going to leave and then thought they heard someone scream. Debbie backed up her car and turned to shine her high beams onto the car and then they saw a male subject on the ground beside the passenger side of the Corvair, door was open. The male was rolling around on the ground and screaming. Debbie then pulled her car up behind the Corvair and Jerry jumped out and ran up to the male and asked ""are you all right?"" and the male said ""I'm shot and the girl's shot, get a doc."" Jerry said ""All right we'll get one"", and the male said ""hurry"". Roger had jumped out of the car also and heard this talk. Neither of them looked in the Corvair and didn't see the girl. Then Jerry wanted to stay there while Debra and Roger went to get a doctor, but they insisted he come with them.

hired to assist in writing editorials. Mrs. Suennen stated he worked in this capacity for approximately three weeks. (Phillips in fact worked five days and did not show up for work again.) Shortly after leaving the paper both Darlene and Phillips left Vallejo and went to Pennsylvania. They spent several months in Pennsylvania and returned to Vallejo. Their marriage was going poorly and Darlene decided to go to Reno and get a divorce. James apparently did not want a divorce but did not contest same. Records show final decree obtained in Reno on June 2, 1967. Shortly afterwards Darlene remarried and Phillips moved to San Francisco. As far as family knows no further contact between Darlene and Phillips except she contacted him in San Francisco to have him sign some papers pertaining to their divorce. Family had no further contact with Phillips until he attended the funeral of Darlene and was seen by two members of the family sitting in the back row during funeral services. He was with an unknown WFA who was pregnant at the time. There was no conversation between Phillips and family.
Mr. DeLouise had indicated to RO that Mrs. Suennen had told him that Phillips was at one time committed to a mental hospital. RO asked her if this was a fact and Mrs. Suennen stated she had ""heard"" this but did not know it to be a fact. She was also questioned concerning any particular interest Phillips might have had in astrology or cryptograms. Stated she had on one occasion seen him draw up some type of ""code"".

MRS MEDEIROS relates that she came in from Oakland at approximately 10:50PM. Her mother called on the telephone and requested that she pick up her son, age 13, at the show. She states that she did not take her coat off, and glanced at the clock in the kitchen and she believes it was 11:10PM. She rode with her mother-in-law and her daughter and drove casually over the 2-7/10th miles, this time the distance being established by the officers, and she arrived at the area four or five minutes later. She estimates between 11:14 and 11:15 PM. Her clock is one minute fast as we had found out during this interview. She states that no cars were going in either direction while she

was on the road. When she arrived at the scene, headlights picked up the car and she observed a boy and he looked like he had fallen out of the open door. The girl was lying on her side facing the road. She had a purple dress on and looked well dressed. She saw only one car at the scene. It looked like a Rambler, grayish in color, it had a chrome rack on the top. This fits the description of the FARADAY Rambler. She states that she drove sixty or seventy miles an hour enroute to Benicia to report the incident. When she saw the police car she honked her horn and blinked her lights to attract the attention of the police officers.

Text: The Albany Cipher

The Albany cipher was short—just 50 characters—but presented unfamiliar symbols not seen in earlier Zodiac ciphers, leading some to question its authenticity. When the FBI released the letter and cipher in 2007 through its Vault, they confirmed its postmark and stated that their cryptanalysts had interpreted the decrypted message to include the phrase: “Albany Medical Center. This is only the beginning.”

That phrase has been cited in multiple investigations and forums as evidence that the letter may be genuine, matching the Zodiac’s flair for ominous predictions. Still, handwriting analysis did not conclusively match the confirmed Zodiac letters, and the cipher’s structure diverged from prior patterns. As a result, the Albany letter remains a point of contention: a potential last communication or simply an echo.

The FBI did not officially authenticate the letter as a confirmed Zodiac communication. However, they took it seriously enough to include it in their formal case files. The Bureau’s Cryptanalysis and Racketeering Records Unit decoded the message, and agents investigated the threat in real time. To this day, the Albany letter remains one of the few post-1971 Zodiac-linked correspondences the FBI chose to retain in its files, even as its authorship remains disputed.

recZUA6MMNDn6uOqu,Robertson interviews Bryan Hartnell at hospital,1969-09-28,45000,recGa0aCpwMM0jQkt,"9/28/69 12:30 P.M. Reporting Officer John Robertson, Det/Sgt., interviewed one of two victims who were each stabbed numerous times by an unknown assailant. Victim CECELIA SHEPARD and victim BRYAN HARTNELL both had been placed in the Queen of the Valley Hospital intensive care unit. Victim SHEPARD had surgery performed on her earlier in the morning (9/28/69) and was unable to be questioned by the Reporting Officer, however Dr. Ludwig gave permission for victim HARTNELL to be interviewed.
Although victim HARTNELL was heavily sedated, he was able to give R/O a verbal statement. (Note: R/O taped electrically the interview with victim HARTNELL.) Victim HARTNELL related the following.
He had known CECELIA SHEPARD for some time, they were good friends, and she had come to the Napa County area to spend the weekend. She and a female companion, DALORA LEE, Aspen, Loma Linda, San Bernardino County, Calif. (phone Ext. 2155) had driven from Southern California and were to drive back Sunday, 9/28/69. Victim stated he and MISS SHEPARD drove to Lake Berryessa, picked a large tree near the shore line where they decided to lie down and enjoy the scenery. While lying on the ground, victim HARTNELL stated he heard a noise and asked MISS SHEPARD if she could hear anything or see anything behind a tree not far from where the couple were lying. MISS SHEPARD told victim HARTNELL she could see a man behind the tree. HARTNELL asked her what he was doing. MISS SHEPARD stated she couldn't tell. HARTNELL stated he (suspect) then came from behind the tree. MISS SHEPARD said, ""Oh my God, he has a gun!""
Victim HARTNELL stated the man approached the couple, aiming a black steel automatic pistol. The suspect stated he needed a car and money. Suspect stated his car was ""hot"" and he wanted victim HARTNELL's car keys. Victim HARTNELL stated he began talking with the suspect, telling the suspect he had no money, only a small amount of change, also that if the suspect was really in need of assistance HARTNELL would attempt to help him. The suspect told victim to get on the ground. Suspect then had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him. HARTNELL stated he attempted to keep the suspect engaged in conversation while suspect was tying the victims.
HARTNELL further stated the suspect was described as follows: Wearing a black hooded mask (cloth), covering suspect's entire head and shoulders, coming down almost to suspect's waist. Victim stated on front of the four-cornered type mask (similar to paper bag in style) there was a symbol, the symbol described as white, approximately 3 x 3 inches in diameter, with a symmetrical cross. Also on the eyelets of the mask was a pair of clip-on sunglasses, the glasses clipped to the eyelets. Victim stated he could also see hair through the mask's eyelets and observed the hair to be dark brown.
Victim stated suspect was wearing a light-weight windbreaker, dark blue or black, pleated slacks (old-fashioned type). Victim could not remember what type of shoes or anything about suspect's hands, could not remember if suspect was wearing gloves.
Victim thought suspect was possibly 20 to 30 years of age by voice concept. Victim stated suspect was 5'8"" to 6', 225-250 lbs., dark brown hair, eyes unknown, sloppy dresser, stomach hanging over trousers. Suspect spoke with some
(2)
type of drawl, but victim stated it was not a Southern drawl, did not really know what type of drawl, but thought the man was not well educated, but did not feel he was illiterate either. Victim said suspect's voice was moderate in sound, that is, not high or low pitched.
Suspect told victim he was sent to (?) Lodge State Prison (possibly Deer Lodge State Prison), Montana, for a killing. While there (in prison) he killed a guard while escaping. Suspect also told victims he was heading for Mexico, told victim he was flat broke.
Victim observed cut-up rope in suspect's rear pocket (trouser's), also stated he was wearing a knife in a case (on belt) on his right side, near front of trousers. Knife description: Appeared to be a long bread knife, 12"" long blade, 3/4"" wide, hardwood handle, 2 brass rivets holding handle in place, cotton surgical tape wrapped approximately 1"" around handle of knife. Knife case possibly made of wood.
Victim asked suspect if suspect's gun was loaded. Suspect removed magazine from handle of pistol and showed victim a bullet removed from gun, bullet described as a possible .45 caliber. Victim did not know what caliber the pistol was.
Suspect had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him, suspect then tied victim SHEPARD's hands, then re-tied HARTNELL's hands, then tied both victims' ankles together, had victims lie on their stomachs. HARTNELL stated suspect said, ""I'm getting nervous."" This was when suspect was tying MISS SHEPARD'S hands, in fact HARTNELL stated suspect got real shaky when he was tying MISS SHEPARD's hands.
Victim HARTNELL then stated that without warning the suspect plunged his knife into the back of HARTNELL. Suspect did this repeatedly, HARTNELL stated he thinks six times. HARTNELL stated he pretended to be dead and the suspect went over to MISS SHEPARD and stabbed MISS SHEPARD repeatedly in the back, and when MISS SHEPARD turned her body over (on back), suspect stabbed her in the lower abdomen. Victim stated suspect stabbed MISS SHEPARD much worse than him. Suspect went into some sort of frenzy when stabbing MISS SHEPARD.
Victim HARTNELL stated suspect left the area after the stabbing. Victim HARTNELL hailed a boat (off shore) and told the man in the boat the couple needed help badly. Victim stated the boat left the area and he (victim) attempted to get help by crawling and walking to the road. (Victim believed he had walked to the road, however had not gone too far from his wounded companion.)
Victim stated he thought suspect had been with the couple for approximately fifteen (15) minutes from time of observing suspect until suspect departed. Victim stated suspect did not take his wallet, although when MISS SHEPARD was tying victim HARTNELL's hands, she reached in his pocket and threw his wallet to suspect. Suspect did not take the wallet or victim's car keys.
Victim stated a man in a pickup truck found him on the road and called an ambulance. Victim stated he estimated one hour in time was involved between the time he and MISS SHEPARD were stabbed until help arrived.
MISS SHEPARD is listed in critical condition.

Sgt. ROBERTSON stated that Mr. HARTNELL was heavily sedated but was able to give a verbal statement pertaining to the attack at Lake Berrysessa. The interview was taped and reads as follows:
""INTERVIEW OF JOHN ROBERTSON, DET/SGT., NAPA COUNTY SHERIFF's DEPARTMENT, WITH BRYAN CALVIN HARTNELL (NSO CASE #105907) AT QUEEN OF THE VALLEY HOSPITAL ON SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1969 (TRANSCRIBED FROM TAPE RECORDING BY M. FEURLE):
""J.R. Can you give me this fellow's description and tell me what happened?
""B.H. So many people have been asking me... I hope...
""J.R. Well sometimes when we're repetitious, I know it happens to me, I tell the same thing over and over and over, and sometimes I might vary a little, and if you do...
""B.H. Shall I just start out and tell you what happened?
""J.R. I don't want to tire you out.
""B.H. I just don't want this to happen again to anybody... Of course he might have his reasons, I don't know...
""J.R. Okay. Go right ahead. Start right from the beginning. What happened?
""B.H. Okay. This girl came out from school, I used to go with her two years ago, and she's now going to another school, and she came up to visit some friends and we were having dinner at the school cafeteria, and I said, 'Well, are you doing anything special this afternoon?' and she said, 'Why?', and I said, 'I don't know. We could go out and either go for a walk, go to San Francisco, or, you know, just...', 'cause we used to be good friends. We used to have a good friendship. And so it got too late by the time we got around to what we were going to do. We had to stop in St. Helena for a couple items and then we had to cart a couple kids home and stuff, and by the time we finally got around to it, it was getting late, and I thought going to San Francisco 'd rush you, you know, because by the time we got back for worship... And so we went out to Berryessa, and there was this one place I used to go out... we used to all the time, you know... and I couldn't find it. And so I figured Ah, forget it, and this looks like as good a place as any. So I parked the car, there were no other cars there. I had a Kharman Ghia, '56, white, with a black vinyl top, and it's in pretty

... ""good-looking shape. But we parked there on the road's edge and we talked Oh it must be about a quarter of a mile to down to the place where we went. We had... (unintelligible) peninsula, it's an an island I guess during the wetter season, You can see where it was levee... And so that looked like a lot... there was a big spreading tree up there. There were two of them, really, one was a little bigger than the other. We took the one that was out on the point.
""It was really beautiful out there. We were sitting on top... I lay down on my back and she lay down on her stomach beside me, you know, kind of resting her head on my shoulder, and we were talking, you know, kind of reminiscing about old times, and stuff. And I heard these rustling leaves, and I said, 'You have your specs on. Why don't you see what the deal is over there?' And she says, 'Oh, it's some man.' And I said, 'Is he alone?' and she said, 'Yeah... (unintelligible)...' and she says, 'Well he just stepped behind the tree.' And I said, 'What's the idea of that? To take a leak?' You know, 'cause that's the only thing I could think of, just step behind a tree. And so I says, 'Well, keep looking and tell me what happens,' and she says, 'Oh my God, he's got a gun!' and squeezed my arm and
""And so he came out, and of course still actually I wasn't... There's some things you really wouldn't mind having happen, just for the experience of it. You know I thought, Well I only got fifty cents on me. It's worth all of that having it happen. I didn't think about another angle. So I talked to him, you know. I said, 'Well listen, Mac, (you know I'm in the sociologist field, you know, I'm pre-law, with history and psych.) You know I've read about the criminal mind and everything, you know. I thought well maybe the guy really does need help, you know. I says, 'There's no strings attached.' I says, 'I don't have any money right now but if you need help that badly I can help you out in another way maybe.' And he says, 'Nah.. time's running short,' he says, ''cause I just got out of... some prison in Montana, I don't know what the name of it is. Feathers? Do you know what the name of it is? I'll see if it sounds familiar. Fern or Feathers? It's some double name, like Fern Lock or something...
""J.R. It's Lodge..

""B.H. Oh yeah, yeah, Lodge. At least we know we're together on that.
""J.R. Mountain Lodge Prison, or something of that nature...
""B.H. Yeah. You know he said he broke out and had to kill a guard getting out. And I said, 'Well, man, I mean actually I don't mean to call your bluff or anything, but wouldn't you rather be stuck on a stealing charge than a threat of homicide?' you know? And he says, 'Well just don't start playing hero on me.' You know, 'Don't try to grab the gun,' 'cause I didn't really figure the gun was loaded. I always thought it would be empty. I've heard a lot of times that this is what they do just as a bluff, but I decided not to call his bluff after he really, you know... I told him, 'You know you're really wasting your time with me. I've got a billfold and this much change and that's it.' And he said, he told the girl, 'Go tie him up. I'd feel much better if you were tied up.' And she tied a couple of loose knots on me, so I made it look kind of tight... (unintelligible)... you know, just for a second, and he said 'Go ahead.' And I whispered to her, 'You know I think I can get that gun.' And I said, 'Do you mind?' and she got kind of fearful about it, so I figured since there's two lives involved, not just mine, I won't do it.
""So I let her tie me up on the wrists again, and he tied her up, - terribly tight, you know, real... (unintelligible) ... put his gun away, and we were talking and all, bantering, you know, basically. I was thinking, anything I can do to help, by the way just to keep the conversation going... Suddenly he was taking it all seriously, you know... So I was starting out and finally he said, 'Okay, lay down. I've got her tied up', you know... He strung a rope between our ankles in the rear, so we were like this, you know, on our stomachs, tied...
""J.R. You both facing the ground...
""B.H. Right. And, oh, this was before. I got sort of ahead. So anyway, he said, 'Get down,' and I said, 'Oh come on! We could freeze to death!' I said that a couple, three times, and he said, 'GET DOWN! RIGHT NOW!' He got a little pushed off at me. So I got down and then he finished tying her up and clonked her down, - and then he goes... Sswhooosh (a sound with his mouth)... (unintelligible)

""And so I said, 'Do you have bullets in there?' And so he pulled out the clip and showed me that he did. The bullets were about this long, I can remember, and about this fat, and they had the regular red cap on it, about this long. Maybe that doesn't give you any better description of the gun or not. I don't know. And it came out of the heel, the grip, you know. It slipped out from the bottom.
""And now, to backtrack a bit. I was really trying to see what he looked like, you know. He had on pleated pants, these old type of suit pants, you know, and they were either black or dark blue, I can't remember now. And I can't remember what he was wearing for shoes. But he had on this cotton coat, You've seen the kind, that you just turn the collar up once, there's a zipper down the front, you know. They're real light, super-thin, you know...
""J.R. Kind of a windbreaker...
""B.H. Yeah, like a windbreaker. And it's got this blue, this little collar, sometimes the guys wear them standing up, you know.
""J.R. What color was that?
""B.H. That was dark blue. And I don't know. Maybe he had something in his pouch. I just took it as being a... as being a... you know, he was stout 'cause he looked kind of heavy. I think he was weighing two and a quarter, two fifty, somewhere in there. And I got kind of a look at his hair. His voice... I can remember... almost like I'd heard it before. You know there's some drawls that a lot of people have similar. And... almost as if I'd heard it before... couldn't think where.
""I gave that one up, I just gave it up on that angle. I looked through his hair. I kind of looked like it was combed, you know, like this.. it was a brownish, you know, dark brown hair.
""And this mask he had on. It was ingeniously devised. It was... he had four corners at the top, like the top of a paper sack... black. It came down, came down, with the front panel about to here, and a kind of a thing that came over the shoulders, you know, and then the same thing down the back, straight down. And in the front he had a circle with a symmetrical cross in the middle. You know what I mean by a symmetrical cross?

Case INV 1-15-311-F9-5861
""J.R. Um hum (affirmative).
""B.H. The ends of the cross hung out about this far on each of the... you know, where it came out. The circle was this much... like this... and then it was like this, you see... hung out on the end, over the edge of the circle.
""And he had clip-on sunglasses... it was hard to tell. You know, the sunglasses you clip on when you're wearing glasses, eyeglasses, He had those clipped on. I'm pretty sure... I don't think he had glasses, though. I think he just had these clipped on to his suit... you know, that little mask.
""And I don't know how tall he was. Maybe 5-8 or maybe 5-10, 6 feet, somewhere in there. I'm a very poor judge of height because of my height. I have no meaning, you know. It's always down, you know. It can never be up...
""And so I saw him put away his gun, and I was turning to say something to Celia, and all of a sudden I felt my back... just... no, I think I saw him pull it out.. I don't remember... I think I saw him whip out his knife and just start stabbing me in the back... CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP! I was just (makes a gutteral sound)... you know that kind of a sound... and Celia turned to see why I was (repeats gutteral sound), you know, and she just about fainted. She went hysterical... (unintelligible) ... and when he finally stopped... I mean he went over and... The doctor says there's six in the back, six wounds on my back. You ought to confirm that. One I've got went clear through the lung. I've got it draining. I did drain a couple pints of blood out as soon as I got here. I lost an awful lot of blood, I guess.
""We were down... I mean it was absolutely no question in my mind... when a person gets stabbed as many times as we did... we were going to die. I mean there'd be no reason to question it. But somehow I, you know, started (unintelligible)... I just knew there was too much I had to live for. I mean really it does happen... about getting depressed and everything... when you're young you always think about these things... you know you think about it... and when you've got someone forcing your hand, oh well, there was a lot of things I had to do. And what really kept me going... you know my parents are pretty Christian. I haven't been too much of a Christian myself... but if you believe in the principle you ask God to help you. Another thing, What was my only strength was knowing two things. One, that I did not want to die, and two, that I felt that whatever was

""going to be was going to be, but I was going to try my damnedest to stay alive. And so, like I say, - before I left her I kissed her, and I said, 'Well,' I says, 'I'm gonna try to get help.'
""There was a boat kept circling around out there in the lake and we started yelling at it and finally it came within about 100 yards of the shore and turned off its motor and stayed there watching us for about fifteen minutes, and we were just screaming hysterically, trying to get their attention, you know, to come over here. Oh, I don't know, I guess they were afraid that the guy might be there in the bushes and they were liable to get choked or something. So finally he came up a little closer. I didn't have my glasses on... I was just swaying, you know... and I had gotten one of her hands free before they came, and so I kept trying to get her to untie me, and she couldn't, she was too weak, she said.
""So finally I just kept hollering and hollering, and she said, 'Turn around and let's see if I can do it again.' She finally got it. My hands and my feet were just pure numbness... they're still numb but I'm sure that will go 'way. But I finally got... (unintelligible)... untie her so she could kind of relax out. 'Cause it was a terrible position, you know, upon our stomachs... (unintelligible)...
""And so I started to go for help. I finally got myself fairly reconciled. I wasn't too worried about dying, if that was what was going to happen, but I knew I had to keep pushing on. I had to force myself into staying alive because it was... I could just see myself... you know, all sort of waves would come over... I just (coughing sound)... (unintelligible)... 'Well, you're not gonna give up this easy', you know. And, like I say, I just kept believing that God would do everything the best, if the thing was gonna happen, but I couldn't see any reason why my dying would be the best good. So I just played along with that.
""I just started to walk toward the road... everything blacked out on me... my visual... my mind was never blacked out, but my visual was. So I lay down... My eyes started to come open... I just saw a haze of trees, you know. In a little while I got up and went another twenty feet, and then the same thing happened... (unintelligible)... and sat down. Next thing I went clear... (unintelligible)... the road, and by that time I just fell... I just... I was trying so hard to go far I just went too far. Finally I heard this pickup

""coming... I was just laying alongside the road, and that's where this guy picked me up.
""They weren't in any hurry at all, it didn't seem like, you know, but they finally called an ambulance. About fifteen minutes later it came... (unintelligible)... but I still believe... I've got feeling... starting to get a little pain to come through. But from the minute that knife blade went in, it was nothing but pure shock from there on. I just did not expect it. I didn't expect that he would do that. That was a variable I had completely left out. And I guess he just took off running after we started running. I don't know. I never saw him before and hope not to see him again... at least outside of a courtroom.
""It's hard for me to explain much more. I mean I'm trying to give you a kind of example of his technique. He had some rope cut up in his back pocket. And he had a ... well, I thought it was a police automatic because it was in one of these black leather cases, you know...
""J.R. Was it in a smooth case, or did it have a basket weave like..
""B.H. Can I have my glasses? Oh, they're not here. It was a smooth one, though.
""J.R. Did he have this hood down to about the middle of his chest?
""B.H. No, about like... well, I'll show you... Here... his stomach.. You know I could see his... (voice fades away)
""J.R. Okay. You said his hair looked dark brown. How could you see his hair?
""B.H. 'Cause I saw it from where those goggles fit. I looked so closely to find out. And when he turned you know they kind of flittered... I could see his hair. It looked kind of greasy.
""J.R. Now was he as heavy as I am?
""B.H. Well I can't say 'cause he wasn't wearing those type of clothes. They were sloppy clothes, you know. And he just had on this old pair of pleated pants. I don't know... How tall are you?
""J.R. I'm about five eleven.

""B.H. Well, like I say, he was dressed kind of sloppily, you know. His pants real tight up here and his stomach kind of pouched a bit, you know. I don't know... it's hard to say 'cause I can't judge you with being in a suit and all, you know, and him not being professional-looking at all. He could be about the same. It's hard to say. He was so sloppily dressed.
""J.R. Bryan, you also mentioned a drawl. Well not a drawl, an accent.
""B.H. It was just something... I guess his way of talking. It was something I couldn't repeat. It's like a song. Sometimes you know what you're going to say but you just can't sing the melody worth a darn.
""J.R. Did he have a throaty voice or a high pitched?
""B.H. In between. But it was just a unique way of talking.
""J.R. Did he sound like an educated man?
""B.H. Heck no! I don't think so.
""J.R. Did he sound illiterate?
""B.H. No. He didn't sound that way either. He just impressed me as being rather low class. The reason was because of his clothes, you know.
""J.R. Did you lose consciousness when he stabbed you at any time? Did you observe him stab Cecelia?
""B.H. Yeah...
""J.R. What did he say after...
""B.H. He stabbed her a bunch of times in the back. After she turned around, he got her once in the groin and one in the arm I think. He kind of went a little more hog-wild with her than with me. I faked dead... like that... I didn't want him to come back and give me some more.
""J.R. So you were pretty sure he thought you were dead when he finished working on you?

""B.H. I think he kind of thought that. Of course I don't know because we started talking right after he left. It's hard to say... (unintelligible)... I don't think she fainted either.
""J.R. Was she in a lot of pain, did she tell you?
""B.H. Oh yeah. She was more weak at the time... (unintelligible).. from the religious angle. I told her I sure as heck wasn't going to have any deathbed conversion. 'No,' she says... (unintelligible)... I mean it was just like you were gonna die and had a few things to say. But I felt more and more I wasn't losing strength as much... (unintelligible)... that I thought I could cope with...
""J.R. What you did was a courageous thing. It was a terrible thing to have happen to anyone.
""B.H. Well there was nothing we could do. We were kind of at the mercy of him. I mean I wanted to get that gun... (unintelligible)... There was a time I think I could have gotten it...
""J.R. Did it appear to be a .45 to you? An automatic?
""B.H. It was about this long... along the stock... and had a wood edge on it, you know.. on either side...
""J.R. Handles.
""B.H. Yeah...yeah...
""J.R. Did the bullet look anything like that?
""B.H. No. It was kind of like this, only it was gold, and this part here came out along with this and then round the gold, round the blunt end. Not quite that blunt-ended, though.
""J.R. Was it fat? Fatter than this?
""B.H. Yeah, I think it was a little fatter. But it was gold, you know. And I didn't see any of this here. There was a part where it crimped... Well, almost like that 22, short, only a lot bigger. It was about like this length, maybe more stubby.

""J.R. Did he swear? Did he use any profane language or obscenity?
""B.H. I don't think so. If he did it was no more than I was using at the time. I don't think he used any obscenity. He might have used a swear word or something, you know. That wasn't striking to me...
""J.R. Do you have any idea what his motive might have been? Money?
""B.H. Money. He said he was going to go to Mexico and he was flat broke.
""J.R. Did he search you after he...
""B.H. Heck no! Very unprofessional. He didn't even end up taking that loose change and didn't even take my billfold.
""J.R. Why did he stab you when you weren't fighting him off or anything?
""B.H. I couldn't. Even if I'd have wanted to. I was laying on my stomach...
""J.R. So what would have been the purpose of him to stab you, do you think?
""B.H. Well I (unintelligible)...but I think he got rattled... (unintelligible)... very, very nervous. His hands were shaking... (unintelligible)... Are you nervous?
""J.R. I'm just curious. If you could write me that symbol you were telling me about. Do you think you could draw me a picture of that even without your glasses?

MR. BYRD advised that MISS JUDY was a student at the college and had left the college earlier in the afternoon, driving a yellow Datsun. At 2135 hours Reporting Officers put out an All Points Bulletin around the City and County of Napa for this above described vehicle. At 2137 hours Officers received permission to interview the victim BRYAN HARTNELL who was taken to the X-Ray Room for x-rays. Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Lonergan attempted to interview BRYAN HARTNELL while in the presence of DONALD JUDAH and hospital attendant CLIFFORD MEAGHER. Sgt. Narlow was called away to answer a phone before the interview got under way. HARTNELL appeared to be in extreme pain and also appeared to be in shock. Reporting Officer Lonergan introduced himself to HARTNELL and asked him to give us any information he had on his assailant. HARTNELL stated that the assailant was wearing a black ceremonial type hood, square on top, and appeared to be heavy-set, between 200 and 250 pounds. He also stated his assailant had approached both him and MISS SHEPARD with a gun but had stabbed them with a long knife. HARTNELL further stated the gun was in a black holster and the knife was in a sheath. He stated that the attacker was wearing dark clothing, dark jacket and dark pants. HARTNELL further stated that the gun was an automatic pistol and the knife had a black handle and appeared to be homemade.
It should be noted that HARTNELL was very groggy and he was very difficult to interview at that time. Subject was re-interviewed the next day by Det/Sgt. Robertson and gave more complete details. (The report of Sgt. Robertson's interview is attached.)
At 2215 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan left the Queen of the Valley Hospital after advising Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and William Munk to take charge of the clothing of the victims and any other evidence from the victims when it was released from the hospital. Munk and Brambrink were also advised to stand by at the hospital as a security measure until other arrangements could be made.
As Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan were arriving at the Napa County Sheriff's Office, they were advised by the Napa Police Department that they had located MISS JUDY in the downtown Napa area and were bringing her to the Napa County Sheriff's Office. MISS [JUDY] was interviewed by Lonergan and Narlow at the Napa County Sheriff's Office. She was further identified as MISS JUDITH, a student at Pacific Union College, with a permanent residence address of Sun Valley, California. MISS [JUDITH] advised that she was with BRYAN

HARTNELL and CECELIA SHEPARD earlier in the afternoon. She stated that they all left Pacific Union College together at approximately 1:00 P.M. and went to a rummage sale in the City of St. Helena. She stated that BRYAN had bought a T.V. set at the rummage sale and had to transport it back to his room at Pacific Union College. She stated he left CECELIA at the rummage sale as there was not enough room in his car. MISS [JUDITH] stated BRYAN returned to the St. Helena area and picked up CECELIA at approximately 2:00 P.M. MISS [JUDITH] stated as far as she knew, both BRYAN and CECELIA were planning to go to San Francisco when they left her in St. Helena. MISS [JUDITH] stated she had no knowledge of any plans that BRYAN and CECELIA were making to go to the Lake Berryessa area. MISS [JUDITH] stated the last time she saw BRYAN and CECELIA was approximately 2:00 P.M. in the afternoon.
The interview with MISS [JUDITH] was terminated at that point.
Det/Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow then proceeded to Lake Berryessa and arrived at the scene of the crime, which was approximately a mile and a half north of Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters, at 2354 hours. The scene was being preserved by uniformed officers and under the direct control of Deputy Sheriffs David Collins and Ray Land. The investigating officers were briefed by Officers Collins and Land as to what had taken place prior to our arrival. Officers observed a 1956 white Kharman Ghia with a black vinyl top, Oregon license plate 4 U 2040. Investigating officers were shown footprints in dirt area and tire tracks, both believed to have been left by responsible. Investigating officers awaited the arrival of Sgt. Tom Butler who had been called to take photographs of the crime scene area and Sgt. Hal Snook, criminalist for collection and preservation of physical evidence. R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were advised by Park Ranger Dennis Land who had also arrived at the scene that it was possible to get to the beach area by vehicle from a locked gate approximately one-half mile south of the victim's vehicle. Officers proceeded to the area and arrived at the footpath approximately halfway between the scene of the crime at the beach and the victim's vehicle on the road. At that point, after a brief examination of the footpath area, officers discovered a similar footprint on the footpath to that found at the scene of the victim's vehicle. At that point, due to the lateness and darkness of the hour, Reporting Officers decided to completely secure the area and make a thorough search of the scene at first light. Officers then exited the crime scene area in the same manner and locked the aforementioned gate leading to this vicinity. Investigating officers along with Park Ranger Dennis Land went to the Berryessa Park Headquarters.

took into his possession certain items belonging to the victims that were taken into evidence by Ranger Dennis Land. These items consisted of a blanket, a pair of man's shoes, a wallet belonging to BRYAN HARTNELL, eyeglasses, and playing cards. Among the various aforementioned items believed to belong to the victims, were numerous strands of white plastic line cut into various assorted lengths, some of which had what appeared to be bloodstains. These items were subsequently turned over to Det/Sgt. Hal Snook for preservation.
Assigned investigators then proceeded back to the scene where the victim's car was parked and assisted Sgt. Snook in the making of the plaster casts. At approximately 0245 hours Sgt. Lonergan, having previously obtained the keys to the vehicle from BRYAN HARTNELL's property at Queen of the Valley Hospital, drove the white Kharman Ghia to the maintenance shop at Berryessa Park Headquarters. The vehicle was parked inside of the maintenance shop building and the building was secured for the evening by investigating officers with the assistance of Park Ranger Dennis Land. Assigned Investigators then returned back to the scene where the victim's vehicle had been previously parked and awaited the arrival of Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and Mel Fechter who were assigned to security duty in the crime scene area. At approximately 0300 hours officers assumed their duties at the crime scene area and the security was placed under the direction of Deputy Allen Brambrink. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then returned to their respective residences with plans to continue the investigation at daybreak.
9/28/69 0700 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene at Lake Berryessa area, accompanied by Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Capt. Donald Townsend, and Sgt. James Munk. Officers then assisted Det/Sgt. Snook in tracking the footprints from the vehicle to the scene of the crime by the beach area. (The location and preservation of aforementioned footprints will be detailed in a supplementary evidence report by Sgt. Snook.)
At 0800 hours Reporting Officers Lonergan and Narlow received information via Park Headquarters that a DR. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his son would like to talk to them at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop regarding a possible suspect in this crime. At 0912 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan contacted DR. R. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his 16-yr. old son DAVID LEE RAYFIELD at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop. DR. RAYFIELD gave a home address of Los Gatos, California. DR. RAYFIELD stated that about 6:30 P.M. the previous evening he and his son had parked their car north of Park Headquarters in the general area of the

crime scene. They stated they went down towards the beach area when DAVID RAYFIELD noticed a white male adult subject walking in the area, described as about 5'10"", heavy build, wearing dark trousers, a dark shirt with red in it, long sleeves. He stated this subject was carrying nothing in his hands and was apparently just walking alongside the hill area about halfway between the road and the lake. DAVID further stated that when the subject observed him he turned around and walked up the hill in a southerly direction. DR. RAYFIELD and his son stated that they did not notice a vehicle in the area of their vehicle and only this subject at a distance of about 100 yards. They also advised there was a man with two young boys in the area shooting B-B guns, but they did not know if this man saw the subject or not. This location was approximately 8/10ths of a mile from the scene of the victim's vehicle. In the opinion of R/Os, it is unlikely, unless this male subject had a vehicle in the immediate area, he could have traversed the area to the scene of the crime on foot. There are four coves of water between the scene of the crime and the area where the doctor saw the subject. The interview with DR. RAYFIELD and his son was terminated at that point.
At 1000 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene of the crime and further assisted Sgt. Snook in the collecting and locating of evidence.
At 1320 hours 9/28/69, R/Os interviewed Ranger Sgt. William White at Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters. White was interviewed as to his activities before and during his part in locating the victims the night before. White stated at approximately 1855 hours 9/27/69 he was on routine patrol around the Lake Berryessa area when he received a call from Park Headquarters to proceed to the Rancho Monticello Resort where a person was reporting a possible stabbing. 
White stated he proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort where he was contacted by ARCHIE E. WHITE, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG. RONALD FONG advised him that he had seen a male and a female victim on the beach area south of Rancho Monticello Resort, hollering that they had been stabbed. Ranger Sgt. White, accompanied by ARCHIE WHITE, ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the beach area via speedboat owned by ARCHIE WHITE. When they arrived on the beach they observed a young female lying on the ground with what appeared to be numerous stab wounds. Ranger Sgt. White stated that the female appeared to be in a great deal of pain. White stated as they discovered the female victim, Ranger Dennis Land arrived at the scene in his pickup truck, carrying a male victim who also appeared to have numerous stab wounds. White stated he immediately radioed in and had Park Headquarters call the Sheriff's Office to dispatch an ambulance and a Deputy. White stated he attempted to interview both the boy and girl victims while awaiting

arrival of the ambulance. According to White, the male victim said that a male subject approached them, wearing a hood, dressed in dark clothing. The subject was carrying what appeared to be an automatic pistol and stated that he wanted their money and car keys. According to White, the male victim related to him that the subject advised him he was an ex-con out of Colorado and was en route to Mexico. Suspect stated he had to tie them up, and after they were tied the responsible stated, ""I'm going to have to stab you."" White further related that the male victim advised the responsible, ""Stab me first, I can't stand to see her stabbed first."" The male victim then advised that the responsible stabbed him numerous times in the back and then stabbed the girl.
The female victim advised White that she could not see the responsible's face as a hood was covering all of his head. She also advised White that the suspect had what appeared to be clip-on sunglasses to cover his eyes. Ranger Sgt. White stated that this is the most he could get out of either victim as they were both in great shock and pain. White stated that he noticed a lot of blood near the girl's groin area. The interview with Ranger Sgt. White was terminated at that point.
9/28/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort and interviewed MR. ARCHIE E. WHITE. (It should be noted that ARCHIE E. WHITE and ELIZABETH WHITE are no relation to Ranger Sgt. White.) ARCHIE E. WHITE is the owner of the Boat Repair Shop at Rancho Monticello Resort. He lives at the Resort. Also interviewed were MR. WHITE's wife, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE. MR. and MRS. WHITE advised that they were contacted by RONALD FONG who advised them he had just observed what appeared to be a male and a female subject lying on the beach south of the Rancho Monticello Resort, covered with blood. FONG advised them that the couple had shouted out to him that they had been stabbed and robbed. MRS. WHITE immediately called Park Headquarters and Ranger Sgt. William White arrived at the Resort a short time later. MR. and MRS. WHITE, accompanied by Ranger Sgt. Bill White and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the scene area in one of MR. WHITE's ski boats. When they arrived on the scene, they observed a young female wearing a sweater dress lying on the beach, covered with blood. When they approached the area she was on her elbows and knees, rocking back and forth as if in great pain. MRS. WHITE stated she immediately attempted to make the victim more comfortable and tried to calm her down until the ambulance arrived. MRS.

hurts."" MRS. WHITE then advised after the female had regained her composure, she told her the man had asked for money but didn't take any. She said she hadn't been raped. MRS. WHITE further advised that the female victim told her that the responsible was wearing glasses, with dark clip-on sunglasses over the hood. She told her that the responsible had a black pistol. MR. ARCHIE WHITE stated he overheard the male victim advise someone that the responsible was wearing gloves. MR. and MRS. WHITE further advised that this is the only information either victim gave them on the responsible, and that they spent the balance of the time attempting to make the victim more comfortable until the arrival of the ambulance.
After the interview with MR. and MRS. WHITE, Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan returned to the Napa County Sheriff's Office.
At 1620 hours R/O Det/Sgt. Narlow was contacted by a DEAN of the Pacific Union College in Angwin. DEAN advised that three young ladies, students at the college, might possibly have information as to a suspect in the attack at Lake Berryessa. The young ladies were identified as MISS JOANNE, MISS LINDA, and MISS LINDA. DEAN advised that these girls had been in the Lake Berryessa area from about 3:00 P.M. to 4:30 P.M. the previous Saturday afternoon. They had observed a male subject in a late model, silver blue Chevrolet, two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. DEAN advised that the girls had told him they were observed out of the car by this subject while they were sunbathing on the beach. They described the subject as approximately 40 years old, [blank] feet tall, dressed in dark clothing. Sgt. Narlow dispatched Deputy Sheriff Raymond Land to interview these three girls that evening. (The report of Land's interview is attached.)
Reporting Officers spent the balance of the day and evening going through their investigative notes and issuing a statewide All Points Bulletin.
Monday, 9/29/69 Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan spent the majority of the morning interviewing numerous citizens and officers from other departments regarding this crime and similar crimes. (A general list of possible suspects was begun and they are noted on separate incident reports as to origin of information and description of suspects, attached.)
Reporting Officers were advised by Deputy Sheriff Ray Land who interviewed the three college girls, MISS [JOANNE], MISS [LINDA], and MISS [LINDA] that the information appeared to have some merit and advised that the three young ladies would be in the office in the afternoon for further interview.

9/29/69 1445 hours The three young ladies came into the office and were interviewed by Sgt. Lonergan, Sgt. Snook, and Capt. Donald Townsend.
Lonergan interviewed a MISS JOANNE MARIE, who, [age] years of age, DOB [blank], her address at the college is 114 Dauphine, Pacific Union College, home address South East 12th, College Place, Washington. MISS [JOANNE] advised R/O that on 9/27/69 at approximately 5:30 P.M. she and her two girlfriends parked their vehicle at a location two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. When they left their car they noticed a subject driving a late model silver blue Chevrolet, 2-door sedan, pull up behind them. What appeared to be a white male adult was sitting in the vehicle. They did not observe this subject leave the vehicle. The girls proceeded to the beach area and were sunbathing in their bikinis. After approximately one-half hour had passed, they observed what appeared to be the same subject standing within 40 or 50 feet of them, apparently observing them. This subject was described as 6' tall, weighing 200/210 lbs., muscular build, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing dark pants and a dark pullover shirt. The subject would stare at the three girls but when they looked up at him he would look away. The subject hung around the area for approximately 45 minutes and then the girls observed him walk up the hill. MISS [JOANNE] stated it was very doubtful that from his vantage point in the vehicle the subject could observe the three girls on the beach. She believes he waited in his vehicle and then followed them down after they were on the beach. MISS [JOANNE] further described the car as appearing very conservative. She stated the car did not appear to belong to any young person such as a teenager. She did state the car had California license plates but did not notice the number.
The other two young ladies, MISS [LINDA] and MISS [LINDA] were interviewed by Sgt. Snook and Capt. Donald Townsend.
MISS LINDA who was interviewed by R/O Det/Sgt. Snook, is a WFA, DOB [blank], home address Sunnyside Road, Sanitarium. She stated she left the Angwin area with two other girls, JOANNE and LINDA at approximately 2:45 P.M. 9/27/69. The girls drove through Pope Valley to Lake Berryessa where they parked their vehicle two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand. MISS [LINDA] stated she observed a subject go into the parking lot area to the south. Subject went past their vehicle and backed up so their rear bumpers were nearly touching. Vehicle described as a 1966 or 1967 light blue Chevrolet with California plates. Witness believes the vehicle was a 2-door sedan and described the headlights as being long rather than round. The rear window glass was tinted quite dark. Another vehicle from Angwin with Arizona plates was in the parking area and witness saw the occupants, a MISS DENISE BROWN and a MR. WAYNE HAIGHT.

to the beach and shortly thereafter noticed the male subject watching them from the edge of the trees. After about 30 minutes the subject came down by the beach and passed within 20 feet of witness as he walked from south to north. Subject was described by MISS [LINDA] as approximately 28 years of age, 6' to 6'2"" tall, 200/225 lbs., black hair possibly styled, with a part on left, rounded eyes, thin lips, medium nose, straight eyebrows, small ears, well built, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing a black short-sleeved sweater shirt, bunched up in front, and a white tee shirt hanging out in back, and dark trousers. The three girls left the area about 4:30 P.M. and the subject's vehicle was gone. Witnesses did not observe the subject either leave or get back into his vehicle.
MISS LINDA LEE was interviewed by R/O Capt. Donald Townsend. MISS [LINDA LEE] is a WFA, DOB [blank], address Howell Mountain Road, Angwin. MISS [LINDA LEE] is employed as a secretary of the college press. MISS [LINDA LEE] observed the same vehicle which was described as a late model Chevrolet, sky blue in color. The rear tail lights appeared to be long rather than round. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated they parked their vehicle at approximately 2:55 P.M. and observed the subject in his vehicle at that location. The girls proceeded to the beach and she, MISS [LINDA LEE], again noticed the subject about 30 to 45 minutes after they were at the beach. She noticed him standing on the bank approximately 45 yards from her location. She described the subject as 6 feet tall, stocky build, about 200 lbs., black short-sleeved sweater shirt, dark blue slacks, and straight dark hair neatly combed. She guessed his age at approximately 30 years. Subject had medium color skin and was not wearing glasses. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated she thought she saw a white belt around his back but it possibly was a tee shirt hanging out. She further stated that the man was fairly nice-looking, with a round face. She did not observe the subject leave the area in his vehicle.
9/29/69 - 1600 hours Reporting Officers Sgt. Narlow and Sgt. Lonergan were advised by Capt. Joseph Page that the female victim, MISS CECELIA SHEPARD, had just died at Queen of the Valley Hospital.

Page further advised R/Os that the remains would be removed to Morrison Funeral Home where DR. DE PETRIS would complete the autopsy.
At 1945 hours 9/29/69, R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were contacted by Probation Officer H. B. Schotte. Mr. Schotte had observed the footprint design that R/Os had taken at the scene and stated he had knowledge of a possible similar shoe sole design. Mr. Schotte brought into the office a MR.

Air Force Base and is a Flight Line Mechanic. He is a retired Master Sergeant in the United States Air Force. MR. [BASSEL] showed R/O a pair of Air Force chukker boots that belonged to him. He described these boots as being Government issue, issued to all Air Force personnel at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. They are primarily designed as a wing-walker shoe, however according to MR. [BASSEL] most Air Force personnel and many of the civilian personnel employed at Air Force bases had this type of shoe. The sole design of this shoe exactly matched the plaster cast design that Sgt. Snook had taken at the scene of the crime. It should be noted that Det/Sgt John Robertson had attempted to find a similar shoe design at the local shoe stores in the Napa area with negative results. (Refer Sgt. Robertson's supplementary report.) MR. [BASSEL] was asked if we could keep his shoes for identification purposes and he agreed. R/Os was also advised that this information regarding the type of footprint had not been released to the press or general public. MR. [BASSEL] stated he would cooperate with R/Os and keep this information confidential.
9/30/69, 0810 hours R/O Sgt. Lonergan received a telephone call from MISS MARILYN DENISE, 18 years of age, DOB [blank].

She stated at this time they were parked on the Knoxville Road approximately one mile south of the Lake Berryessa Marina. She stated shortly after they parked the vehicle they observed the victims who were known to them, BRYAN HARTNELL and CECELIA SHEPARD, driving south on Knoxville Road in BRYAN's white Kharman Ghia. She stated as the HARTNELL vehicle drove by, BRYAN waved out the window and said, ""Hi, John!"", referring to MR. [JOHN]. MISS [MARILYN] stated that they did not see the HARTNELL vehicle any other time that day.
9/30/69, 0900 hours R/Os Det/Sgt. Narlow and Det/Sgt. Richard Lonergan, accompanied by Sgt. Thomas Butler, proceeded to the Morrison Funeral Home in St. Helena.

advised that the cause of death was shock and loss of blood brought on by two main stab wounds.
9/30/69, 1430 hours R/O Det/Sgt. Kenneth Narlow contacted CAPT. at Travis Air Force Base and arranged for an interview with COL. and SGT. to take place on Wednesday morning, October 1st, 1969, at 9:00 A.M. R/Os wanted to talk to someone at Travis regarding the shoeprints that were found on the scene. The remainder of the day and evening was spent in answering phone calls from people who had possible knowledge of the crime.
Wednesday, 10/1/69 - 0900 hours Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow went to Travis Air Force Base and were present at an interview in Col. office, who is Commanding Officer in charge of base security. Also present at this meeting besides the aforementioned officers was LT. COL. of the Office of Special Investigation. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan advised the Air Force personnel present of the portion of the evidence we had discovered at the crime scene and asked them for assistance in locating where this type of shoe was sold or issued. LT. COL. advised that his office would assist assigned investigators in attempting to locate the source of the shoe.
Officers were directed to the Base Supply with the assistance of Special Agent DONALD of O.S.I., at which time it was determined through Base Supply that this shoe in question was of Government issue and that it was not kept in stock at Base Supply, however it was believed that the Sales Store had such an item. It was then explained that if a military person or civilian employee was determined to be in need of such an item, he first reported to the Base Supply, at which time he was issued a purchase requisition which he in turn took to the Sales Store and the type of shoe was issued to the individual and they in turn required the individual to sign the purchase requisition showing that he did receive the item. This purchase requisition states the type of shoe that the individual was to receive, however makes no reference as to size.
Assigned investigators, accompanied by Special Agent proceeded to the Sales Store located on Travis Air Force Base. After a short period of time R/Os located in stock a shoe fitting the identical description of the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast which officers had in their possession. The identical shoe with identical tread was found and a shoe bearing the closest measurements in the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast was measured and found to be a size 10 1/2 in military styling or a 10 1/2 D in civilian equivalent. It was determined through Air Force records that they were unable to furnish officers with the

data regarding the sales of this type shoe due to the fact that no recordings were made of the specific sizes, however purchase records indicate over the past 13 months approximately 100 pairs of this size shoe, namely 10 1/2, had been purchased and disposed of through sales. Air Force records indicate this type shoe is manufactured by the International Shoe Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, then shipped to Air Force Depot, Ogden, Utah, and from there shipped to the various military installations upon requisition orders.
10/1/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then proceeded to the Vallejo Police Department and met with Sgt. Jack Mullanax and Sgt. Duane Nilsson. Officers exchanged information regarding Vallejo's crime of 7/4/69 and our particular incident. Suspect information was exchanged and is listed in the separate suspect file.
Investigating Officers checked to determine the validity of the decoded message and as to how far the original cyphers had been decoded. It was then learned that the message had been decoded by at least two different sources, one being by MR. and MRS. HARDIN of Salinas and the other by the FBI in Washington. It was noted that these cyphers were broken independent of one another and the FBI confirmed the validity of the original decoded message. It was also learned that there was a small portion on the very end of the coded message that had not been decoded for reasons unknown.
The balance of the afternoon and evening Reporting Officers and other investigating officers met to exchange information and further discuss the evidence at hand.
Thursday, October 2nd, 1969, 0845 hours Reporting Officer Lonergan received a telephone call from Special Agent, OSI, Travis Air Force Base. Subject called to report that approximately 500 to 1,000 of that type of wing-walker shoe have been sold as surplus on the Base. This would be over and above those sold at the Sales Store. Agent further related he has the names of all the subjects who have purchased this item through surplus and will keep these names available to officers upon request.
The balance of the morning was spent searching fingerprint evidence and answering phone calls from possible witnesses.
Thursday, 10/2/69, 1400 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan attended the funeral services for victim CECELIA SHEPARD. These services were held at the Pacific Union College Church, Angwin, California. Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan positioned themselves

inside the church in order to observe all persons who viewed the services and the remains of victim CECELIA SHEPARD. Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Sgt. Thomas Butler, and Detective Ronald Montgomery of the Napa Police Department positioned themselves outside the church and photographed all persons entering and leaving the services. This included individual photographs and group scenes. Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow also attended the graveside services at the St. Helena Cemetery in St. Helena.
Friday, 10/3/69 - Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Richard Lonergan contacted JAMES, Napa State Hospital, advised him to set up an interview with a patient who is a possible suspect in our case. The patient is identified as GRIFFIN RAYMOND FRANKLIN, WMA, 20 yrs. of age, DOB [blank], 6'2"", 223 lbs. [JAMES] had previously reported that this subject had left the hospital on a pass Friday evening, 9/26/69, and returned to the hospital Monday afternoon, 9/29/69. This subject also had spent time in the Air Force and was discharged from the Air Force in January 1969 for psychiatric problems. According to the doctors at the hospital, this subject was capable of committing this type of a crime. R/O in the presence of JAMES and Security Officer PHIL RYAN interviewed subject FRANKLIN. FRANKLIN was very cooperative and talkative to R/O and went over his activities the prior weekend. Briefly stated, MR. FRANKLIN, whose parents live in Vallejo, never left the Vallejo area that weekend and stayed around home talking with his mother, stepfather, and three brothers. After interviewing subject, it was the opinion of R/O Sgt. Lonergan that this subject was not the responsible. He had a definite very fast manner of speaking which was completely opposed to the victim's statement concerning the suspect's voice. R/O also contacted the mother of the suspect, a MRS. OPAL at Hollywood Avenue, Vallejo. MRS. OPAL stated more or less the exact same thing that her son had stated as to his whereabouts that weekend. It appears that this subject has a reliable alibi as to his activities and had no access to a vehicle that weekend. This subject was cleared as far as this crime is concerned.
The balance of the morning and afternoon was spent by R/Os Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan going over physical evidence and dictating reports.

9/28/69 12:30 P.M. Reporting Officer John Robertson, Det/Sgt., interviewed one of two victims who were each stabbed numerous times by an unknown assailant. Victim CECELIA SHEPARD and victim BRYAN HARTNELL both had been placed in the Queen of the Valley Hospital intensive care unit. Victim SHEPARD had surgery performed on her earlier in the morning (9/28/69) and was unable to be questioned by the Reporting Officer, however Dr. Ludwig gave permission for victim HARTNELL to be interviewed.
Although victim HARTNELL was heavily sedated, he was able to give R/O a verbal statement. (Note: R/O taped electrically the interview with victim HARTNELL.) Victim HARTNELL related the following.
He had known CECELIA SHEPARD for some time, they were good friends, and she had come to the Napa County area to spend the weekend. She and a female companion, DALORA LEE, Aspen, Loma Linda, San Bernardino County, Calif. (phone Ext. 2155) had driven from Southern California and were to drive back Sunday, 9/28/69. Victim stated he and MISS SHEPARD drove to Lake Berryessa, picked a large tree near the shore line where they decided to lie down and enjoy the scenery. While lying on the ground, victim HARTNELL stated he heard a noise and asked MISS SHEPARD if she could hear anything or see anything behind a tree not far from where the couple were lying. MISS SHEPARD told victim HARTNELL she could see a man behind the tree. HARTNELL asked her what he was doing. MISS SHEPARD stated she couldn't tell. HARTNELL stated he (suspect) then came from behind the tree. MISS SHEPARD said, ""Oh my God, he has a gun!""
Victim HARTNELL stated the man approached the couple, aiming a black steel automatic pistol. The suspect stated he needed a car and money. Suspect stated his car was ""hot"" and he wanted victim HARTNELL's car keys. Victim HARTNELL stated he began talking with the suspect, telling the suspect he had no money, only a small amount of change, also that if the suspect was really in need of assistance HARTNELL would attempt to help him. The suspect told victim to get on the ground. Suspect then had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him. HARTNELL stated he attempted to keep the suspect engaged in conversation while suspect was tying the victims.
HARTNELL further stated the suspect was described as follows: Wearing a black hooded mask (cloth), covering suspect's entire head and shoulders, coming down almost to suspect's waist. Victim stated on front of the four-cornered type mask (similar to paper bag in style) there was a symbol, the symbol described as white, approximately 3 x 3 inches in diameter, with a symmetrical cross. Also on the eyelets of the mask was a pair of clip-on sunglasses, the glasses clipped to the eyelets. Victim stated he could also see hair through the mask's eyelets and observed the hair to be dark brown.
Victim stated suspect was wearing a light-weight windbreaker, dark blue or black, pleated slacks (old-fashioned type). Victim could not remember what type of shoes or anything about suspect's hands, could not remember if suspect was wearing gloves.

type of drawl, but victim stated it was not a Southern drawl, did not really know what type of drawl, but thought the man was not well educated, but did not feel he was illiterate either. Victim said suspect's voice was moderate in sound, that is, not high or low pitched.
Suspect told victim he was sent to (?) Lodge State Prison (possibly Deer Lodge State Prison), Montana, for a killing. While there (in prison) he killed a guard while escaping. Suspect also told victims he was heading for Mexico, told victim he was flat broke.
Victim observed cut-up rope in suspect's rear pocket (trouser's), also stated he was wearing a knife in a case (on belt) on his right side, near front of trousers. Knife description: Appeared to be a long bread knife, 12"" long blade, 3/4"" wide, hardwood handle, 2 brass rivets holding handle in place, cotton surgical tape wrapped approximately 1"" around handle of knife. Knife case possibly made of wood.
Victim asked suspect if suspect's gun was loaded. Suspect removed magazine from handle of pistol and showed victim a bullet removed from gun, bullet described as a possible .45 caliber. Victim did not know what caliber the pistol was.
Suspect had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him, suspect then tied victim SHEPARD's hands, then re-tied HARTNELL's hands, then tied both victims' ankles together, had victims lie on their stomachs. HARTNELL stated suspect said, ""I'm getting nervous."" This was when suspect was tying MISS SHEPARD'S hands, in fact HARTNELL stated suspect got real shaky when he was tying MISS SHEPARD's hands.
Victim HARTNELL then stated that without warning the suspect plunged his knife into the back of HARTNELL. Suspect did this repeatedly, HARTNELL stated he thinks six times. HARTNELL stated he pretended to be dead and the suspect went over to MISS SHEPARD and stabbed MISS SHEPARD repeatedly in the back, and when MISS SHEPARD turned her body over (on back), suspect stabbed her in the lower abdomen. Victim stated suspect stabbed MISS SHEPARD much worse than him. Suspect went into some sort of frenzy when stabbing MISS SHEPARD.
Victim HARTNELL stated suspect left the area after the stabbing. Victim HARTNELL hailed a boat (off shore) and told the man in the boat the couple needed help badly. Victim stated the boat left the area and he (victim) attempted to get help by crawling and walking to the road. (Victim believed he had walked to the road, however had not gone too far from his wounded companion.)
Victim stated he thought suspect had been with the couple for approximately fifteen (15) minutes from time of observing suspect until suspect departed. Victim stated suspect did not take his wallet, although when MISS SHEPARD was tying victim HARTNELL's hands, she reached in his pocket and threw his wallet to suspect. Suspect did not take the wallet or victim's car keys.
Victim stated a man in a pickup truck found him on the road and called an ambulance. Victim stated he estimated one hour in time was involved between the time he and MISS SHEPARD were stabbed until help arrived.
MISS SHEPARD is listed in critical condition.

""INTERVIEW OF JOHN ROBERTSON, DET/SGT., NAPA COUNTY SHERIFF's DEPARTMENT, WITH BRYAN CALVIN HARTNELL (NSO CASE #105907) AT QUEEN OF THE VALLEY HOSPITAL ON SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1969 (TRANSCRIBED FROM TAPE RECORDING BY M. FEURLE):
""J.R. Can you give me this fellow's description and tell me what happened?
""B.H. So many people have been asking me... I hope...
""J.R. Well sometimes when we're repetitious, I know it happens to me, I tell the same thing over and over and over, and sometimes I might vary a little, and if you do...
""B.H. Shall I just start out and tell you what happened?
""J.R. I don't want to tire you out.
""B.H. I just don't want this to happen again to anybody... Of course he might have his reasons, I don't know...
""J.R. Okay. Go right ahead. Start right from the beginning. What happened?
""B.H. Okay. This girl came out from school, I used to go with her two years ago, and she's now going to another school, and she came up to visit some friends and we were having dinner at the school cafeteria, and I said, 'Well, are you doing anything special this afternoon?' and she said, 'Why?', and I said, 'I don't know. We could go out and either go for a walk, go to San Francisco, or, you know, just...', 'cause we used to be good friends. We used to have a good friendship. And so it got too late by the time we got around to what we were going to do. We had to stop in St. Helena for a couple items and then we had to cart a couple kids home and stuff, and by the time we finally got around to it, it was getting late, and I thought going to San Francisco 'd rush you, you know, because by the time we got back for worship... And so we went out to Berryessa, and there was this one place I used to go out... we used to all the time, you know... and I couldn't find it. And so I figured Ah, forget it, and this looks like as good a place as any. So I parked the car, there were no other cars there. I had a Kharman Ghia, '56, white, with a black vinyl top, and it's in pretty

... ""good-looking shape. But we parked there on the road's edge and we talked Oh it must be about a quarter of a mile to down to the place where we went. We had... (unintelligible) peninsula, it's an an island I guess during the wetter season, You can see where it was levee... And so that looked like a lot... there was a big spreading tree up there. There were two of them, really, one was a little bigger than the other. We took the one that was out on the point.
""It was really beautiful out there. We were sitting on top... I lay down on my back and she lay down on her stomach beside me, you know, kind of resting her head on my shoulder, and we were talking, you know, kind of reminiscing about old times, and stuff. And I heard these rustling leaves, and I said, 'You have your specs on. Why don't you see what the deal is over there?' And she says, 'Oh, it's some man.' And I said, 'Is he alone?' and she said, 'Yeah... (unintelligible)...' and she says, 'Well he just stepped behind the tree.' And I said, 'What's the idea of that? To take a leak?' You know, 'cause that's the only thing I could think of, just step behind a tree. And so I says, 'Well, keep looking and tell me what happens,' and she says, 'Oh my God, he's got a gun!' and squeezed my arm and
""And so he came out, and of course still actually I wasn't... There's some things you really wouldn't mind having happen, just for the experience of it. You know I thought, Well I only got fifty cents on me. It's worth all of that having it happen. I didn't think about another angle. So I talked to him, you know. I said, 'Well listen, Mac, (you know I'm in the sociologist field, you know, I'm pre-law, with history and psych.) You know I've read about the criminal mind and everything, you know. I thought well maybe the guy really does need help, you know. I says, 'There's no strings attached.' I says, 'I don't have any money right now but if you need help that badly I can help you out in another way maybe.' And he says, 'Nah.. time's running short,' he says, ''cause I just got out of... some prison in Montana, I don't know what the name of it is. Feathers? Do you know what the name of it is? I'll see if it sounds familiar. Fern or Feathers? It's some double name, like Fern Lock or something...
""J.R. It's Lodge..

""B.H. Oh yeah, yeah, Lodge. At least we know we're together on that.
""J.R. Mountain Lodge Prison, or something of that nature...
""B.H. Yeah. You know he said he broke out and had to kill a guard getting out. And I said, 'Well, man, I mean actually I don't mean to call your bluff or anything, but wouldn't you rather be stuck on a stealing charge than a threat of homicide?' you know? And he says, 'Well just don't start playing hero on me.' You know, 'Don't try to grab the gun,' 'cause I didn't really figure the gun was loaded. I always thought it would be empty. I've heard a lot of times that this is what they do just as a bluff, but I decided not to call his bluff after he really, you know... I told him, 'You know you're really wasting your time with me. I've got a billfold and this much change and that's it.' And he said, he told the girl, 'Go tie him up. I'd feel much better if you were tied up.' And she tied a couple of loose knots on me, so I made it look kind of tight... (unintelligible)... you know, just for a second, and he said 'Go ahead.' And I whispered to her, 'You know I think I can get that gun.' And I said, 'Do you mind?' and she got kind of fearful about it, so I figured since there's two lives involved, not just mine, I won't do it.
""So I let her tie me up on the wrists again, and he tied her up, - terribly tight, you know, real... (unintelligible) ... put his gun away, and we were talking and all, bantering, you know, basically. I was thinking, anything I can do to help, by the way just to keep the conversation going... Suddenly he was taking it all seriously, you know... So I was starting out and finally he said, 'Okay, lay down. I've got her tied up', you know... He strung a rope between our ankles in the rear, so we were like this, you know, on our stomachs, tied...
""J.R. You both facing the ground...
""B.H. Right. And, oh, this was before. I got sort of ahead. So anyway, he said, 'Get down,' and I said, 'Oh come on! We could freeze to death!' I said that a couple, three times, and he said, 'GET DOWN! RIGHT NOW!' He got a little pushed off at me. So I got down and then he finished tying her up and clonked her down, - and then he goes... Sswhooosh (a sound with his mouth)... (unintelligible)

""And so I said, 'Do you have bullets in there?' And so he pulled out the clip and showed me that he did. The bullets were about this long, I can remember, and about this fat, and they had the regular red cap on it, about this long. Maybe that doesn't give you any better description of the gun or not. I don't know. And it came out of the heel, the grip, you know. It slipped out from the bottom.
""And now, to backtrack a bit. I was really trying to see what he looked like, you know. He had on pleated pants, these old type of suit pants, you know, and they were either black or dark blue, I can't remember now. And I can't remember what he was wearing for shoes. But he had on this cotton coat, You've seen the kind, that you just turn the collar up once, there's a zipper down the front, you know. They're real light, super-thin, you know...
""J.R. Kind of a windbreaker...
""B.H. Yeah, like a windbreaker. And it's got this blue, this little collar, sometimes the guys wear them standing up, you know.
""J.R. What color was that?
""B.H. That was dark blue. And I don't know. Maybe he had something in his pouch. I just took it as being a... as being a... you know, he was stout 'cause he looked kind of heavy. I think he was weighing two and a quarter, two fifty, somewhere in there. And I got kind of a look at his hair. His voice... I can remember... almost like I'd heard it before. You know there's some drawls that a lot of people have similar. And... almost as if I'd heard it before... couldn't think where.
""I gave that one up, I just gave it up on that angle. I looked through his hair. I kind of looked like it was combed, you know, like this.. it was a brownish, you know, dark brown hair.
""And this mask he had on. It was ingeniously devised. It was... he had four corners at the top, like the top of a paper sack... black. It came down, came down, with the front panel about to here, and a kind of a thing that came over the shoulders, you know, and then the same thing down the back, straight down. And in the front he had a circle with a symmetrical cross in the middle. You know what I mean by a symmetrical cross?

Case INV 1-15-311-F9-5861
""J.R. Um hum (affirmative).
""B.H. The ends of the cross hung out about this far on each of the... you know, where it came out. The circle was this much... like this... and then it was like this, you see... hung out on the end, over the edge of the circle.
""And he had clip-on sunglasses... it was hard to tell. You know, the sunglasses you clip on when you're wearing glasses, eyeglasses, He had those clipped on. I'm pretty sure... I don't think he had glasses, though. I think he just had these clipped on to his suit... you know, that little mask.
""And I don't know how tall he was. Maybe 5-8 or maybe 5-10, 6 feet, somewhere in there. I'm a very poor judge of height because of my height. I have no meaning, you know. It's always down, you know. It can never be up...
""And so I saw him put away his gun, and I was turning to say something to Celia, and all of a sudden I felt my back... just... no, I think I saw him pull it out.. I don't remember... I think I saw him whip out his knife and just start stabbing me in the back... CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP! I was just (makes a gutteral sound)... you know that kind of a sound... and Celia turned to see why I was (repeats gutteral sound), you know, and she just about fainted. She went hysterical... (unintelligible) ... and when he finally stopped... I mean he went over and... The doctor says there's six in the back, six wounds on my back. You ought to confirm that. One I've got went clear through the lung. I've got it draining. I did drain a couple pints of blood out as soon as I got here. I lost an awful lot of blood, I guess.
""We were down... I mean it was absolutely no question in my mind... when a person gets stabbed as many times as we did... we were going to die. I mean there'd be no reason to question it. But somehow I, you know, started (unintelligible)... I just knew there was too much I had to live for. I mean really it does happen... about getting depressed and everything... when you're young you always think about these things... you know you think about it... and when you've got someone forcing your hand, oh well, there was a lot of things I had to do. And what really kept me going... you know my parents are pretty Christian. I haven't been too much of a Christian myself... but if you believe in the principle you ask God to help you. Another thing, What was my only strength was knowing two things. One, that I did not want to die, and two, that I felt that whatever was

""going to be was going to be, but I was going to try my damnedest to stay alive. And so, like I say, - before I left her I kissed her, and I said, 'Well,' I says, 'I'm gonna try to get help.'
""There was a boat kept circling around out there in the lake and we started yelling at it and finally it came within about 100 yards of the shore and turned off its motor and stayed there watching us for about fifteen minutes, and we were just screaming hysterically, trying to get their attention, you know, to come over here. Oh, I don't know, I guess they were afraid that the guy might be there in the bushes and they were liable to get choked or something. So finally he came up a little closer. I didn't have my glasses on... I was just swaying, you know... and I had gotten one of her hands free before they came, and so I kept trying to get her to untie me, and she couldn't, she was too weak, she said.
""So finally I just kept hollering and hollering, and she said, 'Turn around and let's see if I can do it again.' She finally got it. My hands and my feet were just pure numbness... they're still numb but I'm sure that will go 'way. But I finally got... (unintelligible)... untie her so she could kind of relax out. 'Cause it was a terrible position, you know, upon our stomachs... (unintelligible)...
""And so I started to go for help. I finally got myself fairly reconciled. I wasn't too worried about dying, if that was what was going to happen, but I knew I had to keep pushing on. I had to force myself into staying alive because it was... I could just see myself... you know, all sort of waves would come over... I just (coughing sound)... (unintelligible)... 'Well, you're not gonna give up this easy', you know. And, like I say, I just kept believing that God would do everything the best, if the thing was gonna happen, but I couldn't see any reason why my dying would be the best good. So I just played along with that.
""I just started to walk toward the road... everything blacked out on me... my visual... my mind was never blacked out, but my visual was. So I lay down... My eyes started to come open... I just saw a haze of trees, you know. In a little while I got up and went another twenty feet, and then the same thing happened... (unintelligible)... and sat down. Next thing I went clear... (unintelligible)... the road, and by that time I just fell... I just... I was trying so hard to go far I just went too far. Finally I heard this pickup

""coming... I was just laying alongside the road, and that's where this guy picked me up.
""They weren't in any hurry at all, it didn't seem like, you know, but they finally called an ambulance. About fifteen minutes later it came... (unintelligible)... but I still believe... I've got feeling... starting to get a little pain to come through. But from the minute that knife blade went in, it was nothing but pure shock from there on. I just did not expect it. I didn't expect that he would do that. That was a variable I had completely left out. And I guess he just took off running after we started running. I don't know. I never saw him before and hope not to see him again... at least outside of a courtroom.
""It's hard for me to explain much more. I mean I'm trying to give you a kind of example of his technique. He had some rope cut up in his back pocket. And he had a ... well, I thought it was a police automatic because it was in one of these black leather cases, you know...
""J.R. Was it in a smooth case, or did it have a basket weave like..
""B.H. Can I have my glasses? Oh, they're not here. It was a smooth one, though.
""J.R. Did he have this hood down to about the middle of his chest?
""B.H. No, about like... well, I'll show you... Here... his stomach.. You know I could see his... (voice fades away)
""J.R. Okay. You said his hair looked dark brown. How could you see his hair?
""B.H. 'Cause I saw it from where those goggles fit. I looked so closely to find out. And when he turned you know they kind of flittered... I could see his hair. It looked kind of greasy.
""J.R. Now was he as heavy as I am?
""B.H. Well I can't say 'cause he wasn't wearing those type of clothes. They were sloppy clothes, you know. And he just had on this old pair of pleated pants. I don't know... How tall are you?
""J.R. I'm about five eleven.

(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)
Case INV 1-15-311-F9-5861
""B.H. Well, like I say, he was dressed kind of sloppily, you know. His pants real tight up here and his stomach kind of pouched a bit, you know. I don't know... it's hard to say 'cause I can't judge you with being in a suit and all, you know, and him not being professional-looking at all. He could be about the same. It's hard to say. He was so sloppily dressed.
""J.R. Bryan, you also mentioned a drawl. Well not a drawl, an accent.
""B.H. It was just something... I guess his way of talking. It was something I couldn't repeat. It's like a song. Sometimes you know what you're going to say but you just can't sing the melody worth a darn.
""J.R. Did he have a throaty voice or a high pitched?
""B.H. In between. But it was just a unique way of talking.
""J.R. Did he sound like an educated man?
""B.H. Heck no! I don't think so.
""J.R. Did he sound illiterate?
""B.H. No. He didn't sound that way either. He just impressed me as being rather low class. The reason was because of his clothes, you know.
""J.R. Did you lose consciousness when he stabbed you at any time? Did you observe him stab Cecelia?
""B.H. Yeah...
""J.R. What did he say after...
""B.H. He stabbed her a bunch of times in the back. After she turned around, he got her once in the groin and one in the arm I think. He kind of went a little more hog-wild with her than with me. I faked dead... like that... I didn't want him to come back and give me some more.
""J.R. So you were pretty sure he thought you were dead when he finished working on you?

""B.H. I think he kind of thought that. Of course I don't know because we started talking right after he left. It's hard to say... (unintelligible)... I don't think she fainted either.
""J.R. Was she in a lot of pain, did she tell you?
""B.H. Oh yeah. She was more weak at the time... (unintelligible).. from the religious angle. I told her I sure as heck wasn't going to have any deathbed conversion. 'No,' she says... (unintelligible)... I mean it was just like you were gonna die and had a few things to say. But I felt more and more I wasn't losing strength as much... (unintelligible)... that I thought I could cope with...
""J.R. What you did was a courageous thing. It was a terrible thing to have happen to anyone.
""B.H. Well there was nothing we could do. We were kind of at the mercy of him. I mean I wanted to get that gun... (unintelligible)... There was a time I think I could have gotten it...
""J.R. Did it appear to be a .45 to you? An automatic?
""B.H. It was about this long... along the stock... and had a wood edge on it, you know.. on either side...
""J.R. Handles.
""B.H. Yeah...yeah...
""J.R. Did the bullet look anything like that?
""B.H. No. It was kind of like this, only it was gold, and this part here came out along with this and then round the gold, round the blunt end. Not quite that blunt-ended, though.
""J.R. Was it fat? Fatter than this?
""B.H. Yeah, I think it was a little fatter. But it was gold, you know. And I didn't see any of this here. There was a part where it crimped... Well, almost like that 22, short, only a lot bigger. It was about like this length, maybe more stubby.

""J.R. Well I'll get a .45 a little later and we can bring it up and let you observe it.
""B.H. ""Let's take the suspect. His hands... I don't remember if they had gloves on or not. I can't remember now. I keep thinking that he had gloves on. I can't figure how he tied us... Let's ask Celia, she probably knows about that.
""J.R. Did he swear? Did he use any profane language or obscenity?
""B.H. I don't think so. If he did it was no more than I was using at the time. I don't think he used any obscenity. He might have used a swear word or something, you know. That wasn't striking to me...
""J.R. Do you have any idea what his motive might have been? Money?
""B.H. Money. He said he was going to go to Mexico and he was flat broke.
""J.R. Did he search you after he...
""B.H. Heck no! Very unprofessional. He didn't even end up taking that loose change and didn't even take my billfold.
""J.R. Why did he stab you when you weren't fighting him off or anything?
""B.H. I couldn't. Even if I'd have wanted to. I was laying on my stomach...
""J.R. So what would have been the purpose of him to stab you, do you think?
""B.H. Well I (unintelligible)...but I think he got rattled... (unintelligible)... very, very nervous. His hands were shaking... (unintelligible)... Are you nervous?
""J.R. I'm just curious. If you could write me that symbol you were telling me about. Do you think you could draw me a picture of that even without your glasses?

MR. BYRD advised that MISS JUDY was a student at the college and had left the college earlier in the afternoon, driving a yellow Datsun. At 2135 hours Reporting Officers put out an All Points Bulletin around the City and County of Napa for this above described vehicle. At 2137 hours Officers received permission to interview the victim BRYAN HARTNELL who was taken to the X-Ray Room for x-rays. Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Lonergan attempted to interview BRYAN HARTNELL while in the presence of DONALD JUDAH and hospital attendant CLIFFORD MEAGHER. Sgt. Narlow was called away to answer a phone before the interview got under way. HARTNELL appeared to be in extreme pain and also appeared to be in shock. Reporting Officer Lonergan introduced himself to HARTNELL and asked him to give us any information he had on his assailant. HARTNELL stated that the assailant was wearing a black ceremonial type hood, square on top, and appeared to be heavy-set, between 200 and 250 pounds. He also stated his assailant had approached both him and MISS SHEPARD with a gun but had stabbed them with a long knife. HARTNELL further stated the gun was in a black holster and the knife was in a sheath. He stated that the attacker was wearing dark clothing, dark jacket and dark pants. HARTNELL further stated that the gun was an automatic pistol and the knife had a black handle and appeared to be homemade.
It should be noted that HARTNELL was very groggy and he was very difficult to interview at that time. Subject was re-interviewed the next day by Det/Sgt. Robertson and gave more complete details. (The report of Sgt. Robertson's interview is attached.)
At 2215 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan left the Queen of the Valley Hospital after advising Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and William Munk to take charge of the clothing of the victims and any other evidence from the victims when it was released from the hospital. Munk and Brambrink were also advised to stand by at the hospital as a security measure until other arrangements could be made.
As Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan were arriving at the Napa County Sheriff's Office, they were advised by the Napa Police Department that they had located MISS JUDY in the downtown Napa area and were bringing her to the Napa County Sheriff's Office. MISS [JUDY] was interviewed by Lonergan and Narlow at the Napa County Sheriff's Office. She was further identified as MISS JUDITH, a student at Pacific Union College, with a permanent residence address of Sun Valley, California. MISS [JUDITH] advised that she was with BRYAN

HARTNELL and CECELIA SHEPARD earlier in the afternoon. She stated that they all left Pacific Union College together at approximately 1:00 P.M. and went to a rummage sale in the City of St. Helena. She stated that BRYAN had bought a T.V. set at the rummage sale and had to transport it back to his room at Pacific Union College. She stated he left CECELIA at the rummage sale as there was not enough room in his car. MISS [JUDITH] stated BRYAN returned to the St. Helena area and picked up CECELIA at approximately 2:00 P.M. MISS [JUDITH] stated as far as she knew, both BRYAN and CECELIA were planning to go to San Francisco when they left her in St. Helena. MISS [JUDITH] stated she had no knowledge of any plans that BRYAN and CECELIA were making to go to the Lake Berryessa area. MISS [JUDITH] stated the last time she saw BRYAN and CECELIA was approximately 2:00 P.M. in the afternoon.
The interview with MISS [JUDITH] was terminated at that point.
Det/Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow then proceeded to Lake Berryessa and arrived at the scene of the crime, which was approximately a mile and a half north of Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters, at 2354 hours. The scene was being preserved by uniformed officers and under the direct control of Deputy Sheriffs David Collins and Ray Land. The investigating officers were briefed by Officers Collins and Land as to what had taken place prior to our arrival. Officers observed a 1956 white Kharman Ghia with a black vinyl top, Oregon license plate 4 U 2040. Investigating officers were shown footprints in dirt area and tire tracks, both believed to have been left by responsible. Investigating officers awaited the arrival of Sgt. Tom Butler who had been called to take photographs of the crime scene area and Sgt. Hal Snook, criminalist for collection and preservation of physical evidence. R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were advised by Park Ranger Dennis Land who had also arrived at the scene that it was possible to get to the beach area by vehicle from a locked gate approximately one-half mile south of the victim's vehicle. Officers proceeded to the area and arrived at the footpath approximately halfway between the scene of the crime at the beach and the victim's vehicle on the road. At that point, after a brief examination of the footpath area, officers discovered a similar footprint on the footpath to that found at the scene of the victim's vehicle. At that point, due to the lateness and darkness of the hour, Reporting Officers decided to completely secure the area and make a thorough search of the scene at first light. Officers then exited the crime scene area in the same manner and locked the aforementioned gate leading to this vicinity. Investigating officers along with Park Ranger Dennis Land went to the Berryessa Park Headquarters.

took into his possession certain items belonging to the victims that were taken into evidence by Ranger Dennis Land. These items consisted of a blanket, a pair of man's shoes, a wallet belonging to BRYAN HARTNELL, eyeglasses, and playing cards. Among the various aforementioned items believed to belong to the victims, were numerous strands of white plastic line cut into various assorted lengths, some of which had what appeared to be bloodstains. These items were subsequently turned over to Det/Sgt. Hal Snook for preservation.
Assigned investigators then proceeded back to the scene where the victim's car was parked and assisted Sgt. Snook in the making of the plaster casts. At approximately 0245 hours Sgt. Lonergan, having previously obtained the keys to the vehicle from BRYAN HARTNELL's property at Queen of the Valley Hospital, drove the white Kharman Ghia to the maintenance shop at Berryessa Park Headquarters. The vehicle was parked inside of the maintenance shop building and the building was secured for the evening by investigating officers with the assistance of Park Ranger Dennis Land. Assigned Investigators then returned back to the scene where the victim's vehicle had been previously parked and awaited the arrival of Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and Mel Fechter who were assigned to security duty in the crime scene area. At approximately 0300 hours officers assumed their duties at the crime scene area and the security was placed under the direction of Deputy Allen Brambrink. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then returned to their respective residences with plans to continue the investigation at daybreak.
9/28/69 0700 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene at Lake Berryessa area, accompanied by Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Capt. Donald Townsend, and Sgt. James Munk. Officers then assisted Det/Sgt. Snook in tracking the footprints from the vehicle to the scene of the crime by the beach area. (The location and preservation of aforementioned footprints will be detailed in a supplementary evidence report by Sgt. Snook.)
At 0800 hours Reporting Officers Lonergan and Narlow received information via Park Headquarters that a DR. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his son would like to talk to them at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop regarding a possible suspect in this crime. At 0912 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan contacted DR. R. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his 16-yr. old son DAVID LEE RAYFIELD at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop. DR. RAYFIELD gave a home address of Los Gatos, California. DR. RAYFIELD stated that about 6:30 P.M. the previous evening he and his son had parked their car north of Park Headquarters in the general area of the

crime scene. They stated they went down towards the beach area when DAVID RAYFIELD noticed a white male adult subject walking in the area, described as about 5'10"", heavy build, wearing dark trousers, a dark shirt with red in it, long sleeves. He stated this subject was carrying nothing in his hands and was apparently just walking alongside the hill area about halfway between the road and the lake. DAVID further stated that when the subject observed him he turned around and walked up the hill in a southerly direction. DR. RAYFIELD and his son stated that they did not notice a vehicle in the area of their vehicle and only this subject at a distance of about 100 yards. They also advised there was a man with two young boys in the area shooting B-B guns, but they did not know if this man saw the subject or not. This location was approximately 8/10ths of a mile from the scene of the victim's vehicle. In the opinion of R/Os, it is unlikely, unless this male subject had a vehicle in the immediate area, he could have traversed the area to the scene of the crime on foot. There are four coves of water between the scene of the crime and the area where the doctor saw the subject. The interview with DR. RAYFIELD and his son was terminated at that point.
At 1000 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene of the crime and further assisted Sgt. Snook in the collecting and locating of evidence.
At 1320 hours 9/28/69, R/Os interviewed Ranger Sgt. William White at Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters. White was interviewed as to his activities before and during his part in locating the victims the night before. White stated at approximately 1855 hours 9/27/69 he was on routine patrol around the Lake Berryessa area when he received a call from Park Headquarters to proceed to the Rancho Monticello Resort where a person was reporting a possible stabbing. 
White stated he proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort where he was contacted by ARCHIE E. WHITE, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG. RONALD FONG advised him that he had seen a male and a female victim on the beach area south of Rancho Monticello Resort, hollering that they had been stabbed. Ranger Sgt. White, accompanied by ARCHIE WHITE, ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the beach area via speedboat owned by ARCHIE WHITE. When they arrived on the beach they observed a young female lying on the ground with what appeared to be numerous stab wounds. Ranger Sgt. White stated that the female appeared to be in a great deal of pain. White stated as they discovered the female victim, Ranger Dennis Land arrived at the scene in his pickup truck, carrying a male victim who also appeared to have numerous stab wounds. White stated he immediately radioed in and had Park Headquarters call the Sheriff's Office to dispatch an ambulance and a Deputy. White stated he attempted to interview both the boy and girl victims while awaiting

arrival of the ambulance. According to White, the male victim said that a male subject approached them, wearing a hood, dressed in dark clothing. The subject was carrying what appeared to be an automatic pistol and stated that he wanted their money and car keys. According to White, the male victim related to him that the subject advised him he was an ex-con out of Colorado and was en route to Mexico. Suspect stated he had to tie them up, and after they were tied the responsible stated, ""I'm going to have to stab you."" White further related that the male victim advised the responsible, ""Stab me first, I can't stand to see her stabbed first."" The male victim then advised that the responsible stabbed him numerous times in the back and then stabbed the girl.
The female victim advised White that she could not see the responsible's face as a hood was covering all of his head. She also advised White that the suspect had what appeared to be clip-on sunglasses to cover his eyes. Ranger Sgt. White stated that this is the most he could get out of either victim as they were both in great shock and pain. White stated that he noticed a lot of blood near the girl's groin area. The interview with Ranger Sgt. White was terminated at that point.
9/28/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort and interviewed MR. ARCHIE E. WHITE. (It should be noted that ARCHIE E. WHITE and ELIZABETH WHITE are no relation to Ranger Sgt. White.) ARCHIE E. WHITE is the owner of the Boat Repair Shop at Rancho Monticello Resort. He lives at the Resort. Also interviewed were MR. WHITE's wife, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE. MR. and MRS. WHITE advised that they were contacted by RONALD FONG who advised them he had just observed what appeared to be a male and a female subject lying on the beach south of the Rancho Monticello Resort, covered with blood. FONG advised them that the couple had shouted out to him that they had been stabbed and robbed. MRS. WHITE immediately called Park Headquarters and Ranger Sgt. William White arrived at the Resort a short time later. MR. and MRS. WHITE, accompanied by Ranger Sgt. Bill White and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the scene area in one of MR. WHITE's ski boats. When they arrived on the scene, they observed a young female wearing a sweater dress lying on the beach, covered with blood. When they approached the area she was on her elbows and knees, rocking back and forth as if in great pain. MRS. WHITE stated she immediately attempted to make the victim more comfortable and tried to calm her down until the ambulance arrived. MRS. WHITE stated the girl advised him, ""He was a man with a hood... His face was covered... He was wearing black pants... It hurts, it

hurts."" MRS. WHITE then advised after the female had regained her composure, she told her the man had asked for money but didn't take any. She said she hadn't been raped. MRS. WHITE further advised that the female victim told her that the responsible was wearing glasses, with dark clip-on sunglasses over the hood. She told her that the responsible had a black pistol. MR. ARCHIE WHITE stated he overheard the male victim advise someone that the responsible was wearing gloves. MR. and MRS. WHITE further advised that this is the only information either victim gave them on the responsible, and that they spent the balance of the time attempting to make the victim more comfortable until the arrival of the ambulance.
After the interview with MR. and MRS. WHITE, Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan returned to the Napa County Sheriff's Office.
At 1620 hours R/O Det/Sgt. Narlow was contacted by a DEAN of the Pacific Union College in Angwin. DEAN advised that three young ladies, students at the college, might possibly have information as to a suspect in the attack at Lake Berryessa. The young ladies were identified as MISS JOANNE, MISS LINDA, and MISS LINDA. DEAN advised that these girls had been in the Lake Berryessa area from about 3:00 P.M. to 4:30 P.M. the previous Saturday afternoon. They had observed a male subject in a late model, silver blue Chevrolet, two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. DEAN advised that the girls had told him they were observed out of the car by this subject while they were sunbathing on the beach. They described the subject as approximately 40 years old, [blank] feet tall, dressed in dark clothing. Sgt. Narlow dispatched Deputy Sheriff Raymond Land to interview these three girls that evening. (The report of Land's interview is attached.)
Reporting Officers spent the balance of the day and evening going through their investigative notes and issuing a statewide All Points Bulletin.
Monday, 9/29/69 Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan spent the majority of the morning interviewing numerous citizens and officers from other departments regarding this crime and similar crimes. (A general list of possible suspects was begun and they are noted on separate incident reports as to origin of information and description of suspects, attached.)
Reporting Officers were advised by Deputy Sheriff Ray Land who interviewed the three college girls, MISS [JOANNE], MISS [LINDA], and MISS [LINDA] that the information appeared to have some merit and advised that the three young ladies would be in the office in the afternoon for further interview.

9/29/69 1445 hours The three young ladies came into the office and were interviewed by Sgt. Lonergan, Sgt. Snook, and Capt. Donald Townsend.
Lonergan interviewed a MISS JOANNE MARIE, who, [age] years of age, DOB [blank], her address at the college is 114 Dauphine, Pacific Union College, home address South East 12th, College Place, Washington. MISS [JOANNE] advised R/O that on 9/27/69 at approximately 5:30 P.M. she and her two girlfriends parked their vehicle at a location two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. When they left their car they noticed a subject driving a late model silver blue Chevrolet, 2-door sedan, pull up behind them. What appeared to be a white male adult was sitting in the vehicle. They did not observe this subject leave the vehicle. The girls proceeded to the beach area and were sunbathing in their bikinis. After approximately one-half hour had passed, they observed what appeared to be the same subject standing within 40 or 50 feet of them, apparently observing them. This subject was described as 6' tall, weighing 200/210 lbs., muscular build, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing dark pants and a dark pullover shirt. The subject would stare at the three girls but when they looked up at him he would look away. The subject hung around the area for approximately 45 minutes and then the girls observed him walk up the hill. MISS [JOANNE] stated it was very doubtful that from his vantage point in the vehicle the subject could observe the three girls on the beach. She believes he waited in his vehicle and then followed them down after they were on the beach. MISS [JOANNE] further described the car as appearing very conservative. She stated the car did not appear to belong to any young person such as a teenager. She did state the car had California license plates but did not notice the number.
The other two young ladies, MISS [LINDA] and MISS [LINDA] were interviewed by Sgt. Snook and Capt. Donald Townsend.
MISS LINDA who was interviewed by R/O Det/Sgt. Snook, is a WFA, DOB [blank], home address Sunnyside Road, Sanitarium. She stated she left the Angwin area with two other girls, JOANNE and LINDA at approximately 2:45 P.M. 9/27/69. The girls drove through Pope Valley to Lake Berryessa where they parked their vehicle two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand. MISS [LINDA] stated she observed a subject go into the parking lot area to the south. Subject went past their vehicle and backed up so their rear bumpers were nearly touching. Vehicle described as a 1966 or 1967 light blue Chevrolet with California plates. Witness believes the vehicle was a 2-door sedan and described the headlights as being long rather than round. The rear window glass was tinted quite dark. Another vehicle from Angwin with Arizona plates was in the parking area and witness saw the occupants, a MISS DENISE BROWN and a MR. WAYNE HAIGHT.

to the beach and shortly thereafter noticed the male subject watching them from the edge of the trees. After about 30 minutes the subject came down by the beach and passed within 20 feet of witness as he walked from south to north. Subject was described by MISS [LINDA] as approximately 28 years of age, 6' to 6'2"" tall, 200/225 lbs., black hair possibly styled, with a part on left, rounded eyes, thin lips, medium nose, straight eyebrows, small ears, well built, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing a black short-sleeved sweater shirt, bunched up in front, and a white tee shirt hanging out in back, and dark trousers. The three girls left the area about 4:30 P.M. and the subject's vehicle was gone. Witnesses did not observe the subject either leave or get back into his vehicle.
MISS LINDA LEE was interviewed by R/O Capt. Donald Townsend. MISS [LINDA LEE] is a WFA, DOB [blank], address Howell Mountain Road, Angwin. MISS [LINDA LEE] is employed as a secretary of the college press. MISS [LINDA LEE] observed the same vehicle which was described as a late model Chevrolet, sky blue in color. The rear tail lights appeared to be long rather than round. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated they parked their vehicle at approximately 2:55 P.M. and observed the subject in his vehicle at that location. The girls proceeded to the beach and she, MISS [LINDA LEE], again noticed the subject about 30 to 45 minutes after they were at the beach. She noticed him standing on the bank approximately 45 yards from her location. She described the subject as 6 feet tall, stocky build, about 200 lbs., black short-sleeved sweater shirt, dark blue slacks, and straight dark hair neatly combed. She guessed his age at approximately 30 years. Subject had medium color skin and was not wearing glasses. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated she thought she saw a white belt around his back but it possibly was a tee shirt hanging out. She further stated that the man was fairly nice-looking, with a round face. She did not observe the subject leave the area in his vehicle.
9/29/69 - 1600 hours Reporting Officers Sgt. Narlow and Sgt. Lonergan were advised by Capt. Joseph Page that the female victim, MISS CECELIA SHEPARD, had just died at Queen of the Valley Hospital. Capt. Page, who is Chief Napa County Coroner, stated he would handle the case and contact DR. DE PETRIS who would perform the autopsy the next morning. Capt. Page further advised R/Os that the remains would be removed to Morrison Funeral Home where DR. DE PETRIS would complete the autopsy.
At 1945 hours 9/29/69, R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were contacted by Probation Officer H. B. Schotte. Mr. Schotte had observed the footprint design that R/Os had taken at the scene and stated he had knowledge of a possible similar shoe sole design. Mr. Schotte brought into the office a MR. BASSEL, address Sheveland, Apartment #7, Napa, California. MR. [BASSEL] is employed at Travis

Air Force Base and is a Flight Line Mechanic. He is a retired Master Sergeant in the United States Air Force. MR. [BASSEL] showed R/O a pair of Air Force chukker boots that belonged to him. He described these boots as being Government issue, issued to all Air Force personnel at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. They are primarily designed as a wing-walker shoe, however according to MR. [BASSEL] most Air Force personnel and many of the civilian personnel employed at Air Force bases had this type of shoe. The sole design of this shoe exactly matched the plaster cast design that Sgt. Snook had taken at the scene of the crime. It should be noted that Det/Sgt John Robertson had attempted to find a similar shoe design at the local shoe stores in the Napa area with negative results. (Refer Sgt. Robertson's supplementary report.) MR. [BASSEL] was asked if we could keep his shoes for identification purposes and he agreed. R/Os was also advised that this information regarding the type of footprint had not been released to the press or general public. MR. [BASSEL] stated he would cooperate with R/Os and keep this information confidential.
9/30/69, 0810 hours R/O Sgt. Lonergan received a telephone call from MISS MARILYN DENISE, 18 years of age, DOB [blank]. MISS [MARILYN] is a student at Pacific Union College and resides at Andre Hall, Room B-3. MISS [MARILYN] stated that about 5:15 P.M. Saturday, 9/27/69 she was in the Lake Berryessa area with a male companion, MR. JOHN, 22 years of age, also a student at Pacific Union College. She stated at this time they were parked on the Knoxville Road approximately one mile south of the Lake Berryessa Marina. She stated shortly after they parked the vehicle they observed the victims who were known to them, BRYAN HARTNELL and CECELIA SHEPARD, driving south on Knoxville Road in BRYAN's white Kharman Ghia.

advised that the cause of death was shock and loss of blood brought on by two main stab wounds.
9/30/69, 1430 hours R/O Det/Sgt. Kenneth Narlow contacted CAPT. at Travis Air Force Base and arranged for an interview with COL. and SGT. to take place on Wednesday morning, October 1st, 1969, at 9:00 A.M. R/Os wanted to talk to someone at Travis regarding the shoeprints that were found on the scene. The remainder of the day and evening was spent in answering phone calls from people who had possible knowledge of the crime.
Wednesday, 10/1/69 - 0900 hours Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow went to Travis Air Force Base and were present at an interview in Col. office, who is Commanding Officer in charge of base security. Also present at this meeting besides the aforementioned officers was LT. COL. of the Office of Special Investigation. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan advised the Air Force personnel present of the portion of the evidence we had discovered at the crime scene and asked them for assistance in locating where this type of shoe was sold or issued. LT. COL. advised that his office would assist assigned investigators in attempting to locate the source of the shoe.
Officers were directed to the Base Supply with the assistance of Special Agent DONALD of O.S.I., at which time it was determined through Base Supply that this shoe in question was of Government issue and that it was not kept in stock at Base Supply, however it was believed that the Sales Store had such an item. It was then explained that if a military person or civilian employee was determined to be in need of such an item, he first reported to the Base Supply, at which time he was issued a purchase requisition which he in turn took to the Sales Store and the type of shoe was issued to the individual and they in turn required the individual to sign the purchase requisition showing that he did receive the item. This purchase requisition states the type of shoe that the individual was to receive, however makes no reference as to size.
Assigned investigators, accompanied by Special Agent proceeded to the Sales Store located on Travis Air Force Base. After a short period of time R/Os located in stock a shoe fitting the identical description of the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast which officers had in their possession. The identical shoe with identical tread was found and a shoe bearing the closest measurements in the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast was measured and found to be a size 10 1/2 in military styling or a 10 1/2 D in civilian equivalent. It was determined through Air Force records that they were unable to furnish officers with the

data regarding the sales of this type shoe due to the fact that no recordings were made of the specific sizes, however purchase records indicate over the past 13 months approximately 100 pairs of this size shoe, namely 10 1/2, had been purchased and disposed of through sales. Air Force records indicate this type shoe is manufactured by the International Shoe Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, then shipped to Air Force Depot, Ogden, Utah, and from there shipped to the various military installations upon requisition orders.
10/1/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then proceeded to the Vallejo Police Department and met with Sgt. Jack Mullanax and Sgt. Duane Nilsson. Officers exchanged information regarding Vallejo's crime of 7/4/69 and our particular incident. Suspect information was exchanged and is listed in the separate suspect file.
Investigating Officers checked to determine the validity of the decoded message and as to how far the original cyphers had been decoded. It was then learned that the message had been decoded by at least two different sources, one being by MR. and MRS. HARDIN of Salinas and the other by the FBI in Washington. It was noted that these cyphers were broken independent of one another and the FBI confirmed the validity of the original decoded message. It was also learned that there was a small portion on the very end of the coded message that had not been decoded for reasons unknown.
The balance of the afternoon and evening Reporting Officers and other investigating officers met to exchange information and further discuss the evidence at hand.
Thursday, October 2nd, 1969, 0845 hours Reporting Officer Lonergan received a telephone call from Special Agent, OSI, Travis Air Force Base. Subject called to report that approximately 500 to 1,000 of that type of wing-walker shoe have been sold as surplus on the Base. This would be over and above those sold at the Sales Store. Agent further related he has the names of all the subjects who have purchased this item through surplus and will keep these names available to officers upon request.
The balance of the morning was spent searching fingerprint evidence and answering phone calls from possible witnesses.
Thursday, 10/2/69, 1400 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan attended the funeral services for victim CECELIA SHEPARD. These services were held at the Pacific Union College Church, Angwin, California. Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan positioned themselves

inside the church in order to observe all persons who viewed the services and the remains of victim CECELIA SHEPARD. Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Sgt. Thomas Butler, and Detective Ronald Montgomery of the Napa Police Department positioned themselves outside the church and photographed all persons entering and leaving the services. This included individual photographs and group scenes. Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow also attended the graveside services at the St. Helena Cemetery in St. Helena.
Friday, 10/3/69 - Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Richard Lonergan contacted JAMES, Napa State Hospital, advised him to set up an interview with a patient who is a possible suspect in our case. The patient is identified as GRIFFIN RAYMOND FRANKLIN, WMA, 20 yrs. of age, DOB [blank], 6'2"", 223 lbs. [JAMES] had previously reported that this subject had left the hospital on a pass Friday evening, 9/26/69, and returned to the hospital Monday afternoon, 9/29/69. This subject also had spent time in the Air Force and was discharged from the Air Force in January 1969 for psychiatric problems. According to the doctors at the hospital, this subject was capable of committing this type of a crime. R/O in the presence of JAMES and Security Officer PHIL RYAN interviewed subject FRANKLIN. FRANKLIN was very cooperative and talkative to R/O and went over his activities the prior weekend. Briefly stated, MR. FRANKLIN, whose parents live in Vallejo, never left the Vallejo area that weekend and stayed around home talking with his mother, stepfather, and three brothers. After interviewing subject, it was the opinion of R/O Sgt. Lonergan that this subject was not the responsible. He had a definite very fast manner of speaking which was completely opposed to the victim's statement concerning the suspect's voice. R/O also contacted the mother of the suspect, a MRS. OPAL at Hollywood Avenue, Vallejo. MRS. OPAL stated more or less the exact same thing that her son had stated as to his whereabouts that weekend. It appears that this subject has a reliable alibi as to his activities and had no access to a vehicle that weekend. This subject was cleared as far as this crime is concerned.
The balance of the morning and afternoon was spent by R/Os Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan going over physical evidence and dictating reports.

9/28/69 12:30 P.M. Reporting Officer John Robertson, Det/Sgt., interviewed one of two victims who were each stabbed numerous times by an unknown assailant. Victim CECELIA SHEPARD and victim BRYAN HARTNELL both had been placed in the Queen of the Valley Hospital intensive care unit. Victim SHEPARD had surgery performed on her earlier in the morning (9/28/69) and was unable to be questioned by the Reporting Officer, however Dr. Ludwig gave permission for victim HARTNELL to be interviewed.
Although victim HARTNELL was heavily sedated, he was able to give R/O a verbal statement. (Note: R/O taped electrically the interview with victim HARTNELL.) Victim HARTNELL related the following.
He had known CECELIA SHEPARD for some time, they were good friends, and she had come to the Napa County area to spend the weekend. She and a female companion, DALORA LEE, Aspen, Loma Linda, San Bernardino County, Calif. (phone Ext. 2155) had driven from Southern California and were to drive back Sunday, 9/28/69. Victim stated he and MISS SHEPARD drove to Lake Berryessa, picked a large tree near the shore line where they decided to lie down and enjoy the scenery. While lying on the ground, victim HARTNELL stated he heard a noise and asked MISS SHEPARD if she could hear anything or see anything behind a tree not far from where the couple were lying. MISS SHEPARD told victim HARTNELL she could see a man behind the tree. HARTNELL asked her what he was doing. MISS SHEPARD stated she couldn't tell. HARTNELL stated he (suspect) then came from behind the tree. MISS SHEPARD said, ""Oh my God, he has a gun!""
Victim HARTNELL stated the man approached the couple, aiming a black steel automatic pistol. The suspect stated he needed a car and money. Suspect stated his car was ""hot"" and he wanted victim HARTNELL's car keys. Victim HARTNELL stated he began talking with the suspect, telling the suspect he had no money, only a small amount of change, also that if the suspect was really in need of assistance HARTNELL would attempt to help him. The suspect told victim to get on the ground. Suspect then had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him. HARTNELL stated he attempted to keep the suspect engaged in conversation while suspect was tying the victims.
HARTNELL further stated the suspect was described as follows: Wearing a black hooded mask (cloth), covering suspect's entire head and shoulders, coming down almost to suspect's waist. Victim stated on front of the four-cornered type mask (similar to paper bag in style) there was a symbol, the symbol described as white, approximately 3 x 3 inches in diameter, with a symmetrical cross. Also on the eyelets of the mask was a pair of clip-on sunglasses, the glasses clipped to the eyelets. Victim stated he could also see hair through the mask's eyelets and observed the hair to be dark brown.
Victim stated suspect was wearing a light-weight windbreaker, dark blue or black, pleated slacks (old-fashioned type). Victim could not remember what type of shoes or anything about suspect's hands, could not remember if suspect was wearing gloves.
Victim thought suspect was possibly 20 to 30 years of age by voice concept. Victim stated suspect was 5'8"" to 6', 225-250 lbs., dark brown hair, eyes unknown, sloppy dresser, stomach hanging over trousers. Suspect spoke with some

type of drawl, but victim stated it was not a Southern drawl, did not really know what type of drawl, but thought the man was not well educated, but did not feel he was illiterate either. Victim said suspect's voice was moderate in sound, that is, not high or low pitched.
Suspect told victim he was sent to (?) Lodge State Prison (possibly Deer Lodge State Prison), Montana, for a killing. While there (in prison) he killed a guard while escaping. Suspect also told victims he was heading for Mexico, told victim he was flat broke.
Victim observed cut-up rope in suspect's rear pocket (trouser's), also stated he was wearing a knife in a case (on belt) on his right side, near front of trousers. Knife description: Appeared to be a long bread knife, 12"" long blade, 3/4"" wide, hardwood handle, 2 brass rivets holding handle in place, cotton surgical tape wrapped approximately 1"" around handle of knife. Knife case possibly made of wood.
Victim asked suspect if suspect's gun was loaded. Suspect removed magazine from handle of pistol and showed victim a bullet removed from gun, bullet described as a possible .45 caliber. Victim did not know what caliber the pistol was.
Suspect had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him, suspect then tied victim SHEPARD's hands, then re-tied HARTNELL's hands, then tied both victims' ankles together, had victims lie on their stomachs. HARTNELL stated suspect said, ""I'm getting nervous."" This was when suspect was tying MISS SHEPARD'S hands, in fact HARTNELL stated suspect got real shaky when he was tying MISS SHEPARD's hands.
Victim HARTNELL then stated that without warning the suspect plunged his knife into the back of HARTNELL. Suspect did this repeatedly, HARTNELL stated he thinks six times. HARTNELL stated he pretended to be dead and the suspect went over to MISS SHEPARD and stabbed MISS SHEPARD repeatedly in the back, and when MISS SHEPARD turned her body over (on back), suspect stabbed her in the lower abdomen. Victim stated suspect stabbed MISS SHEPARD much worse than him. Suspect went into some sort of frenzy when stabbing MISS SHEPARD.
Victim HARTNELL stated suspect left the area after the stabbing. Victim HARTNELL hailed a boat (off shore) and told the man in the boat the couple needed help badly. Victim stated the boat left the area and he (victim) attempted to get help by crawling and walking to the road. (Victim believed he had walked to the road, however had not gone too far from his wounded companion.)
Victim stated he thought suspect had been with the couple for approximately fifteen (15) minutes from time of observing suspect until suspect departed. Victim stated suspect did not take his wallet, although when MISS SHEPARD was tying victim HARTNELL's hands, she reached in his pocket and threw his wallet to suspect. Suspect did not take the wallet or victim's car keys.
Victim stated a man in a pickup truck found him on the road and called an ambulance. Victim stated he estimated one hour in time was involved between the time he and MISS SHEPARD were stabbed until help arrived.
MISS SHEPARD is listed in critical condition.

Sgt. ROBERTSON stated that Mr. HARTNELL was heavily sedated but was able to give a verbal statement pertaining to the attack at Lake Berrysessa. The interview was taped and reads as follows:
""INTERVIEW OF JOHN ROBERTSON, DET/SGT., NAPA COUNTY SHERIFF's DEPARTMENT, WITH BRYAN CALVIN HARTNELL (NSO CASE #105907) AT QUEEN OF THE VALLEY HOSPITAL ON SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1969 (TRANSCRIBED FROM TAPE RECORDING BY M. FEURLE):
""J.R. Can you give me this fellow's description and tell me what happened?
""B.H. So many people have been asking me... I hope...
""J.R. Well sometimes when we're repetitious, I know it happens to me, I tell the same thing over and over and over, and sometimes I might vary a little, and if you do...
""B.H. Shall I just start out and tell you what happened?
""J.R. I don't want to tire you out.
""B.H. I just don't want this to happen again to anybody... Of course he might have his reasons, I don't know...
""J.R. Okay. Go right ahead. Start right from the beginning. What happened?
""B.H. Okay. This girl came out from school, I used to go with her two years ago, and she's now going to another school, and she came up to visit some friends and we were having dinner at the school cafeteria, and I said, 'Well, are you doing anything special this afternoon?' and she said, 'Why?', and I said, 'I don't know. We could go out and either go for a walk, go to San Francisco, or, you know, just...', 'cause we used to be good friends. We used to have a good friendship. And so it got too late by the time we got around to what we were going to do. We had to stop in St. Helena for a couple items and then we had to cart a couple kids home and stuff, and by the time we finally got around to it, it was getting late, and I thought going to San Francisco 'd rush you, you know, because by the time we got back for worship... And so we went out to Berryessa, and there was this one place I used to go out... we used to all the time, you know... and I couldn't find it. And so I figured Ah, forget it, and this looks like as good a place as any. So I parked the car, there were no other cars there. I had a Kharman Ghia, '56, white, with a black vinyl top, and it's in pretty

... ""good-looking shape. But we parked there on the road's edge and we talked Oh it must be about a quarter of a mile to down to the place where we went. We had... (unintelligible) peninsula, it's an an island I guess during the wetter season, You can see where it was levee... And so that looked like a lot... there was a big spreading tree up there. There were two of them, really, one was a little bigger than the other. We took the one that was out on the point.
""It was really beautiful out there. We were sitting on top... I lay down on my back and she lay down on her stomach beside me, you know, kind of resting her head on my shoulder, and we were talking, you know, kind of reminiscing about old times, and stuff. And I heard these rustling leaves, and I said, 'You have your specs on. Why don't you see what the deal is over there?' And she says, 'Oh, it's some man.' And I said, 'Is he alone?' and she said, 'Yeah... (unintelligible)...' and she says, 'Well he just stepped behind the tree.' And I said, 'What's the idea of that? To take a leak?' You know, 'cause that's the only thing I could think of, just step behind a tree. And so I says, 'Well, keep looking and tell me what happens,' and she says, 'Oh my God, he's got a gun!' and squeezed my arm and
""And so he came out, and of course still actually I wasn't... There's some things you really wouldn't mind having happen, just for the experience of it. You know I thought, Well I only got fifty cents on me. It's worth all of that having it happen. I didn't think about another angle. So I talked to him, you know. I said, 'Well listen, Mac, (you know I'm in the sociologist field, you know, I'm pre-law, with history and psych.) You know I've read about the criminal mind and everything, you know. I thought well maybe the guy really does need help, you know. I says, 'There's no strings attached.' I says, 'I don't have any money right now but if you need help that badly I can help you out in another way maybe.' And he says, 'Nah.. time's running short,' he says, ''cause I just got out of... some prison in Montana, I don't know what the name of it is. Feathers? Do you know what the name of it is? I'll see if it sounds familiar. Fern or Feathers? It's some double name, like Fern Lock or something...
""J.R. It's Lodge..

""B.H. Oh yeah, yeah, Lodge. At least we know we're together on that.
""J.R. Mountain Lodge Prison, or something of that nature...
""B.H. Yeah. You know he said he broke out and had to kill a guard getting out. And I said, 'Well, man, I mean actually I don't mean to call your bluff or anything, but wouldn't you rather be stuck on a stealing charge than a threat of homicide?' you know? And he says, 'Well just don't start playing hero on me.' You know, 'Don't try to grab the gun,' 'cause I didn't really figure the gun was loaded. I always thought it would be empty. I've heard a lot of times that this is what they do just as a bluff, but I decided not to call his bluff after he really, you know... I told him, 'You know you're really wasting your time with me. I've got a billfold and this much change and that's it.' And he said, he told the girl, 'Go tie him up. I'd feel much better if you were tied up.' And she tied a couple of loose knots on me, so I made it look kind of tight... (unintelligible)... you know, just for a second, and he said 'Go ahead.' And I whispered to her, 'You know I think I can get that gun.' And I said, 'Do you mind?' and she got kind of fearful about it, so I figured since there's two lives involved, not just mine, I won't do it.
""So I let her tie me up on the wrists again, and he tied her up, - terribly tight, you know, real... (unintelligible) ... put his gun away, and we were talking and all, bantering, you know, basically. I was thinking, anything I can do to help, by the way just to keep the conversation going... Suddenly he was taking it all seriously, you know... So I was starting out and finally he said, 'Okay, lay down. I've got her tied up', you know... He strung a rope between our ankles in the rear, so we were like this, you know, on our stomachs, tied...
""J.R. You both facing the ground...
""B.H. Right. And, oh, this was before. I got sort of ahead. So anyway, he said, 'Get down,' and I said, 'Oh come on! We could freeze to death!' I said that a couple, three times, and he said, 'GET DOWN! RIGHT NOW!' He got a little pushed off at me. So I got down and then he finished tying her up and clonked her down, - and then he goes... Sswhooosh (a sound with his mouth)... (unintelligible)

""And so I said, 'Do you have bullets in there?' And so he pulled out the clip and showed me that he did. The bullets were about this long, I can remember, and about this fat, and they had the regular red cap on it, about this long. Maybe that doesn't give you any better description of the gun or not. I don't know. And it came out of the heel, the grip, you know. It slipped out from the bottom.
""And now, to backtrack a bit. I was really trying to see what he looked like, you know. He had on pleated pants, these old type of suit pants, you know, and they were either black or dark blue, I can't remember now. And I can't remember what he was wearing for shoes. But he had on this cotton coat, You've seen the kind, that you just turn the collar up once, there's a zipper down the front, you know. They're real light, super-thin, you know...
""J.R. Kind of a windbreaker...
""B.H. Yeah, like a windbreaker. And it's got this blue, this little collar, sometimes the guys wear them standing up, you know.
""J.R. What color was that?
""B.H. That was dark blue. And I don't know. Maybe he had something in his pouch. I just took it as being a... as being a... you know, he was stout 'cause he looked kind of heavy. I think he was weighing two and a quarter, two fifty, somewhere in there. And I got kind of a look at his hair. His voice... I can remember... almost like I'd heard it before. You know there's some drawls that a lot of people have similar. And... almost as if I'd heard it before... couldn't think where.
""I gave that one up, I just gave it up on that angle. I looked through his hair. I kind of looked like it was combed, you know, like this.. it was a brownish, you know, dark brown hair.
""And this mask he had on. It was ingeniously devised. It was... he had four corners at the top, like the top of a paper sack... black. It came down, came down, with the front panel about to here, and a kind of a thing that came over the shoulders, you know, and then the same thing down the back, straight down. And in the front he had a circle with a symmetrical cross in the middle. You know what I mean by a symmetrical cross?

""J.R. Um hum (affirmative).
""B.H. The ends of the cross hung out about this far on each of the... you know, where it came out. The circle was this much... like this... and then it was like this, you see... hung out on the end, over the edge of the circle.
""And he had clip-on sunglasses... it was hard to tell. You know, the sunglasses you clip on when you're wearing glasses, eyeglasses, He had those clipped on. I'm pretty sure... I don't think he had glasses, though. I think he just had these clipped on to his suit... you know, that little mask.
""And I don't know how tall he was. Maybe 5-8 or maybe 5-10, 6 feet, somewhere in there. I'm a very poor judge of height because of my height. I have no meaning, you know. It's always down, you know. It can never be up...
""And so I saw him put away his gun, and I was turning to say something to Celia, and all of a sudden I felt my back... just... no, I think I saw him pull it out.. I don't remember... I think I saw him whip out his knife and just start stabbing me in the back... CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP! I was just (makes a gutteral sound)... you know that kind of a sound... and Celia turned to see why I was (repeats gutteral sound), you know, and she just about fainted. She went hysterical... (unintelligible) ... and when he finally stopped... I mean he went over and... The doctor says there's six in the back, six wounds on my back. You ought to confirm that. One I've got went clear through the lung. I've got it draining. I did drain a couple pints of blood out as soon as I got here. I lost an awful lot of blood, I guess.
""We were down... I mean it was absolutely no question in my mind... when a person gets stabbed as many times as we did... we were going to die. I mean there'd be no reason to question it. But somehow I, you know, started (unintelligible)... I just knew there was too much I had to live for. I mean really it does happen... about getting depressed and everything... when you're young you always think about these things... you know you think about it... and when you've got someone forcing your hand, oh well, there was a lot of things I had to do. And what really kept me going... you know my parents are pretty Christian. I haven't been too much of a Christian myself... but if you believe in the principle you ask God to help you. Another thing, What was my only strength was knowing two things. One, that I did not want to die, and two, that I felt that whatever was

""going to be was going to be, but I was going to try my damnedest to stay alive. And so, like I say, - before I left her I kissed her, and I said, 'Well,' I says, 'I'm gonna try to get help.'
""There was a boat kept circling around out there in the lake and we started yelling at it and finally it came within about 100 yards of the shore and turned off its motor and stayed there watching us for about fifteen minutes, and we were just screaming hysterically, trying to get their attention, you know, to come over here. Oh, I don't know, I guess they were afraid that the guy might be there in the bushes and they were liable to get choked or something. So finally he came up a little closer. I didn't have my glasses on... I was just swaying, you know... and I had gotten one of her hands free before they came, and so I kept trying to get her to untie me, and she couldn't, she was too weak, she said.
""So finally I just kept hollering and hollering, and she said, 'Turn around and let's see if I can do it again.' She finally got it. My hands and my feet were just pure numbness... they're still numb but I'm sure that will go 'way. But I finally got... (unintelligible)... untie her so she could kind of relax out. 'Cause it was a terrible position, you know, upon our stomachs... (unintelligible)...
""And so I started to go for help. I finally got myself fairly reconciled. I wasn't too worried about dying, if that was what was going to happen, but I knew I had to keep pushing on. I had to force myself into staying alive because it was... I could just see myself... you know, all sort of waves would come over... I just (coughing sound)... (unintelligible)... 'Well, you're not gonna give up this easy', you know. And, like I say, I just kept believing that God would do everything the best, if the thing was gonna happen, but I couldn't see any reason why my dying would be the best good. So I just played along with that.
""I just started to walk toward the road... everything blacked out on me... my visual... my mind was never blacked out, but my visual was. So I lay down... My eyes started to come open... I just saw a haze of trees, you know. In a little while I got up and went another twenty feet, and then the same thing happened... (unintelligible)... and sat down. Next thing I went clear... (unintelligible)... the road, and by that time I just fell... I just... I was trying so hard to go far I just went too far. Finally I heard this pickup

""coming... I was just laying alongside the road, and that's where this guy picked me up.
""They weren't in any hurry at all, it didn't seem like, you know, but they finally called an ambulance. About fifteen minutes later it came... (unintelligible)... but I still believe... I've got feeling... starting to get a little pain to come through. But from the minute that knife blade went in, it was nothing but pure shock from there on. I just did not expect it. I didn't expect that he would do that. That was a variable I had completely left out. And I guess he just took off running after we started running. I don't know. I never saw him before and hope not to see him again... at least outside of a courtroom.
""It's hard for me to explain much more. I mean I'm trying to give you a kind of example of his technique. He had some rope cut up in his back pocket. And he had a ... well, I thought it was a police automatic because it was in one of these black leather cases, you know...
""J.R. Was it in a smooth case, or did it have a basket weave like..
""B.H. Can I have my glasses? Oh, they're not here. It was a smooth one, though.
""J.R. Did he have this hood down to about the middle of his chest?
""B.H. No, about like... well, I'll show you... Here... his stomach.. You know I could see his... (voice fades away)
""J.R. Okay. You said his hair looked dark brown. How could you see his hair?
""B.H. 'Cause I saw it from where those goggles fit. I looked so closely to find out. And when he turned you know they kind of flittered... I could see his hair. It looked kind of greasy.
""J.R. Now was he as heavy as I am?
""B.H. Well I can't say 'cause he wasn't wearing those type of clothes. They were sloppy clothes, you know. And he just had on this old pair of pleated pants. I don't know... How tall are you?
""J.R. I'm about five eleven.

""B.H. Well, like I say, he was dressed kind of sloppily, you know. His pants real tight up here and his stomach kind of pouched a bit, you know. I don't know... it's hard to say 'cause I can't judge you with being in a suit and all, you know, and him not being professional-looking at all. He could be about the same. It's hard to say. He was so sloppily dressed.
""J.R. Bryan, you also mentioned a drawl. Well not a drawl, an accent.
""B.H. It was just something... I guess his way of talking. It was something I couldn't repeat. It's like a song. Sometimes you know what you're going to say but you just can't sing the melody worth a darn.
""J.R. Did he have a throaty voice or a high pitched?
""B.H. In between. But it was just a unique way of talking.
""J.R. Did he sound like an educated man?
""B.H. Heck no! I don't think so.
""J.R. Did he sound illiterate?
""B.H. No. He didn't sound that way either. He just impressed me as being rather low class. The reason was because of his clothes, you know.
""J.R. Did you lose consciousness when he stabbed you at any time? Did you observe him stab Cecelia?
""B.H. Yeah...
""J.R. What did he say after...
""B.H. He stabbed her a bunch of times in the back. After she turned around, he got her once in the groin and one in the arm I think. He kind of went a little more hog-wild with her than with me. I faked dead... like that... I didn't want him to come back and give me some more.
""J.R. So you were pretty sure he thought you were dead when he finished working on you?

""J.R. Was she in a lot of pain, did she tell you?
""B.H. Oh yeah. She was more weak at the time... (unintelligible).. from the religious angle. I told her I sure as heck wasn't going to have any deathbed conversion. 'No,' she says... (unintelligible)... I mean it was just like you were gonna die and had a few things to say. But I felt more and more I wasn't losing strength as much... (unintelligible)... that I thought I could cope with...
""J.R. What you did was a courageous thing. It was a terrible thing to have happen to anyone.
""B.H. Well there was nothing we could do. We were kind of at the mercy of him. I mean I wanted to get that gun... (unintelligible)... There was a time I think I could have gotten it...
""J.R. Did it appear to be a .45 to you? An automatic?
""B.H. It was about this long... along the stock... and had a wood edge on it, you know.. on either side...
""J.R. Handles.
""B.H. Yeah...yeah...
""J.R. Did the bullet look anything like that?
""B.H. No. It was kind of like this, only it was gold, and this part here came out along with this and then round the gold, round the blunt end. Not quite that blunt-ended, though.
""J.R. Was it fat? Fatter than this?
""B.H. Yeah, I think it was a little fatter. But it was gold, you know. And I didn't see any of this here. There was a part where it crimped... Well, almost like that 22, short, only a lot bigger. It was about like this length, maybe more stubby.

""B.H. ""Let's take the suspect. His hands... I don't remember if they had gloves on or not. I can't remember now. I keep thinking that he had gloves on. I can't figure how he tied us... Let's ask Celia, she probably knows about that.
""J.R. Did he swear? Did he use any profane language or obscenity?
""B.H. I don't think so. If he did it was no more than I was using at the time. I don't think he used any obscenity. He might have used a swear word or something, you know. That wasn't striking to me...
""J.R. Do you have any idea what his motive might have been? Money?
""B.H. Money. He said he was going to go to Mexico and he was flat broke.
""J.R. Did he search you after he...
""B.H. Heck no! Very unprofessional. He didn't even end up taking that loose change and didn't even take my billfold.
""J.R. Why did he stab you when you weren't fighting him off or anything?
""B.H. I couldn't. Even if I'd have wanted to. I was laying on my stomach...
""J.R. So what would have been the purpose of him to stab you, do you think?
""B.H. Well I (unintelligible)...but I think he got rattled... (unintelligible)... very, very nervous. His hands were shaking... (unintelligible)... Are you nervous?
""J.R. I'm just curious. If you could write me that symbol you were telling me about. Do you think you could draw me a picture of that even without your glasses?

MR. BYRD advised that MISS JUDY was a student at the college and had left the college earlier in the afternoon, driving a yellow Datsun. At 2135 hours Reporting Officers put out an All Points Bulletin around the City and County of Napa for this above described vehicle. At 2137 hours Officers received permission to interview the victim BRYAN HARTNELL who was taken to the X-Ray Room for x-rays. Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Lonergan attempted to interview BRYAN HARTNELL while in the presence of DONALD JUDAH and hospital attendant CLIFFORD MEAGHER. Sgt. Narlow was called away to answer a phone before the interview got under way. HARTNELL appeared to be in extreme pain and also appeared to be in shock. Reporting Officer Lonergan introduced himself to HARTNELL and asked him to give us any information he had on his assailant. HARTNELL stated that the assailant was wearing a black ceremonial type hood, square on top, and appeared to be heavy-set, between 200 and 250 pounds. He also stated his assailant had approached both him and MISS SHEPARD with a gun but had stabbed them with a long knife. HARTNELL further stated the gun was in a black holster and the knife was in a sheath. He stated that the attacker was wearing dark clothing, dark jacket and dark pants. HARTNELL further stated that the gun was an automatic pistol and the knife had a black handle and appeared to be homemade.
It should be noted that HARTNELL was very groggy and he was very difficult to interview at that time. Subject was re-interviewed the next day by Det/Sgt. Robertson and gave more complete details. (The report of Sgt. Robertson's interview is attached.)
At 2215 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan left the Queen of the Valley Hospital after advising Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and William Munk to take charge of the clothing of the victims and any other evidence from the victims when it was released from the hospital. Munk and Brambrink were also advised to stand by at the hospital as a security measure until other arrangements could be made.
As Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan were arriving at the Napa County Sheriff's Office, they were advised by the Napa Police Department that they had located MISS JUDY in the downtown Napa area and were bringing her to the Napa County Sheriff's Office. MISS [JUDY] was interviewed by Lonergan and Narlow at the Napa County Sheriff's Office.

HARTNELL and CECELIA SHEPARD earlier in the afternoon. She stated that they all left Pacific Union College together at approximately 1:00 P.M. and went to a rummage sale in the City of St. Helena. She stated that BRYAN had bought a T.V. set at the rummage sale and had to transport it back to his room at Pacific Union College. She stated he left CECELIA at the rummage sale as there was not enough room in his car. MISS [JUDITH] stated BRYAN returned to the St. Helena area and picked up CECELIA at approximately 2:00 P.M. MISS [JUDITH] stated as far as she knew, both BRYAN and CECELIA were planning to go to San Francisco when they left her in St. Helena. MISS [JUDITH] stated she had no knowledge of any plans that BRYAN and CECELIA were making to go to the Lake Berryessa area. MISS [JUDITH] stated the last time she saw BRYAN and CECELIA was approximately 2:00 P.M. in the afternoon.
The interview with MISS [JUDITH] was terminated at that point.
Det/Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow then proceeded to Lake Berryessa and arrived at the scene of the crime, which was approximately a mile and a half north of Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters, at 2354 hours. The scene was being preserved by uniformed officers and under the direct control of Deputy Sheriffs David Collins and Ray Land. The investigating officers were briefed by Officers Collins and Land as to what had taken place prior to our arrival. Officers observed a 1956 white Kharman Ghia with a black vinyl top, Oregon license plate 4 U 2040. Investigating officers were shown footprints in dirt area and tire tracks, both believed to have been left by responsible. Investigating officers awaited the arrival of Sgt. Tom Butler who had been called to take photographs of the crime scene area and Sgt. Hal Snook, criminalist for collection and preservation of physical evidence. R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were advised by Park Ranger Dennis Land who had also arrived at the scene that it was possible to get to the beach area by vehicle from a locked gate approximately one-half mile south of the victim's vehicle. Officers proceeded to the area and arrived at the footpath approximately halfway between the scene of the crime at the beach and the victim's vehicle on the road. At that point, after a brief examination of the footpath area, officers discovered a similar footprint on the footpath to that found at the scene of the victim's vehicle. At that point, due to the lateness and darkness of the hour, Reporting Officers decided to completely secure the area and make a thorough search of the scene at first light. Officers then exited the crime scene area in the same manner and locked the aforementioned gate leading to this vicinity. Investigating officers along with Park Ranger Dennis Land went to the Berryessa Park Headquarters.

Among the various aforementioned items believed to belong to the victims, were numerous strands of white plastic line cut into various assorted lengths, some of which had what appeared to be bloodstains. These items were subsequently turned over to Det/Sgt. Hal Snook for preservation.
Assigned investigators then proceeded back to the scene where the victim's car was parked and assisted Sgt. Snook in the making of the plaster casts. At approximately 0245 hours Sgt. Lonergan, having previously obtained the keys to the vehicle from BRYAN HARTNELL's property at Queen of the Valley Hospital, drove the white Kharman Ghia to the maintenance shop at Berryessa Park Headquarters. The vehicle was parked inside of the maintenance shop building and the building was secured for the evening by investigating officers with the assistance of Park Ranger Dennis Land. Assigned Investigators then returned back to the scene where the victim's vehicle had been previously parked and awaited the arrival of Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and Mel Fechter who were assigned to security duty in the crime scene area. At approximately 0300 hours officers assumed their duties at the crime scene area and the security was placed under the direction of Deputy Allen Brambrink. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then returned to their respective residences with plans to continue the investigation at daybreak.
9/28/69 0700 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene at Lake Berryessa area, accompanied by Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Capt. Donald Townsend, and Sgt. James Munk. Officers then assisted Det/Sgt. Snook in tracking the footprints from the vehicle to the scene of the crime by the beach area. (The location and preservation of aforementioned footprints will be detailed in a supplementary evidence report by Sgt. Snook.)
At 0800 hours Reporting Officers Lonergan and Narlow received information via Park Headquarters that a DR. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his son would like to talk to them at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop regarding a possible suspect in this crime. At 0912 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan contacted DR. R. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his 16-yr. old son DAVID LEE RAYFIELD at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop. DR. RAYFIELD gave a home address of Los Gatos, California. DR. RAYFIELD stated that about 6:30 P.M. the previous evening he and his son had parked their car north of Park Headquarters in the general area of the

crime scene. They stated they went down towards the beach area when DAVID RAYFIELD noticed a white male adult subject walking in the area, described as about 5'10"", heavy build, wearing dark trousers, a dark shirt with red in it, long sleeves. He stated this subject was carrying nothing in his hands and was apparently just walking alongside the hill area about halfway between the road and the lake. DAVID further stated that when the subject observed him he turned around and walked up the hill in a southerly direction. DR. RAYFIELD and his son stated that they did not notice a vehicle in the area of their vehicle and only this subject at a distance of about 100 yards. They also advised there was a man with two young boys in the area shooting B-B guns, but they did not know if this man saw the subject or not. This location was approximately 8/10ths of a mile from the scene of the victim's vehicle. In the opinion of R/Os, it is unlikely, unless this male subject had a vehicle in the immediate area, he could have traversed the area to the scene of the crime on foot. There are four coves of water between the scene of the crime and the area where the doctor saw the subject. The interview with DR. RAYFIELD and his son was terminated at that point.
At 1000 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene of the crime and further assisted Sgt. Snook in the collecting and locating of evidence.
At 1320 hours 9/28/69, R/Os interviewed Ranger Sgt. William White at Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters. White was interviewed as to his activities before and during his part in locating the victims the night before. White stated at approximately 1855 hours 9/27/69 he was on routine patrol around the Lake Berryessa area when he received a call from Park Headquarters to proceed to the Rancho Monticello Resort where a person was reporting a possible stabbing. 
White stated he proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort where he was contacted by ARCHIE E. WHITE, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG. RONALD FONG advised him that he had seen a male and a female victim on the beach area south of Rancho Monticello Resort, hollering that they had been stabbed. Ranger Sgt. White, accompanied by ARCHIE WHITE, ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the beach area via speedboat owned by ARCHIE WHITE. When they arrived on the beach they observed a young female lying on the ground with what appeared to be numerous stab wounds. Ranger Sgt. White stated that the female appeared to be in a great deal of pain. White stated as they discovered the female victim, Ranger Dennis Land arrived at the scene in his pickup truck, carrying a male victim who also appeared to have numerous stab wounds. White stated he immediately radioed in and had Park Headquarters call the Sheriff's Office to dispatch an ambulance and a Deputy. White stated he attempted to interview both the boy and girl victims while awaiting

arrival of the ambulance. According to White, the male victim said that a male subject approached them, wearing a hood, dressed in dark clothing. The subject was carrying what appeared to be an automatic pistol and stated that he wanted their money and car keys. According to White, the male victim related to him that the subject advised him he was an ex-con out of Colorado and was en route to Mexico. Suspect stated he had to tie them up, and after they were tied the responsible stated, ""I'm going to have to stab you."" White further related that the male victim advised the responsible, ""Stab me first, I can't stand to see her stabbed first."" The male victim then advised that the responsible stabbed him numerous times in the back and then stabbed the girl.
The female victim advised White that she could not see the responsible's face as a hood was covering all of his head. She also advised White that the suspect had what appeared to be clip-on sunglasses to cover his eyes. Ranger Sgt. White stated that this is the most he could get out of either victim as they were both in great shock and pain. White stated that he noticed a lot of blood near the girl's groin area. The interview with Ranger Sgt. White was terminated at that point.
9/28/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort and interviewed MR. ARCHIE E. WHITE. (It should be noted that ARCHIE E. WHITE and ELIZABETH WHITE are no relation to Ranger Sgt. White.) ARCHIE E. WHITE is the owner of the Boat Repair Shop at Rancho Monticello Resort. He lives at the Resort. Also interviewed were MR. WHITE's wife, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE. MR. and MRS. WHITE advised that they were contacted by RONALD FONG who advised them he had just observed what appeared to be a male and a female subject lying on the beach south of the Rancho Monticello Resort, covered with blood. FONG advised them that the couple had shouted out to him that they had been stabbed and robbed. MRS. WHITE immediately called Park Headquarters and Ranger Sgt. William White arrived at the Resort a short time later. MR. and MRS. WHITE, accompanied by Ranger Sgt. Bill White and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the scene area in one of MR. WHITE's ski boats. When they arrived on the scene, they observed a young female wearing a sweater dress lying on the beach, covered with blood. When they approached the area she was on her elbows and knees, rocking back and forth as if in great pain. MRS. WHITE stated she immediately attempted to make the victim more comfortable and tried to calm her down until the ambulance arrived. MRS. WHITE stated the girl advised him, ""He was a man with a hood... His face was covered... He was wearing black pants... It hurts, it

hurts."" MRS. WHITE then advised after the female had regained her composure, she told her the man had asked for money but didn't take any. She said she hadn't been raped. MRS. WHITE further advised that the female victim told her that the responsible was wearing glasses, with dark clip-on sunglasses over the hood. She told her that the responsible had a black pistol. MR. ARCHIE WHITE stated he overheard the male victim advise someone that the responsible was wearing gloves. MR. and MRS. WHITE further advised that this is the only information either victim gave them on the responsible, and that they spent the balance of the time attempting to make the victim more comfortable until the arrival of the ambulance.
After the interview with MR. and MRS. WHITE, Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan returned to the Napa County Sheriff's Office.
At 1620 hours R/O Det/Sgt. Narlow was contacted by a DEAN of the Pacific Union College in Angwin. DEAN advised that three young ladies, students at the college, might possibly have information as to a suspect in the attack at Lake Berryessa. The young ladies were identified as MISS JOANNE, MISS LINDA, and MISS LINDA. DEAN advised that these girls had been in the Lake Berryessa area from about 3:00 P.M. to 4:30 P.M. the previous Saturday afternoon. They had observed a male subject in a late model, silver blue Chevrolet, two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. DEAN advised that the girls had told him they were observed out of the car by this subject while they were sunbathing on the beach. They described the subject as approximately 40 years old, [blank] feet tall, dressed in dark clothing. Sgt. Narlow dispatched Deputy Sheriff Raymond Land to interview these three girls that evening. (The report of Land's interview is attached.)
Reporting Officers spent the balance of the day and evening going through their investigative notes and issuing a statewide All Points Bulletin.
Monday, 9/29/69 Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan spent the majority of the morning interviewing numerous citizens and officers from other departments regarding this crime and similar crimes. (A general list of possible suspects was begun and they are noted on separate incident reports as to origin of information and description of suspects, attached.)
Reporting Officers were advised by Deputy Sheriff Ray Land who interviewed the three college girls, MISS [JOANNE], MISS [LINDA], and MISS [LINDA] that the information appeared to have some merit and advised that the three young ladies would be in the office in the afternoon for further interview.

9/29/69 1445 hours The three young ladies came into the office and were interviewed by Sgt. Lonergan, Sgt. Snook, and Capt. Donald Townsend.
Lonergan interviewed a MISS JOANNE MARIE, who, [age] years of age, DOB [blank], her address at the college is 114 Dauphine, Pacific Union College, home address South East 12th, College Place, Washington. MISS [JOANNE] advised R/O that on 9/27/69 at approximately 5:30 P.M. she and her two girlfriends parked their vehicle at a location two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. When they left their car they noticed a subject driving a late model silver blue Chevrolet, 2-door sedan, pull up behind them. What appeared to be a white male adult was sitting in the vehicle. They did not observe this subject leave the vehicle. The girls proceeded to the beach area and were sunbathing in their bikinis. After approximately one-half hour had passed, they observed what appeared to be the same subject standing within 40 or 50 feet of them, apparently observing them. This subject was described as 6' tall, weighing 200/210 lbs., muscular build, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing dark pants and a dark pullover shirt. The subject would stare at the three girls but when they looked up at him he would look away. The subject hung around the area for approximately 45 minutes and then the girls observed him walk up the hill. MISS [JOANNE] stated it was very doubtful that from his vantage point in the vehicle the subject could observe the three girls on the beach. She believes he waited in his vehicle and then followed them down after they were on the beach. MISS [JOANNE] further described the car as appearing very conservative. She stated the car did not appear to belong to any young person such as a teenager. She did state the car had California license plates but did not notice the number.
The other two young ladies, MISS [LINDA] and MISS [LINDA] were interviewed by Sgt. Snook and Capt. Donald Townsend.
MISS LINDA who was interviewed by R/O Det/Sgt. Snook, is a WFA, DOB [blank], home address Sunnyside Road, Sanitarium. She stated she left the Angwin area with two other girls, JOANNE and LINDA at approximately 2:45 P.M. 9/27/69. The girls drove through Pope Valley to Lake Berryessa where they parked their vehicle two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand. MISS [LINDA] stated she observed a subject go into the parking lot area to the south. Subject went past their vehicle and backed up so their rear bumpers were nearly touching. Vehicle described as a 1966 or 1967 light blue Chevrolet with California plates. Witness believes the vehicle was a 2-door sedan and described the headlights as being long rather than round. The rear window glass was tinted quite dark. Another vehicle from Angwin with Arizona plates was in the parking area and witness saw the occupants, a MISS DENISE BROWN and a MR. WAYNE HAIGHT.

to the beach and shortly thereafter noticed the male subject watching them from the edge of the trees. After about 30 minutes the subject came down by the beach and passed within 20 feet of witness as he walked from south to north. Subject was described by MISS [LINDA] as approximately 28 years of age, 6' to 6'2"" tall, 200/225 lbs., black hair possibly styled, with a part on left, rounded eyes, thin lips, medium nose, straight eyebrows, small ears, well built, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing a black short-sleeved sweater shirt, bunched up in front, and a white tee shirt hanging out in back, and dark trousers. The three girls left the area about 4:30 P.M. and the subject's vehicle was gone. Witnesses did not observe the subject either leave or get back into his vehicle.
MISS LINDA LEE was interviewed by R/O Capt. Donald Townsend. MISS [LINDA LEE] is a WFA, DOB [blank], address Howell Mountain Road, Angwin. MISS [LINDA LEE] is employed as a secretary of the college press. MISS [LINDA LEE] observed the same vehicle which was described as a late model Chevrolet, sky blue in color. The rear tail lights appeared to be long rather than round. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated they parked their vehicle at approximately 2:55 P.M. and observed the subject in his vehicle at that location. The girls proceeded to the beach and she, MISS [LINDA LEE], again noticed the subject about 30 to 45 minutes after they were at the beach. She noticed him standing on the bank approximately 45 yards from her location. She described the subject as 6 feet tall, stocky build, about 200 lbs., black short-sleeved sweater shirt, dark blue slacks, and straight dark hair neatly combed. She guessed his age at approximately 30 years. Subject had medium color skin and was not wearing glasses. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated she thought she saw a white belt around his back but it possibly was a tee shirt hanging out. She further stated that the man was fairly nice-looking, with a round face. She did not observe the subject leave the area in his vehicle.
9/29/69 - 1600 hours Reporting Officers Sgt. Narlow and Sgt. Lonergan were advised by Capt. Joseph Page that the female victim, MISS CECELIA SHEPARD, had just died at Queen of the Valley Hospital.

Page further advised R/Os that the remains would be removed to Morrison Funeral Home where DR. DE PETRIS would complete the autopsy.
At 1945 hours 9/29/69, R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were contacted by Probation Officer H. B. Schotte. Mr. Schotte had observed the footprint design that R/Os had taken at the scene and stated he had knowledge of a possible similar shoe sole design. Mr. Schotte brought into the office a MR.

Air Force Base and is a Flight Line Mechanic. He is a retired Master Sergeant in the United States Air Force. MR. [BASSEL] showed R/O a pair of Air Force chukker boots that belonged to him. He described these boots as being Government issue, issued to all Air Force personnel at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. They are primarily designed as a wing-walker shoe, however according to MR. [BASSEL] most Air Force personnel and many of the civilian personnel employed at Air Force bases had this type of shoe. The sole design of this shoe exactly matched the plaster cast design that Sgt. Snook had taken at the scene of the crime. It should be noted that Det/Sgt John Robertson had attempted to find a similar shoe design at the local shoe stores in the Napa area with negative results. (Refer Sgt. Robertson's supplementary report.) MR. [BASSEL] was asked if we could keep his shoes for identification purposes and he agreed. R/Os was also advised that this information regarding the type of footprint had not been released to the press or general public. MR. [BASSEL] stated he would cooperate with R/Os and keep this information confidential.
9/30/69, 0810 hours R/O Sgt. Lonergan received a telephone call from MISS MARILYN DENISE, 18 years of age, DOB [blank]. MISS [MARILYN] is a student at Pacific Union College and resides at Andre Hall, Room B-3. MISS [MARILYN] stated that about 5:15 P.M. Saturday, 9/27/69 she was in the Lake Berryessa area with a male companion, MR. JOHN, 22 years of age, also a student at Pacific Union College. She stated at this time they were parked on the Knoxville Road approximately one mile south of the Lake Berryessa Marina. She stated shortly after they parked the vehicle they observed the victims who were known to them, BRYAN HARTNELL and CECELIA SHEPARD, driving south on Knoxville Road in BRYAN's white Kharman Ghia. She stated as the HARTNELL vehicle drove by, BRYAN waved out the window and said, ""Hi, John!"", referring to MR. [JOHN]. MISS [MARILYN] stated that they did not see the HARTNELL vehicle any other time that day.
9/30/69, 0900 hours R/Os Det/Sgt. Narlow and Det/Sgt. Richard Lonergan, accompanied by Sgt. Thomas Butler, proceeded to the Morrison Funeral Home in St. Helena.

advised that the cause of death was shock and loss of blood brought on by two main stab wounds.
9/30/69, 1430 hours R/O Det/Sgt. Kenneth Narlow contacted CAPT. at Travis Air Force Base and arranged for an interview with COL. and SGT. to take place on Wednesday morning, October 1st, 1969, at 9:00 A.M. R/Os wanted to talk to someone at Travis regarding the shoeprints that were found on the scene. The remainder of the day and evening was spent in answering phone calls from people who had possible knowledge of the crime.
Wednesday, 10/1/69 - 0900 hours Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow went to Travis Air Force Base and were present at an interview in Col. office, who is Commanding Officer in charge of base security. Also present at this meeting besides the aforementioned officers was LT. COL. of the Office of Special Investigation. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan advised the Air Force personnel present of the portion of the evidence we had discovered at the crime scene and asked them for assistance in locating where this type of shoe was sold or issued. LT. COL. advised that his office would assist assigned investigators in attempting to locate the source of the shoe.
Officers were directed to the Base Supply with the assistance of Special Agent DONALD of O.S.I., at which time it was determined through Base Supply that this shoe in question was of Government issue and that it was not kept in stock at Base Supply, however it was believed that the Sales Store had such an item. It was then explained that if a military person or civilian employee was determined to be in need of such an item, he first reported to the Base Supply, at which time he was issued a purchase requisition which he in turn took to the Sales Store and the type of shoe was issued to the individual and they in turn required the individual to sign the purchase requisition showing that he did receive the item. This purchase requisition states the type of shoe that the individual was to receive, however makes no reference as to size.
Assigned investigators, accompanied by Special Agent proceeded to the Sales Store located on Travis Air Force Base. After a short period of time R/Os located in stock a shoe fitting the identical description of the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast which officers had in their possession. The identical shoe with identical tread was found and a shoe bearing the closest measurements in the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast was measured and found to be a size 10 1/2 in military styling or a 10 1/2 D in civilian equivalent. It was determined through Air Force records that they were unable to furnish officers with the

data regarding the sales of this type shoe due to the fact that no recordings were made of the specific sizes, however purchase records indicate over the past 13 months approximately 100 pairs of this size shoe, namely 10 1/2, had been purchased and disposed of through sales. Air Force records indicate this type shoe is manufactured by the International Shoe Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, then shipped to Air Force Depot, Ogden, Utah, and from there shipped to the various military installations upon requisition orders.
10/1/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then proceeded to the Vallejo Police Department and met with Sgt. Jack Mullanax and Sgt. Duane Nilsson. Officers exchanged information regarding Vallejo's crime of 7/4/69 and our particular incident. Suspect information was exchanged and is listed in the separate suspect file.
Investigating Officers checked to determine the validity of the decoded message and as to how far the original cyphers had been decoded. It was then learned that the message had been decoded by at least two different sources, one being by MR. and MRS. HARDIN of Salinas and the other by the FBI in Washington. It was noted that these cyphers were broken independent of one another and the FBI confirmed the validity of the original decoded message. It was also learned that there was a small portion on the very end of the coded message that had not been decoded for reasons unknown.
The balance of the afternoon and evening Reporting Officers and other investigating officers met to exchange information and further discuss the evidence at hand.
Thursday, October 2nd, 1969, 0845 hours Reporting Officer Lonergan received a telephone call from Special Agent, OSI, Travis Air Force Base. Subject called to report that approximately 500 to 1,000 of that type of wing-walker shoe have been sold as surplus on the Base. This would be over and above those sold at the Sales Store. Agent further related he has the names of all the subjects who have purchased this item through surplus and will keep these names available to officers upon request.
The balance of the morning was spent searching fingerprint evidence and answering phone calls from possible witnesses.
Thursday, 10/2/69, 1400 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan attended the funeral services for victim CECELIA SHEPARD. These services were held at the Pacific Union College Church, Angwin, California. Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan positioned themselves

inside the church in order to observe all persons who viewed the services and the remains of victim CECELIA SHEPARD. Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Sgt. Thomas Butler, and Detective Ronald Montgomery of the Napa Police Department positioned themselves outside the church and photographed all persons entering and leaving the services. This included individual photographs and group scenes. Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow also attended the graveside services at the St. Helena Cemetery in St. Helena.
Friday, 10/3/69 - Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Richard Lonergan contacted JAMES, Napa State Hospital, advised him to set up an interview with a patient who is a possible suspect in our case. The patient is identified as GRIFFIN RAYMOND FRANKLIN, WMA, 20 yrs. of age, DOB [blank], 6'2"", 223 lbs. [JAMES] had previously reported that this subject had left the hospital on a pass Friday evening, 9/26/69, and returned to the hospital Monday afternoon, 9/29/69. This subject also had spent time in the Air Force and was discharged from the Air Force in January 1969 for psychiatric problems. According to the doctors at the hospital, this subject was capable of committing this type of a crime. R/O in the presence of JAMES and Security Officer PHIL RYAN interviewed subject FRANKLIN. FRANKLIN was very cooperative and talkative to R/O and went over his activities the prior weekend. Briefly stated, MR. FRANKLIN, whose parents live in Vallejo, never left the Vallejo area that weekend and stayed around home talking with his mother, stepfather, and three brothers. After interviewing subject, it was the opinion of R/O Sgt. Lonergan that this subject was not the responsible. He had a definite very fast manner of speaking which was completely opposed to the victim's statement concerning the suspect's voice. R/O also contacted the mother of the suspect, a MRS. OPAL at Hollywood Avenue, Vallejo. MRS. OPAL stated more or less the exact same thing that her son had stated as to his whereabouts that weekend. It appears that this subject has a reliable alibi as to his activities and had no access to a vehicle that weekend. This subject was cleared as far as this crime is concerned.
The balance of the morning and afternoon was spent by R/Os Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan going over physical evidence and dictating reports.

9/28/69 12:30 P.M. Reporting Officer John Robertson, Det/Sgt., interviewed one of two victims who were each stabbed numerous times by an unknown assailant. Victim CECELIA SHEPARD and victim BRYAN HARTNELL both had been placed in the Queen of the Valley Hospital intensive care unit. Victim SHEPARD had surgery performed on her earlier in the morning (9/28/69) and was unable to be questioned by the Reporting Officer, however Dr. Ludwig gave permission for victim HARTNELL to be interviewed.
Although victim HARTNELL was heavily sedated, he was able to give R/O a verbal statement. (Note: R/O taped electrically the interview with victim HARTNELL.) Victim HARTNELL related the following.
He had known CECELIA SHEPARD for some time, they were good friends, and she had come to the Napa County area to spend the weekend. She and a female companion, DALORA LEE, Aspen, Loma Linda, San Bernardino County, Calif. (phone Ext. 2155) had driven from Southern California and were to drive back Sunday, 9/28/69. Victim stated he and MISS SHEPARD drove to Lake Berryessa, picked a large tree near the shore line where they decided to lie down and enjoy the scenery. While lying on the ground, victim HARTNELL stated he heard a noise and asked MISS SHEPARD if she could hear anything or see anything behind a tree not far from where the couple were lying. MISS SHEPARD told victim HARTNELL she could see a man behind the tree. HARTNELL asked her what he was doing. MISS SHEPARD stated she couldn't tell. HARTNELL stated he (suspect) then came from behind the tree. MISS SHEPARD said, ""Oh my God, he has a gun!""
Victim HARTNELL stated the man approached the couple, aiming a black steel automatic pistol. The suspect stated he needed a car and money. Suspect stated his car was ""hot"" and he wanted victim HARTNELL's car keys. Victim HARTNELL stated he began talking with the suspect, telling the suspect he had no money, only a small amount of change, also that if the suspect was really in need of assistance HARTNELL would attempt to help him. The suspect told victim to get on the ground. Suspect then had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him. HARTNELL stated he attempted to keep the suspect engaged in conversation while suspect was tying the victims.
HARTNELL further stated the suspect was described as follows: Wearing a black hooded mask (cloth), covering suspect's entire head and shoulders, coming down almost to suspect's waist. Victim stated on front of the four-cornered type mask (similar to paper bag in style) there was a symbol, the symbol described as white, approximately 3 x 3 inches in diameter, with a symmetrical cross. Also on the eyelets of the mask was a pair of clip-on sunglasses, the glasses clipped to the eyelets. Victim stated he could also see hair through the mask's eyelets and observed the hair to be dark brown.
Victim stated suspect was wearing a light-weight windbreaker, dark blue or black, pleated slacks (old-fashioned type). Victim could not remember what type of shoes or anything about suspect's hands, could not remember if suspect was wearing gloves.
Victim thought suspect was possibly 20 to 30 years of age by voice concept. Victim stated suspect was 5'8"" to 6', 225-250 lbs., dark brown hair, eyes unknown, sloppy dresser, stomach hanging over trousers. Suspect spoke with some

type of drawl, but victim stated it was not a Southern drawl, did not really know what type of drawl, but thought the man was not well educated, but did not feel he was illiterate either. Victim said suspect's voice was moderate in sound, that is, not high or low pitched.
Suspect told victim he was sent to (?) Lodge State Prison (possibly Deer Lodge State Prison), Montana, for a killing. While there (in prison) he killed a guard while escaping. Suspect also told victims he was heading for Mexico, told victim he was flat broke.
Victim observed cut-up rope in suspect's rear pocket (trouser's), also stated he was wearing a knife in a case (on belt) on his right side, near front of trousers. Knife description: Appeared to be a long bread knife, 12"" long blade, 3/4"" wide, hardwood handle, 2 brass rivets holding handle in place, cotton surgical tape wrapped approximately 1"" around handle of knife. Knife case possibly made of wood.
Victim asked suspect if suspect's gun was loaded. Suspect removed magazine from handle of pistol and showed victim a bullet removed from gun, bullet described as a possible .45 caliber. Victim did not know what caliber the pistol was.
Suspect had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him, suspect then tied victim SHEPARD's hands, then re-tied HARTNELL's hands, then tied both victims' ankles together, had victims lie on their stomachs. HARTNELL stated suspect said, ""I'm getting nervous."" This was when suspect was tying MISS SHEPARD'S hands, in fact HARTNELL stated suspect got real shaky when he was tying MISS SHEPARD's hands.
Victim HARTNELL then stated that without warning the suspect plunged his knife into the back of HARTNELL. Suspect did this repeatedly, HARTNELL stated he thinks six times. HARTNELL stated he pretended to be dead and the suspect went over to MISS SHEPARD and stabbed MISS SHEPARD repeatedly in the back, and when MISS SHEPARD turned her body over (on back), suspect stabbed her in the lower abdomen. Victim stated suspect stabbed MISS SHEPARD much worse than him. Suspect went into some sort of frenzy when stabbing MISS SHEPARD.
Victim HARTNELL stated suspect left the area after the stabbing. Victim HARTNELL hailed a boat (off shore) and told the man in the boat the couple needed help badly. Victim stated the boat left the area and he (victim) attempted to get help by crawling and walking to the road. (Victim believed he had walked to the road, however had not gone too far from his wounded companion.)
Victim stated he thought suspect had been with the couple for approximately fifteen (15) minutes from time of observing suspect until suspect departed. Victim stated suspect did not take his wallet, although when MISS SHEPARD was tying victim HARTNELL's hands, she reached in his pocket and threw his wallet to suspect. Suspect did not take the wallet or victim's car keys.
Victim stated a man in a pickup truck found him on the road and called an ambulance. Victim stated he estimated one hour in time was involved between the time he and MISS SHEPARD were stabbed until help arrived.
MISS SHEPARD is listed in critical condition.

Sgt. ROBERTSON stated that Mr. HARTNELL was heavily sedated but was able to give a verbal statement pertaining to the attack at Lake Berrysessa. The interview was taped and reads as follows:
""INTERVIEW OF JOHN ROBERTSON, DET/SGT., NAPA COUNTY SHERIFF's DEPARTMENT, WITH BRYAN CALVIN HARTNELL (NSO CASE #105907) AT QUEEN OF THE VALLEY HOSPITAL ON SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1969 (TRANSCRIBED FROM TAPE RECORDING BY M. FEURLE):
""J.R. Can you give me this fellow's description and tell me what happened?
""B.H. So many people have been asking me... I hope...
""J.R. Well sometimes when we're repetitious, I know it happens to me, I tell the same thing over and over and over, and sometimes I might vary a little, and if you do...
""B.H. Shall I just start out and tell you what happened?
""J.R. I don't want to tire you out.
""B.H. I just don't want this to happen again to anybody... Of course he might have his reasons, I don't know...
""J.R. Okay. Go right ahead. Start right from the beginning. What happened?
""B.H. Okay. This girl came out from school, I used to go with her two years ago, and she's now going to another school, and she came up to visit some friends and we were having dinner at the school cafeteria, and I said, 'Well, are you doing anything special this afternoon?' and she said, 'Why?', and I said, 'I don't know. We could go out and either go for a walk, go to San Francisco, or, you know, just...', 'cause we used to be good friends. We used to have a good friendship. And so it got too late by the time we got around to what we were going to do. We had to stop in St. Helena for a couple items and then we had to cart a couple kids home and stuff, and by the time we finally got around to it, it was getting late, and I thought going to San Francisco 'd rush you, you know, because by the time we got back for worship... And so we went out to Berryessa, and there was this one place I used to go out... we used to all the time, you know... and I couldn't find it. And so I figured Ah, forget it, and this looks like as good a place as any. So I parked the car, there were no other cars there. I had a Kharman Ghia, '56, white, with a black vinyl top, and it's in pretty

... ""good-looking shape. But we parked there on the road's edge and we talked Oh it must be about a quarter of a mile to down to the place where we went. We had... (unintelligible) peninsula, it's an an island I guess during the wetter season, You can see where it was levee... And so that looked like a lot... there was a big spreading tree up there. There were two of them, really, one was a little bigger than the other. We took the one that was out on the point.
""It was really beautiful out there. We were sitting on top... I lay down on my back and she lay down on her stomach beside me, you know, kind of resting her head on my shoulder, and we were talking, you know, kind of reminiscing about old times, and stuff. And I heard these rustling leaves, and I said, 'You have your specs on. Why don't you see what the deal is over there?' And she says, 'Oh, it's some man.' And I said, 'Is he alone?' and she said, 'Yeah... (unintelligible)...' and she says, 'Well he just stepped behind the tree.' And I said, 'What's the idea of that? To take a leak?' You know, 'cause that's the only thing I could think of, just step behind a tree. And so I says, 'Well, keep looking and tell me what happens,' and she says, 'Oh my God, he's got a gun!' and squeezed my arm and
""And so he came out, and of course still actually I wasn't... There's some things you really wouldn't mind having happen, just for the experience of it. You know I thought, Well I only got fifty cents on me. It's worth all of that having it happen. I didn't think about another angle. So I talked to him, you know. I said, 'Well listen, Mac, (you know I'm in the sociologist field, you know, I'm pre-law, with history and psych.) You know I've read about the criminal mind and everything, you know. I thought well maybe the guy really does need help, you know. I says, 'There's no strings attached.' I says, 'I don't have any money right now but if you need help that badly I can help you out in another way maybe.' And he says, 'Nah.. time's running short,' he says, ''cause I just got out of... some prison in Montana, I don't know what the name of it is. Feathers? Do you know what the name of it is? I'll see if it sounds familiar. Fern or Feathers? It's some double name, like Fern Lock or something...
""J.R. It's Lodge..

Case INV 1-15-311-F9-5861
""B.H. Oh yeah, yeah, Lodge. At least we know we're together on that.
""J.R. Mountain Lodge Prison, or something of that nature...
""B.H. Yeah. You know he said he broke out and had to kill a guard getting out. And I said, 'Well, man, I mean actually I don't mean to call your bluff or anything, but wouldn't you rather be stuck on a stealing charge than a threat of homicide?' you know? And he says, 'Well just don't start playing hero on me.' You know, 'Don't try to grab the gun,' 'cause I didn't really figure the gun was loaded. I always thought it would be empty. I've heard a lot of times that this is what they do just as a bluff, but I decided not to call his bluff after he really, you know... I told him, 'You know you're really wasting your time with me. I've got a billfold and this much change and that's it.' And he said, he told the girl, 'Go tie him up. I'd feel much better if you were tied up.' And she tied a couple of loose knots on me, so I made it look kind of tight... (unintelligible)... you know, just for a second, and he said 'Go ahead.' And I whispered to her, 'You know I think I can get that gun.' And I said, 'Do you mind?' and she got kind of fearful about it, so I figured since there's two lives involved, not just mine, I won't do it.
""So I let her tie me up on the wrists again, and he tied her up, - terribly tight, you know, real... (unintelligible) ... put his gun away, and we were talking and all, bantering, you know, basically. I was thinking, anything I can do to help, by the way just to keep the conversation going... Suddenly he was taking it all seriously, you know... So I was starting out and finally he said, 'Okay, lay down. I've got her tied up', you know... He strung a rope between our ankles in the rear, so we were like this, you know, on our stomachs, tied...
""J.R. You both facing the ground...
""B.H. Right. And, oh, this was before. I got sort of ahead. So anyway, he said, 'Get down,' and I said, 'Oh come on! We could freeze to death!' I said that a couple, three times, and he said, 'GET DOWN! RIGHT NOW!' He got a little pushed off at me. So I got down and then he finished tying her up and clonked her down, - and then he goes... Sswhooosh (a sound with his mouth)... (unintelligible)

""And so I said, 'Do you have bullets in there?' And so he pulled out the clip and showed me that he did. The bullets were about this long, I can remember, and about this fat, and they had the regular red cap on it, about this long. Maybe that doesn't give you any better description of the gun or not. I don't know. And it came out of the heel, the grip, you know. It slipped out from the bottom.
""And now, to backtrack a bit. I was really trying to see what he looked like, you know. He had on pleated pants, these old type of suit pants, you know, and they were either black or dark blue, I can't remember now. And I can't remember what he was wearing for shoes. But he had on this cotton coat, You've seen the kind, that you just turn the collar up once, there's a zipper down the front, you know. They're real light, super-thin, you know...
""J.R. Kind of a windbreaker...
""B.H. Yeah, like a windbreaker. And it's got this blue, this little collar, sometimes the guys wear them standing up, you know.
""J.R. What color was that?
""B.H. That was dark blue. And I don't know. Maybe he had something in his pouch. I just took it as being a... as being a... you know, he was stout 'cause he looked kind of heavy. I think he was weighing two and a quarter, two fifty, somewhere in there. And I got kind of a look at his hair. His voice... I can remember... almost like I'd heard it before. You know there's some drawls that a lot of people have similar. And... almost as if I'd heard it before... couldn't think where.
""I gave that one up, I just gave it up on that angle. I looked through his hair. I kind of looked like it was combed, you know, like this.. it was a brownish, you know, dark brown hair.
""And this mask he had on. It was ingeniously devised. It was... he had four corners at the top, like the top of a paper sack... black. It came down, came down, with the front panel about to here, and a kind of a thing that came over the shoulders, you know, and then the same thing down the back, straight down. And in the front he had a circle with a symmetrical cross in the middle. You know what I mean by a symmetrical cross?

Case INV 1-15-311-F9-5861
""J.R. Um hum (affirmative).
""B.H. The ends of the cross hung out about this far on each of the... you know, where it came out. The circle was this much... like this... and then it was like this, you see... hung out on the end, over the edge of the circle.
""And he had clip-on sunglasses... it was hard to tell. You know, the sunglasses you clip on when you're wearing glasses, eyeglasses, He had those clipped on. I'm pretty sure... I don't think he had glasses, though. I think he just had these clipped on to his suit... you know, that little mask.
""And I don't know how tall he was. Maybe 5-8 or maybe 5-10, 6 feet, somewhere in there. I'm a very poor judge of height because of my height. I have no meaning, you know. It's always down, you know. It can never be up...
""And so I saw him put away his gun, and I was turning to say something to Celia, and all of a sudden I felt my back... just... no, I think I saw him pull it out.. I don't remember... I think I saw him whip out his knife and just start stabbing me in the back... CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP! I was just (makes a gutteral sound)... you know that kind of a sound... and Celia turned to see why I was (repeats gutteral sound), you know, and she just about fainted. She went hysterical... (unintelligible) ... and when he finally stopped... I mean he went over and... The doctor says there's six in the back, six wounds on my back. You ought to confirm that. One I've got went clear through the lung. I've got it draining. I did drain a couple pints of blood out as soon as I got here. I lost an awful lot of blood, I guess.
""We were down... I mean it was absolutely no question in my mind... when a person gets stabbed as many times as we did... we were going to die. I mean there'd be no reason to question it. But somehow I, you know, started (unintelligible)... I just knew there was too much I had to live for. I mean really it does happen... about getting depressed and everything... when you're young you always think about these things... you know you think about it... and when you've got someone forcing your hand, oh well, there was a lot of things I had to do. And what really kept me going... you know my parents are pretty Christian. I haven't been too much of a Christian myself... but if you believe in the principle you ask God to help you. Another thing, What was my only strength was knowing two things. One, that I did not want to die, and two, that I felt that whatever was

""going to be was going to be, but I was going to try my damnedest to stay alive. And so, like I say, - before I left her I kissed her, and I said, 'Well,' I says, 'I'm gonna try to get help.'
""There was a boat kept circling around out there in the lake and we started yelling at it and finally it came within about 100 yards of the shore and turned off its motor and stayed there watching us for about fifteen minutes, and we were just screaming hysterically, trying to get their attention, you know, to come over here. Oh, I don't know, I guess they were afraid that the guy might be there in the bushes and they were liable to get choked or something. So finally he came up a little closer. I didn't have my glasses on... I was just swaying, you know... and I had gotten one of her hands free before they came, and so I kept trying to get her to untie me, and she couldn't, she was too weak, she said.
""So finally I just kept hollering and hollering, and she said, 'Turn around and let's see if I can do it again.' She finally got it. My hands and my feet were just pure numbness... they're still numb but I'm sure that will go 'way. But I finally got... (unintelligible)... untie her so she could kind of relax out. 'Cause it was a terrible position, you know, upon our stomachs... (unintelligible)...
""And so I started to go for help. I finally got myself fairly reconciled. I wasn't too worried about dying, if that was what was going to happen, but I knew I had to keep pushing on. I had to force myself into staying alive because it was... I could just see myself... you know, all sort of waves would come over... I just (coughing sound)... (unintelligible)... 'Well, you're not gonna give up this easy', you know. And, like I say, I just kept believing that God would do everything the best, if the thing was gonna happen, but I couldn't see any reason why my dying would be the best good. So I just played along with that.
""I just started to walk toward the road... everything blacked out on me... my visual... my mind was never blacked out, but my visual was. So I lay down... My eyes started to come open... I just saw a haze of trees, you know. In a little while I got up and went another twenty feet, and then the same thing happened... (unintelligible)... and sat down. Next thing I went clear... (unintelligible)... the road, and by that time I just fell... I just... I was trying so hard to go far I just went too far. Finally I heard this pickup

""coming... I was just laying alongside the road, and that's where this guy picked me up.
""They weren't in any hurry at all, it didn't seem like, you know, but they finally called an ambulance. About fifteen minutes later it came... (unintelligible)... but I still believe... I've got feeling... starting to get a little pain to come through. But from the minute that knife blade went in, it was nothing but pure shock from there on. I just did not expect it. I didn't expect that he would do that. That was a variable I had completely left out. And I guess he just took off running after we started running. I don't know. I never saw him before and hope not to see him again... at least outside of a courtroom.
""It's hard for me to explain much more. I mean I'm trying to give you a kind of example of his technique. He had some rope cut up in his back pocket. And he had a ... well, I thought it was a police automatic because it was in one of these black leather cases, you know...
""J.R. Was it in a smooth case, or did it have a basket weave like..
""B.H. Can I have my glasses? Oh, they're not here. It was a smooth one, though.
""J.R. Did he have this hood down to about the middle of his chest?
""B.H. No, about like... well, I'll show you... Here... his stomach.. You know I could see his... (voice fades away)
""J.R. Okay. You said his hair looked dark brown. How could you see his hair?
""B.H. 'Cause I saw it from where those goggles fit. I looked so closely to find out. And when he turned you know they kind of flittered... I could see his hair. It looked kind of greasy.
""J.R. Now was he as heavy as I am?
""B.H. Well I can't say 'cause he wasn't wearing those type of clothes. They were sloppy clothes, you know. And he just had on this old pair of pleated pants. I don't know... How tall are you?
""J.R. I'm about five eleven.

(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)
Case INV 1-15-311-F9-5861
""B.H. Well, like I say, he was dressed kind of sloppily, you know. His pants real tight up here and his stomach kind of pouched a bit, you know. I don't know... it's hard to say 'cause I can't judge you with being in a suit and all, you know, and him not being professional-looking at all. He could be about the same. It's hard to say. He was so sloppily dressed.
""J.R. Bryan, you also mentioned a drawl. Well not a drawl, an accent.
""B.H. It was just something... I guess his way of talking. It was something I couldn't repeat. It's like a song. Sometimes you know what you're going to say but you just can't sing the melody worth a darn.
""J.R. Did he have a throaty voice or a high pitched?
""B.H. In between. But it was just a unique way of talking.
""J.R. Did he sound like an educated man?
""B.H. Heck no! I don't think so.
""J.R. Did he sound illiterate?
""B.H. No. He didn't sound that way either. He just impressed me as being rather low class. The reason was because of his clothes, you know.
""J.R. Did you lose consciousness when he stabbed you at any time? Did you observe him stab Cecelia?
""B.H. Yeah...
""J.R. What did he say after...
""B.H. He stabbed her a bunch of times in the back. After she turned around, he got her once in the groin and one in the arm I think. He kind of went a little more hog-wild with her than with me. I faked dead... like that... I didn't want him to come back and give me some more.
""J.R. So you were pretty sure he thought you were dead when he finished working on you?

""B.H. I think he kind of thought that. Of course I don't know because we started talking right after he left. It's hard to say... (unintelligible)... I don't think she fainted either.
""J.R. Was she in a lot of pain, did she tell you?
""B.H. Oh yeah. She was more weak at the time... (unintelligible).. from the religious angle. I told her I sure as heck wasn't going to have any deathbed conversion. 'No,' she says... (unintelligible)... I mean it was just like you were gonna die and had a few things to say. But I felt more and more I wasn't losing strength as much... (unintelligible)... that I thought I could cope with...
""J.R. What you did was a courageous thing. It was a terrible thing to have happen to anyone.
""B.H. Well there was nothing we could do. We were kind of at the mercy of him. I mean I wanted to get that gun... (unintelligible)... There was a time I think I could have gotten it...
""J.R. Did it appear to be a .45 to you? An automatic?
""B.H. It was about this long... along the stock... and had a wood edge on it, you know.. on either side...
""J.R. Handles.
""B.H. Yeah...yeah...
""J.R. Did the bullet look anything like that?
""B.H. No. It was kind of like this, only it was gold, and this part here came out along with this and then round the gold, round the blunt end. Not quite that blunt-ended, though.
""J.R. Was it fat? Fatter than this?
""B.H. Yeah, I think it was a little fatter. But it was gold, you know. And I didn't see any of this here. There was a part where it crimped... Well, almost like that 22, short, only a lot bigger. It was about like this length, maybe more stubby.

""J.R. Well I'll get a .45 a little later and we can bring it up and let you observe it.
""B.H. ""Let's take the suspect. His hands... I don't remember if they had gloves on or not. I can't remember now. I keep thinking that he had gloves on. I can't figure how he tied us... Let's ask Celia, she probably knows about that.
""J.R. Did he swear? Did he use any profane language or obscenity?
""B.H. I don't think so. If he did it was no more than I was using at the time. I don't think he used any obscenity. He might have used a swear word or something, you know. That wasn't striking to me...
""J.R. Do you have any idea what his motive might have been? Money?
""B.H. Money. He said he was going to go to Mexico and he was flat broke.
""J.R. Did he search you after he...
""B.H. Heck no! Very unprofessional. He didn't even end up taking that loose change and didn't even take my billfold.
""J.R. Why did he stab you when you weren't fighting him off or anything?

CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his son would like to talk to them at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop regarding a possible suspect in this crime. 
At 0912 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan contacted DR. R. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his 16-yr. old son DAVID LEE RAYFIELD at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop. DR. RAYFIELD gave a home address of Los Gatos, California. DR. RAYFIELD stated that about 6:30 P.M. the previous evening he and his son had parked their car north of Park Headquarters in the general area of the crime scene. 
They stated they went down towards the beach area when DAVID RAYFIELD noticed a white male adult subject walking in the area, described as about 5'10"", heavy build, wearing dark trousers, a dark shirt with red in it, long sleeves. He stated this subject was carrying nothing in his hands and was apparently just walking alongside the hill area about halfway between the road and the lake. DAVID further stated that when the subject observed him he turned around and walked up the hill in a southerly direction. DR. RAYFIELD and his son stated that they did not notice a vehicle in the area of their vehicle and only this subject at a distance of about 100 yards. 
They also advised there was a man with two young boys in the area shooting B-B guns, but they did not know if this man saw the subject or not. This location was approximately 8/10ths of a mile from the scene of the victim's vehicle. In the opinion of R/Os, it is unlikely, unless this male subject had a vehicle in the immediate area, he could have traversed the area to the scene of the crime on foot. There are four coves of water between the scene of the crime and the area where the doctor saw the subject. The interview with DR. RAYFIELD and his son was terminated at that point.

MR. BYRD advised that MISS JUDY was a student at the college and had left the college earlier in the afternoon, driving a yellow Datsun. At 2135 hours Reporting Officers put out an All Points Bulletin around the City and County of Napa for this above described vehicle. At 2137 hours Officers received permission to interview the victim BRYAN HARTNELL who was taken to the X-Ray Room for x-rays. Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Lonergan attempted to interview BRYAN HARTNELL while in the presence of DONALD JUDAH and hospital attendant CLIFFORD MEAGHER. Sgt. Narlow was called away to answer a phone before the interview got under way. HARTNELL appeared to be in extreme pain and also appeared to be in shock. Reporting Officer Lonergan introduced himself to HARTNELL and asked him to give us any information he had on his assailant. HARTNELL stated that the assailant was wearing a black ceremonial type hood, square on top, and appeared to be heavy-set, between 200 and 250 pounds. He also stated his assailant had approached both him and MISS SHEPARD with a gun but had stabbed them with a long knife. HARTNELL further stated the gun was in a black holster and the knife was in a sheath. He stated that the attacker was wearing dark clothing, dark jacket and dark pants. HARTNELL further stated that the gun was an automatic pistol and the knife had a black handle and appeared to be homemade.
It should be noted that HARTNELL was very groggy and he was very difficult to interview at that time. Subject was re-interviewed the next day by Det/Sgt. Robertson and gave more complete details. (The report of Sgt. Robertson's interview is attached.)
At 2215 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan left the Queen of the Valley Hospital after advising Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and William Munk to take charge of the clothing of the victims and any other evidence from the victims when it was released from the hospital. Munk and Brambrink were also advised to stand by at the hospital as a security measure until other arrangements could be made.
As Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan were arriving at the Napa County Sheriff's Office, they were advised by the Napa Police Department that they had located MISS JUDY in the downtown Napa area and were bringing her to the Napa County Sheriff's Office. MISS [JUDY] was interviewed by Lonergan and Narlow at the Napa County Sheriff's Office. She was further identified as MISS JUDITH, a student at Pacific Union College, with a permanent residence address of Sun Valley, California. MISS [JUDITH] advised that she was with BRYAN

HARTNELL and CECELIA SHEPARD earlier in the afternoon. She stated that they all left Pacific Union College together at approximately 1:00 P.M. and went to a rummage sale in the City of St. Helena. She stated that BRYAN had bought a T.V. set at the rummage sale and had to transport it back to his room at Pacific Union College. She stated he left CECELIA at the rummage sale as there was not enough room in his car. MISS [JUDITH] stated BRYAN returned to the St. Helena area and picked up CECELIA at approximately 2:00 P.M. MISS [JUDITH] stated as far as she knew, both BRYAN and CECELIA were planning to go to San Francisco when they left her in St. Helena. MISS [JUDITH] stated she had no knowledge of any plans that BRYAN and CECELIA were making to go to the Lake Berryessa area. MISS [JUDITH] stated the last time she saw BRYAN and CECELIA was approximately 2:00 P.M. in the afternoon.
The interview with MISS [JUDITH] was terminated at that point.
Det/Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow then proceeded to Lake Berryessa and arrived at the scene of the crime, which was approximately a mile and a half north of Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters, at 2354 hours. The scene was being preserved by uniformed officers and under the direct control of Deputy Sheriffs David Collins and Ray Land. The investigating officers were briefed by Officers Collins and Land as to what had taken place prior to our arrival. Officers observed a 1956 white Kharman Ghia with a black vinyl top, Oregon license plate 4 U 2040. Investigating officers were shown footprints in dirt area and tire tracks, both believed to have been left by responsible. Investigating officers awaited the arrival of Sgt. Tom Butler who had been called to take photographs of the crime scene area and Sgt. Hal Snook, criminalist for collection and preservation of physical evidence. R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were advised by Park Ranger Dennis Land who had also arrived at the scene that it was possible to get to the beach area by vehicle from a locked gate approximately one-half mile south of the victim's vehicle. Officers proceeded to the area and arrived at the footpath approximately halfway between the scene of the crime at the beach and the victim's vehicle on the road. At that point, after a brief examination of the footpath area, officers discovered a similar footprint on the footpath to that found at the scene of the victim's vehicle. At that point, due to the lateness and darkness of the hour, Reporting Officers decided to completely secure the area and make a thorough search of the scene at first light. Officers then exited the crime scene area in the same manner and locked the aforementioned gate leading to this vicinity. Investigating officers along with Park Ranger Dennis Land went to the Berryessa Park Headquarters.

took into his possession certain items belonging to the victims that were taken into evidence by Ranger Dennis Land. These items consisted of a blanket, a pair of man's shoes, a wallet belonging to BRYAN HARTNELL, eyeglasses, and playing cards. Among the various aforementioned items believed to belong to the victims, were numerous strands of white plastic line cut into various assorted lengths, some of which had what appeared to be bloodstains. These items were subsequently turned over to Det/Sgt. Hal Snook for preservation.
Assigned investigators then proceeded back to the scene where the victim's car was parked and assisted Sgt. Snook in the making of the plaster casts. At approximately 0245 hours Sgt. Lonergan, having previously obtained the keys to the vehicle from BRYAN HARTNELL's property at Queen of the Valley Hospital, drove the white Kharman Ghia to the maintenance shop at Berryessa Park Headquarters. The vehicle was parked inside of the maintenance shop building and the building was secured for the evening by investigating officers with the assistance of Park Ranger Dennis Land. Assigned Investigators then returned back to the scene where the victim's vehicle had been previously parked and awaited the arrival of Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and Mel Fechter who were assigned to security duty in the crime scene area. At approximately 0300 hours officers assumed their duties at the crime scene area and the security was placed under the direction of Deputy Allen Brambrink.

crime scene. They stated they went down towards the beach area when DAVID RAYFIELD noticed a white male adult subject walking in the area, described as about 5'10"", heavy build, wearing dark trousers, a dark shirt with red in it, long sleeves. He stated this subject was carrying nothing in his hands and was apparently just walking alongside the hill area about halfway between the road and the lake.

At 1000 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene of the crime and further assisted Sgt. Snook in the collecting and locating of evidence.
At 1320 hours 9/28/69, R/Os interviewed Ranger Sgt. William White at Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters. White was interviewed as to his activities before and during his part in locating the victims the night before. White stated at approximately 1855 hours 9/27/69 he was on routine patrol around the Lake Berryessa area when he received a call from Park Headquarters to proceed to the Rancho Monticello Resort where a person was reporting a possible stabbing. 
White stated he proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort where he was contacted by ARCHIE E. WHITE, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG. RONALD FONG advised him that he had seen a male and a female victim on the beach area south of Rancho Monticello Resort, hollering that they had been stabbed. Ranger Sgt. White, accompanied by ARCHIE WHITE, ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the beach area via speedboat owned by ARCHIE WHITE. When they arrived on the beach they observed a young female lying on the ground with what appeared to be numerous stab wounds. Ranger Sgt. White stated that the female appeared to be in a great deal of pain. White stated as they discovered the female victim, Ranger Dennis Land arrived at the scene in his pickup truck, carrying a male victim who also appeared to have numerous stab wounds. White stated he immediately radioed in and had Park Headquarters call the Sheriff's Office to dispatch an ambulance and a Deputy.

arrival of the ambulance. According to White, the male victim said that a male subject approached them, wearing a hood, dressed in dark clothing. The subject was carrying what appeared to be an automatic pistol and stated that he wanted their money and car keys. According to White, the male victim related to him that the subject advised him he was an ex-con out of Colorado and was en route to Mexico. Suspect stated he had to tie them up, and after they were tied the responsible stated, ""I'm going to have to stab you."" White further related that the male victim advised the responsible, ""Stab me first, I can't stand to see her stabbed first."" The male victim then advised that the responsible stabbed him numerous times in the back and then stabbed the girl.
The female victim advised White that she could not see the responsible's face as a hood was covering all of his head. She also advised White that the suspect had what appeared to be clip-on sunglasses to cover his eyes. Ranger Sgt. White stated that this is the most he could get out of either victim as they were both in great shock and pain. White stated that he noticed a lot of blood near the girl's groin area. The interview with Ranger Sgt. White was terminated at that point.
9/28/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort and interviewed MR. ARCHIE E. WHITE. (It should be noted that ARCHIE E. WHITE and ELIZABETH WHITE are no relation to Ranger Sgt. White.) ARCHIE E. WHITE is the owner of the Boat Repair Shop at Rancho Monticello Resort. He lives at the Resort. Also interviewed were MR. WHITE's wife, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE. MR. and MRS. WHITE advised that they were contacted by RONALD FONG who advised them he had just observed what appeared to be a male and a female subject lying on the beach south of the Rancho Monticello Resort, covered with blood. FONG advised them that the couple had shouted out to him that they had been stabbed and robbed. MRS. WHITE immediately called Park Headquarters and Ranger Sgt. William White arrived at the Resort a short time later. MR. and MRS. WHITE, accompanied by Ranger Sgt. Bill White and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the scene area in one of MR. WHITE's ski boats. When they arrived on the scene, they observed a young female wearing a sweater dress lying on the beach, covered with blood. When they approached the area she was on her elbows and knees, rocking back and forth as if in great pain. MRS. WHITE stated she immediately attempted to make the victim more comfortable and tried to calm her down until the ambulance arrived. MRS. WHITE stated the girl advised him, ""He was a man with a hood... His face was covered... He was wearing black pants... It hurts, it

hurts."" MRS. WHITE then advised after the female had regained her composure, she told her the man had asked for money but didn't take any. She said she hadn't been raped. MRS. WHITE further advised that the female victim told her that the responsible was wearing glasses, with dark clip-on sunglasses over the hood. She told her that the responsible had a black pistol. MR. ARCHIE WHITE stated he overheard the male victim advise someone that the responsible was wearing gloves. MR. and MRS. WHITE further advised that this is the only information either victim gave them on the responsible, and that they spent the balance of the time attempting to make the victim more comfortable until the arrival of the ambulance.
After the interview with MR. and MRS. WHITE, Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan returned to the Napa County Sheriff's Office.
At 1620 hours R/O Det/Sgt. Narlow was contacted by a DEAN of the Pacific Union College in Angwin. DEAN advised that three young ladies, students at the college, might possibly have information as to a suspect in the attack at Lake Berryessa. The young ladies were identified as MISS JOANNE, MISS LINDA, and MISS LINDA. DEAN advised that these girls had been in the Lake Berryessa area from about 3:00 P.M. to 4:30 P.M. the previous Saturday afternoon. They had observed a male subject in a late model, silver blue Chevrolet, two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. DEAN advised that the girls had told him they were observed out of the car by this subject while they were sunbathing on the beach. They described the subject as approximately 40 years old, [blank] feet tall, dressed in dark clothing. Sgt. Narlow dispatched Deputy Sheriff Raymond Land to interview these three girls that evening.

9/29/69 1445 hours The three young ladies came into the office and were interviewed by Sgt. Lonergan, Sgt. Snook, and Capt. Donald Townsend.
Lonergan interviewed a MISS JOANNE MARIE, who, [age] years of age, DOB [blank], her address at the college is 114 Dauphine, Pacific Union College, home address South East 12th, College Place, Washington. MISS [JOANNE] advised R/O that on 9/27/69 at approximately 5:30 P.M. she and her two girlfriends parked their vehicle at a location two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. When they left their car they noticed a subject driving a late model silver blue Chevrolet, 2-door sedan, pull up behind them. What appeared to be a white male adult was sitting in the vehicle. They did not observe this subject leave the vehicle. The girls proceeded to the beach area and were sunbathing in their bikinis. After approximately one-half hour had passed, they observed what appeared to be the same subject standing within 40 or 50 feet of them, apparently observing them. This subject was described as 6' tall, weighing 200/210 lbs., muscular build, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing dark pants and a dark pullover shirt. The subject would stare at the three girls but when they looked up at him he would look away. The subject hung around the area for approximately 45 minutes and then the girls observed him walk up the hill. MISS [JOANNE] stated it was very doubtful that from his vantage point in the vehicle the subject could observe the three girls on the beach. She believes he waited in his vehicle and then followed them down after they were on the beach. MISS [JOANNE] further described the car as appearing very conservative. She stated the car did not appear to belong to any young person such as a teenager. She did state the car had California license plates but did not notice the number.
The other two young ladies, MISS [LINDA] and MISS [LINDA] were interviewed by Sgt. Snook and Capt. Donald Townsend.
MISS LINDA who was interviewed by R/O Det/Sgt. Snook, is a WFA, DOB [blank], home address Sunnyside Road, Sanitarium. She stated she left the Angwin area with two other girls, JOANNE and LINDA at approximately 2:45 P.M. 9/27/69. The girls drove through Pope Valley to Lake Berryessa where they parked their vehicle two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand. MISS [LINDA] stated she observed a subject go into the parking lot area to the south. Subject went past their vehicle and backed up so their rear bumpers were nearly touching. Vehicle described as a 1966 or 1967 light blue Chevrolet with California plates. Witness believes the vehicle was a 2-door sedan and described the headlights as being long rather than round. The rear window glass was tinted quite dark. Another vehicle from Angwin with Arizona plates was in the parking area and witness saw the occupants, a MISS DENISE BROWN and a MR. WAYNE HAIGHT.

to the beach and shortly thereafter noticed the male subject watching them from the edge of the trees. After about 30 minutes the subject came down by the beach and passed within 20 feet of witness as he walked from south to north. Subject was described by MISS [LINDA] as approximately 28 years of age, 6' to 6'2"" tall, 200/225 lbs., black hair possibly styled, with a part on left, rounded eyes, thin lips, medium nose, straight eyebrows, small ears, well built, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing a black short-sleeved sweater shirt, bunched up in front, and a white tee shirt hanging out in back, and dark trousers. The three girls left the area about 4:30 P.M. and the subject's vehicle was gone. Witnesses did not observe the subject either leave or get back into his vehicle.
MISS LINDA LEE was interviewed by R/O Capt. Donald Townsend. MISS [LINDA LEE] is a WFA, DOB [blank], address Howell Mountain Road, Angwin. MISS [LINDA LEE] is employed as a secretary of the college press. MISS [LINDA LEE] observed the same vehicle which was described as a late model Chevrolet, sky blue in color. The rear tail lights appeared to be long rather than round. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated they parked their vehicle at approximately 2:55 P.M. and observed the subject in his vehicle at that location. The girls proceeded to the beach and she, MISS [LINDA LEE], again noticed the subject about 30 to 45 minutes after they were at the beach. She noticed him standing on the bank approximately 45 yards from her location. She described the subject as 6 feet tall, stocky build, about 200 lbs., black short-sleeved sweater shirt, dark blue slacks, and straight dark hair neatly combed. She guessed his age at approximately 30 years. Subject had medium color skin and was not wearing glasses. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated she thought she saw a white belt around his back but it possibly was a tee shirt hanging out. She further stated that the man was fairly nice-looking, with a round face. She did not observe the subject leave the area in his vehicle.
9/29/69 - 1600 hours Reporting Officers Sgt. Narlow and Sgt. Lonergan were advised by Capt. Joseph Page that the female victim, MISS CECELIA SHEPARD, had just died at Queen of the Valley Hospital. Capt. Page, who is Chief Napa County Coroner, stated he would handle the case and contact DR. DE PETRIS who would perform the autopsy the next morning. Capt. Page further advised R/Os that the remains would be removed to Morrison Funeral Home where DR. DE PETRIS would complete the autopsy.
At 1945 hours 9/29/69, R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were contacted by Probation Officer H. B. Schotte. Mr. Schotte had observed the footprint design that R/Os had taken at the scene and stated he had knowledge of a possible similar shoe sole design. Mr. Schotte brought into the office a MR.

Air Force Base and is a Flight Line Mechanic. He is a retired Master Sergeant in the United States Air Force. MR. [BASSEL] showed R/O a pair of Air Force chukker boots that belonged to him. He described these boots as being Government issue, issued to all Air Force personnel at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. They are primarily designed as a wing-walker shoe, however according to MR. [BASSEL] most Air Force personnel and many of the civilian personnel employed at Air Force bases had this type of shoe. The sole design of this shoe exactly matched the plaster cast design that Sgt. Snook had taken at the scene of the crime. It should be noted that Det/Sgt John Robertson had attempted to find a similar shoe design at the local shoe stores in the Napa area with negative results. (Refer Sgt. Robertson's supplementary report.) MR. [BASSEL] was asked if we could keep his shoes for identification purposes and he agreed. R/Os was also advised that this information regarding the type of footprint had not been released to the press or general public. MR. [BASSEL] stated he would cooperate with R/Os and keep this information confidential.
9/30/69, 0810 hours R/O Sgt. Lonergan received a telephone call from MISS MARILYN DENISE, 18 years of age, DOB [blank]. MISS [MARILYN] is a student at Pacific Union College and resides at Andre Hall, Room B-3. MISS [MARILYN] stated that about 5:15 P.M. Saturday, 9/27/69 she was in the Lake Berryessa area with a male companion, MR. JOHN, 22 years of age, also a student at Pacific Union College. She stated at this time they were parked on the Knoxville Road approximately one mile south of the Lake Berryessa Marina. She stated shortly after they parked the vehicle they observed the victims who were known to them, BRYAN HARTNELL and CECELIA SHEPARD, driving south on Knoxville Road in BRYAN's white Kharman Ghia. She stated as the HARTNELL vehicle drove by, BRYAN waved out the window and said, ""Hi, John!"", referring to MR. [JOHN]. MISS [MARILYN] stated that they did not see the HARTNELL vehicle any other time that day.
9/30/69, 0900 hours R/Os Det/Sgt. Narlow and Det/Sgt. Richard Lonergan, accompanied by Sgt. Thomas Butler, proceeded to the Morrison Funeral Home in St. Helena. They were met at the funeral home by Capt. Joseph Page and the owner of the Funeral Home, Mr. Harold. Shortly after the R/Os arrived, they were met by the pathology surgeons, DR. WILMER A. DE PETRIS and DR. DWIGHT G. STRAUB. DR. DE PETRIS offices are at 373 Perkins Street, Sonoma.

advised that the cause of death was shock and loss of blood brought on by two main stab wounds.
9/30/69, 1430 hours R/O Det/Sgt. Kenneth Narlow contacted CAPT. at Travis Air Force Base and arranged for an interview with COL. and SGT. to take place on Wednesday morning, October 1st, 1969, at 9:00 A.M. R/Os wanted to talk to someone at Travis regarding the shoeprints that were found on the scene. The remainder of the day and evening was spent in answering phone calls from people who had possible knowledge of the crime.
Wednesday, 10/1/69 - 0900 hours Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow went to Travis Air Force Base and were present at an interview in Col. office, who is Commanding Officer in charge of base security. Also present at this meeting besides the aforementioned officers was LT. COL. of the Office of Special Investigation. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan advised the Air Force personnel present of the portion of the evidence we had discovered at the crime scene and asked them for assistance in locating where this type of shoe was sold or issued. LT. COL. advised that his office would assist assigned investigators in attempting to locate the source of the shoe.
Officers were directed to the Base Supply with the assistance of Special Agent DONALD of O.S.I., at which time it was determined through Base Supply that this shoe in question was of Government issue and that it was not kept in stock at Base Supply, however it was believed that the Sales Store had such an item. It was then explained that if a military person or civilian employee was determined to be in need of such an item, he first reported to the Base Supply, at which time he was issued a purchase requisition which he in turn took to the Sales Store and the type of shoe was issued to the individual and they in turn required the individual to sign the purchase requisition showing that he did receive the item. This purchase requisition states the type of shoe that the individual was to receive, however makes no reference as to size.
Assigned investigators, accompanied by Special Agent proceeded to the Sales Store located on Travis Air Force Base. After a short period of time R/Os located in stock a shoe fitting the identical description of the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast which officers had in their possession. The identical shoe with identical tread was found and a shoe bearing the closest measurements in the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast was measured and found to be a size 10 1/2 in military styling or a 10 1/2 D in civilian equivalent. It was determined through Air Force records that they were unable to furnish officers with the

data regarding the sales of this type shoe due to the fact that no recordings were made of the specific sizes, however purchase records indicate over the past 13 months approximately 100 pairs of this size shoe, namely 10 1/2, had been purchased and disposed of through sales. Air Force records indicate this type shoe is manufactured by the International Shoe Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, then shipped to Air Force Depot, Ogden, Utah, and from there shipped to the various military installations upon requisition orders.
10/1/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then proceeded to the Vallejo Police Department and met with Sgt. Jack Mullanax and Sgt. Duane Nilsson. Officers exchanged information regarding Vallejo's crime of 7/4/69 and our particular incident. Suspect information was exchanged and is listed in the separate suspect file.
Investigating Officers checked to determine the validity of the decoded message and as to how far the original cyphers had been decoded. It was then learned that the message had been decoded by at least two different sources, one being by MR. and MRS. HARDIN of Salinas and the other by the FBI in Washington. It was noted that these cyphers were broken independent of one another and the FBI confirmed the validity of the original decoded message. It was also learned that there was a small portion on the very end of the coded message that had not been decoded for reasons unknown.
The balance of the afternoon and evening Reporting Officers and other investigating officers met to exchange information and further discuss the evidence at hand.
Thursday, October 2nd, 1969, 0845 hours Reporting Officer Lonergan received a telephone call from Special Agent, OSI, Travis Air Force Base. Subject called to report that approximately 500 to 1,000 of that type of wing-walker shoe have been sold as surplus on the Base. This would be over and above those sold at the Sales Store. Agent further related he has the names of all the subjects who have purchased this item through surplus and will keep these names available to officers upon request.
The balance of the morning was spent searching fingerprint evidence and answering phone calls from possible witnesses.
Thursday, 10/2/69, 1400 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan attended the funeral services for victim CECELIA SHEPARD. These services were held at the Pacific Union College Church, Angwin, California. Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan positioned themselves

inside the church in order to observe all persons who viewed the services and the remains of victim CECELIA SHEPARD. Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Sgt. Thomas Butler, and Detective Ronald Montgomery of the Napa Police Department positioned themselves outside the church and photographed all persons entering and leaving the services. This included individual photographs and group scenes. Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow also attended the graveside services at the St. Helena Cemetery in St. Helena.
Friday, 10/3/69 - Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Richard Lonergan contacted JAMES, Napa State Hospital, advised him to set up an interview with a patient who is a possible suspect in our case. The patient is identified as GRIFFIN RAYMOND FRANKLIN, WMA, 20 yrs. of age, DOB [blank], 6'2"", 223 lbs. [JAMES] had previously reported that this subject had left the hospital on a pass Friday evening, 9/26/69, and returned to the hospital Monday afternoon, 9/29/69. This subject also had spent time in the Air Force and was discharged from the Air Force in January 1969 for psychiatric problems. According to the doctors at the hospital, this subject was capable of committing this type of a crime. R/O in the presence of JAMES and Security Officer PHIL RYAN interviewed subject FRANKLIN. FRANKLIN was very cooperative and talkative to R/O and went over his activities the prior weekend. Briefly stated, MR. FRANKLIN, whose parents live in Vallejo, never left the Vallejo area that weekend and stayed around home talking with his mother, stepfather, and three brothers. After interviewing subject, it was the opinion of R/O Sgt. Lonergan that this subject was not the responsible. He had a definite very fast manner of speaking which was completely opposed to the victim's statement concerning the suspect's voice. R/O also contacted the mother of the suspect, a MRS. OPAL at Hollywood Avenue, Vallejo. MRS. OPAL stated more or less the exact same thing that her son had stated as to his whereabouts that weekend. It appears that this subject has a reliable alibi as to his activities and had no access to a vehicle that weekend. This subject was cleared as far as this crime is concerned.
The balance of the morning and afternoon was spent by R/Os Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan going over physical evidence and dictating reports.

9/28/69 12:30 P.M. Reporting Officer John Robertson, Det/Sgt., interviewed one of two victims who were each stabbed numerous times by an unknown assailant. Victim CECELIA SHEPARD and victim BRYAN HARTNELL both had been placed in the Queen of the Valley Hospital intensive care unit. Victim SHEPARD had surgery performed on her earlier in the morning (9/28/69) and was unable to be questioned by the Reporting Officer, however Dr. Ludwig gave permission for victim HARTNELL to be interviewed.
Although victim HARTNELL was heavily sedated, he was able to give R/O a verbal statement. (Note: R/O taped electrically the interview with victim HARTNELL.) Victim HARTNELL related the following.
He had known CECELIA SHEPARD for some time, they were good friends, and she had come to the Napa County area to spend the weekend. She and a female companion, DALORA LEE, Aspen, Loma Linda, San Bernardino County, Calif. (phone Ext. 2155) had driven from Southern California and were to drive back Sunday, 9/28/69. Victim stated he and MISS SHEPARD drove to Lake Berryessa, picked a large tree near the shore line where they decided to lie down and enjoy the scenery. While lying on the ground, victim HARTNELL stated he heard a noise and asked MISS SHEPARD if she could hear anything or see anything behind a tree not far from where the couple were lying. MISS SHEPARD told victim HARTNELL she could see a man behind the tree. HARTNELL asked her what he was doing. MISS SHEPARD stated she couldn't tell. HARTNELL stated he (suspect) then came from behind the tree. MISS SHEPARD said, ""Oh my God, he has a gun!""
Victim HARTNELL stated the man approached the couple, aiming a black steel automatic pistol. The suspect stated he needed a car and money. Suspect stated his car was ""hot"" and he wanted victim HARTNELL's car keys. Victim HARTNELL stated he began talking with the suspect, telling the suspect he had no money, only a small amount of change, also that if the suspect was really in need of assistance HARTNELL would attempt to help him. The suspect told victim to get on the ground. Suspect then had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him. HARTNELL stated he attempted to keep the suspect engaged in conversation while suspect was tying the victims.
HARTNELL further stated the suspect was described as follows: Wearing a black hooded mask (cloth), covering suspect's entire head and shoulders, coming down almost to suspect's waist. Victim stated on front of the four-cornered type mask (similar to paper bag in style) there was a symbol, the symbol described as white, approximately 3 x 3 inches in diameter, with a symmetrical cross. Also on the eyelets of the mask was a pair of clip-on sunglasses, the glasses clipped to the eyelets. Victim stated he could also see hair through the mask's eyelets and observed the hair to be dark brown.
Victim stated suspect was wearing a light-weight windbreaker, dark blue or black, pleated slacks (old-fashioned type). Victim could not remember what type of shoes or anything about suspect's hands, could not remember if suspect was wearing gloves.
Victim thought suspect was possibly 20 to 30 years of age by voice concept. Victim stated suspect was 5'8"" to 6', 225-250 lbs., dark brown hair, eyes unknown, sloppy dresser, stomach hanging over trousers. Suspect spoke with some

type of drawl, but victim stated it was not a Southern drawl, did not really know what type of drawl, but thought the man was not well educated, but did not feel he was illiterate either. Victim said suspect's voice was moderate in sound, that is, not high or low pitched.
Suspect told victim he was sent to (?) Lodge State Prison (possibly Deer Lodge State Prison), Montana, for a killing. While there (in prison) he killed a guard while escaping. Suspect also told victims he was heading for Mexico, told victim he was flat broke.
Victim observed cut-up rope in suspect's rear pocket (trouser's), also stated he was wearing a knife in a case (on belt) on his right side, near front of trousers. Knife description: Appeared to be a long bread knife, 12"" long blade, 3/4"" wide, hardwood handle, 2 brass rivets holding handle in place, cotton surgical tape wrapped approximately 1"" around handle of knife. Knife case possibly made of wood.
Victim asked suspect if suspect's gun was loaded. Suspect removed magazine from handle of pistol and showed victim a bullet removed from gun, bullet described as a possible .45 caliber. Victim did not know what caliber the pistol was.
Suspect had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him, suspect then tied victim SHEPARD's hands, then re-tied HARTNELL's hands, then tied both victims' ankles together, had victims lie on their stomachs. HARTNELL stated suspect said, ""I'm getting nervous."" This was when suspect was tying MISS SHEPARD'S hands, in fact HARTNELL stated suspect got real shaky when he was tying MISS SHEPARD's hands.
Victim HARTNELL then stated that without warning the suspect plunged his knife into the back of HARTNELL. Suspect did this repeatedly, HARTNELL stated he thinks six times. HARTNELL stated he pretended to be dead and the suspect went over to MISS SHEPARD and stabbed MISS SHEPARD repeatedly in the back, and when MISS SHEPARD turned her body over (on back), suspect stabbed her in the lower abdomen. Victim stated suspect stabbed MISS SHEPARD much worse than him. Suspect went into some sort of frenzy when stabbing MISS SHEPARD.
Victim HARTNELL stated suspect left the area after the stabbing. Victim HARTNELL hailed a boat (off shore) and told the man in the boat the couple needed help badly. Victim stated the boat left the area and he (victim) attempted to get help by crawling and walking to the road. (Victim believed he had walked to the road, however had not gone too far from his wounded companion.)
Victim stated he thought suspect had been with the couple for approximately fifteen (15) minutes from time of observing suspect until suspect departed. Victim stated suspect did not take his wallet, although when MISS SHEPARD was tying victim HARTNELL's hands, she reached in his pocket and threw his wallet to suspect. Suspect did not take the wallet or victim's car keys.
Victim stated a man in a pickup truck found him on the road and called an ambulance. Victim stated he estimated one hour in time was involved between the time he and MISS SHEPARD were stabbed until help arrived.
MISS SHEPARD is listed in critical condition.

Sgt. ROBERTSON stated that Mr. HARTNELL was heavily sedated but was able to give a verbal statement pertaining to the attack at Lake Berrysessa. The interview was taped and reads as follows:
""INTERVIEW OF JOHN ROBERTSON, DET/SGT., NAPA COUNTY SHERIFF's DEPARTMENT, WITH BRYAN CALVIN HARTNELL (NSO CASE #105907) AT QUEEN OF THE VALLEY HOSPITAL ON SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1969 (TRANSCRIBED FROM TAPE RECORDING BY M. FEURLE):
""J.R. Can you give me this fellow's description and tell me what happened?
""B.H. So many people have been asking me... I hope...
""J.R. Well sometimes when we're repetitious, I know it happens to me, I tell the same thing over and over and over, and sometimes I might vary a little, and if you do...
""B.H. Shall I just start out and tell you what happened?
""J.R. I don't want to tire you out.
""B.H. I just don't want this to happen again to anybody... Of course he might have his reasons, I don't know...
""J.R. Okay. Go right ahead. Start right from the beginning. What happened?
""B.H. Okay. This girl came out from school, I used to go with her two years ago, and she's now going to another school, and she came up to visit some friends and we were having dinner at the school cafeteria, and I said, 'Well, are you doing anything special this afternoon?' and she said, 'Why?', and I said, 'I don't know. We could go out and either go for a walk, go to San Francisco, or, you know, just...', 'cause we used to be good friends. We used to have a good friendship. And so it got too late by the time we got around to what we were going to do. We had to stop in St. Helena for a couple items and then we had to cart a couple kids home and stuff, and by the time we finally got around to it, it was getting late, and I thought going to San Francisco 'd rush you, you know, because by the time we got back for worship... And so we went out to Berryessa, and there was this one place I used to go out... we used to all the time, you know... and I couldn't find it. And so I figured Ah, forget it, and this looks like as good a place as any. So I parked the car, there were no other cars there. I had a Kharman Ghia, '56, white, with a black vinyl top, and it's in pretty

... ""good-looking shape. But we parked there on the road's edge and we talked Oh it must be about a quarter of a mile to down to the place where we went. We had... (unintelligible) peninsula, it's an an island I guess during the wetter season, You can see where it was levee... And so that looked like a lot... there was a big spreading tree up there. There were two of them, really, one was a little bigger than the other. We took the one that was out on the point.
""It was really beautiful out there. We were sitting on top... I lay down on my back and she lay down on her stomach beside me, you know, kind of resting her head on my shoulder, and we were talking, you know, kind of reminiscing about old times, and stuff. And I heard these rustling leaves, and I said, 'You have your specs on. Why don't you see what the deal is over there?' And she says, 'Oh, it's some man.' And I said, 'Is he alone?' and she said, 'Yeah... (unintelligible)...' and she says, 'Well he just stepped behind the tree.' And I said, 'What's the idea of that? To take a leak?' You know, 'cause that's the only thing I could think of, just step behind a tree. And so I says, 'Well, keep looking and tell me what happens,' and she says, 'Oh my God, he's got a gun!' and squeezed my arm and
""And so he came out, and of course still actually I wasn't... There's some things you really wouldn't mind having happen, just for the experience of it. You know I thought, Well I only got fifty cents on me. It's worth all of that having it happen. I didn't think about another angle. So I talked to him, you know. I said, 'Well listen, Mac, (you know I'm in the sociologist field, you know, I'm pre-law, with history and psych.) You know I've read about the criminal mind and everything, you know. I thought well maybe the guy really does need help, you know. I says, 'There's no strings attached.' I says, 'I don't have any money right now but if you need help that badly I can help you out in another way maybe.' And he says, 'Nah.. time's running short,' he says, ''cause I just got out of... some prison in Montana, I don't know what the name of it is. Feathers? Do you know what the name of it is? I'll see if it sounds familiar. Fern or Feathers? It's some double name, like Fern Lock or something...
""J.R. It's Lodge..

""B.H. Oh yeah, yeah, Lodge. At least we know we're together on that.
""J.R. Mountain Lodge Prison, or something of that nature...
""B.H. Yeah. You know he said he broke out and had to kill a guard getting out. And I said, 'Well, man, I mean actually I don't mean to call your bluff or anything, but wouldn't you rather be stuck on a stealing charge than a threat of homicide?' you know? And he says, 'Well just don't start playing hero on me.' You know, 'Don't try to grab the gun,' 'cause I didn't really figure the gun was loaded. I always thought it would be empty. I've heard a lot of times that this is what they do just as a bluff, but I decided not to call his bluff after he really, you know... I told him, 'You know you're really wasting your time with me. I've got a billfold and this much change and that's it.' And he said, he told the girl, 'Go tie him up. I'd feel much better if you were tied up.' And she tied a couple of loose knots on me, so I made it look kind of tight... (unintelligible)... you know, just for a second, and he said 'Go ahead.' And I whispered to her, 'You know I think I can get that gun.' And I said, 'Do you mind?' and she got kind of fearful about it, so I figured since there's two lives involved, not just mine, I won't do it.
""So I let her tie me up on the wrists again, and he tied her up, - terribly tight, you know, real... (unintelligible) ... put his gun away, and we were talking and all, bantering, you know, basically. I was thinking, anything I can do to help, by the way just to keep the conversation going... Suddenly he was taking it all seriously, you know... So I was starting out and finally he said, 'Okay, lay down. I've got her tied up', you know... He strung a rope between our ankles in the rear, so we were like this, you know, on our stomachs, tied...
""J.R. You both facing the ground...
""B.H. Right. And, oh, this was before. I got sort of ahead. So anyway, he said, 'Get down,' and I said, 'Oh come on! We could freeze to death!' I said that a couple, three times, and he said, 'GET DOWN! RIGHT NOW!' He got a little pushed off at me. So I got down and then he finished tying her up and clonked her down, - and then he goes... Sswhooosh (a sound with his mouth)... (unintelligible)

""And so I said, 'Do you have bullets in there?' And so he pulled out the clip and showed me that he did. The bullets were about this long, I can remember, and about this fat, and they had the regular red cap on it, about this long. Maybe that doesn't give you any better description of the gun or not. I don't know. And it came out of the heel, the grip, you know. It slipped out from the bottom.
""And now, to backtrack a bit. I was really trying to see what he looked like, you know. He had on pleated pants, these old type of suit pants, you know, and they were either black or dark blue, I can't remember now. And I can't remember what he was wearing for shoes. But he had on this cotton coat, You've seen the kind, that you just turn the collar up once, there's a zipper down the front, you know. They're real light, super-thin, you know...
""J.R. Kind of a windbreaker...
""B.H. Yeah, like a windbreaker. And it's got this blue, this little collar, sometimes the guys wear them standing up, you know.
""J.R. What color was that?
""B.H. That was dark blue. And I don't know. Maybe he had something in his pouch. I just took it as being a... as being a... you know, he was stout 'cause he looked kind of heavy. I think he was weighing two and a quarter, two fifty, somewhere in there. And I got kind of a look at his hair. His voice... I can remember... almost like I'd heard it before. You know there's some drawls that a lot of people have similar. And... almost as if I'd heard it before... couldn't think where.
""I gave that one up, I just gave it up on that angle. I looked through his hair. I kind of looked like it was combed, you know, like this.. it was a brownish, you know, dark brown hair.
""And this mask he had on. It was ingeniously devised. It was... he had four corners at the top, like the top of a paper sack... black. It came down, came down, with the front panel about to here, and a kind of a thing that came over the shoulders, you know, and then the same thing down the back, straight down. And in the front he had a circle with a symmetrical cross in the middle. You know what I mean by a symmetrical cross?

""J.R. Um hum (affirmative).
""B.H. The ends of the cross hung out about this far on each of the... you know, where it came out. The circle was this much... like this... and then it was like this, you see... hung out on the end, over the edge of the circle.
""And he had clip-on sunglasses... it was hard to tell. You know, the sunglasses you clip on when you're wearing glasses, eyeglasses, He had those clipped on. I'm pretty sure... I don't think he had glasses, though. I think he just had these clipped on to his suit... you know, that little mask.
""And I don't know how tall he was. Maybe 5-8 or maybe 5-10, 6 feet, somewhere in there. I'm a very poor judge of height because of my height. I have no meaning, you know. It's always down, you know. It can never be up...
""And so I saw him put away his gun, and I was turning to say something to Celia, and all of a sudden I felt my back... just... no, I think I saw him pull it out.. I don't remember... I think I saw him whip out his knife and just start stabbing me in the back... CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP! I was just (makes a gutteral sound)... you know that kind of a sound... and Celia turned to see why I was (repeats gutteral sound), you know, and she just about fainted. She went hysterical... (unintelligible) ... and when he finally stopped... I mean he went over and... The doctor says there's six in the back, six wounds on my back. You ought to confirm that. One I've got went clear through the lung. I've got it draining. I did drain a couple pints of blood out as soon as I got here. I lost an awful lot of blood, I guess.
""We were down... I mean it was absolutely no question in my mind... when a person gets stabbed as many times as we did... we were going to die. I mean there'd be no reason to question it. But somehow I, you know, started (unintelligible)... I just knew there was too much I had to live for. I mean really it does happen... about getting depressed and everything... when you're young you always think about these things... you know you think about it... and when you've got someone forcing your hand, oh well, there was a lot of things I had to do. And what really kept me going... you know my parents are pretty Christian. I haven't been too much of a Christian myself... but if you believe in the principle you ask God to help you. Another thing, What was my only strength was knowing two things. One, that I did not want to die, and two, that I felt that whatever was

""going to be was going to be, but I was going to try my damnedest to stay alive. And so, like I say, - before I left her I kissed her, and I said, 'Well,' I says, 'I'm gonna try to get help.'
""There was a boat kept circling around out there in the lake and we started yelling at it and finally it came within about 100 yards of the shore and turned off its motor and stayed there watching us for about fifteen minutes, and we were just screaming hysterically, trying to get their attention, you know, to come over here. Oh, I don't know, I guess they were afraid that the guy might be there in the bushes and they were liable to get choked or something. So finally he came up a little closer. I didn't have my glasses on... I was just swaying, you know... and I had gotten one of her hands free before they came, and so I kept trying to get her to untie me, and she couldn't, she was too weak, she said.
""So finally I just kept hollering and hollering, and she said, 'Turn around and let's see if I can do it again.' She finally got it. My hands and my feet were just pure numbness... they're still numb but I'm sure that will go 'way. But I finally got... (unintelligible)... untie her so she could kind of relax out. 'Cause it was a terrible position, you know, upon our stomachs... (unintelligible)...
""And so I started to go for help. I finally got myself fairly reconciled. I wasn't too worried about dying, if that was what was going to happen, but I knew I had to keep pushing on. I had to force myself into staying alive because it was... I could just see myself... you know, all sort of waves would come over... I just (coughing sound)... (unintelligible)... 'Well, you're not gonna give up this easy', you know. And, like I say, I just kept believing that God would do everything the best, if the thing was gonna happen, but I couldn't see any reason why my dying would be the best good. So I just played along with that.
""I just started to walk toward the road... everything blacked out on me... my visual... my mind was never blacked out, but my visual was. So I lay down... My eyes started to come open... I just saw a haze of trees, you know. In a little while I got up and went another twenty feet, and then the same thing happened... (unintelligible)... and sat down. Next thing I went clear... (unintelligible)... the road, and by that time I just fell... I just... I was trying so hard to go far I just went too far. Finally I heard this pickup

""coming... I was just laying alongside the road, and that's where this guy picked me up.
""They weren't in any hurry at all, it didn't seem like, you know, but they finally called an ambulance. About fifteen minutes later it came... (unintelligible)... but I still believe... I've got feeling... starting to get a little pain to come through. But from the minute that knife blade went in, it was nothing but pure shock from there on. I just did not expect it. I didn't expect that he would do that. That was a variable I had completely left out. And I guess he just took off running after we started running. I don't know. I never saw him before and hope not to see him again... at least outside of a courtroom.
""It's hard for me to explain much more. I mean I'm trying to give you a kind of example of his technique. He had some rope cut up in his back pocket. And he had a ... well, I thought it was a police automatic because it was in one of these black leather cases, you know...
""J.R. Was it in a smooth case, or did it have a basket weave like..
""B.H. Can I have my glasses? Oh, they're not here. It was a smooth one, though.
""J.R. Did he have this hood down to about the middle of his chest?
""B.H. No, about like... well, I'll show you... Here... his stomach.. You know I could see his... (voice fades away)
""J.R. Okay. You said his hair looked dark brown. How could you see his hair?
""B.H. 'Cause I saw it from where those goggles fit. I looked so closely to find out. And when he turned you know they kind of flittered... I could see his hair. It looked kind of greasy.
""J.R. Now was he as heavy as I am?
""B.H. Well I can't say 'cause he wasn't wearing those type of clothes. They were sloppy clothes, you know. And he just had on this old pair of pleated pants. I don't know... How tall are you?
""J.R. I'm about five eleven.

Case INV 1-15-311-F9-5861
""B.H. Well, like I say, he was dressed kind of sloppily, you know. His pants real tight up here and his stomach kind of pouched a bit, you know. I don't know... it's hard to say 'cause I can't judge you with being in a suit and all, you know, and him not being professional-looking at all. He could be about the same. It's hard to say. He was so sloppily dressed.
""J.R. Bryan, you also mentioned a drawl. Well not a drawl, an accent.
""B.H. It was just something... I guess his way of talking. It was something I couldn't repeat. It's like a song. Sometimes you know what you're going to say but you just can't sing the melody worth a darn.
""J.R. Did he have a throaty voice or a high pitched?
""B.H. In between. But it was just a unique way of talking.
""J.R. Did he sound like an educated man?
""B.H. Heck no! I don't think so.
""J.R. Did he sound illiterate?
""B.H. No. He didn't sound that way either. He just impressed me as being rather low class. The reason was because of his clothes, you know.
""J.R. Did you lose consciousness when he stabbed you at any time? Did you observe him stab Cecelia?
""B.H. Yeah...
""J.R. What did he say after...
""B.H. He stabbed her a bunch of times in the back. After she turned around, he got her once in the groin and one in the arm I think. He kind of went a little more hog-wild with her than with me. I faked dead... like that... I didn't want him to come back and give me some more.
""J.R. So you were pretty sure he thought you were dead when he finished working on you?

""B.H. I think he kind of thought that. Of course I don't know because we started talking right after he left. It's hard to say... (unintelligible)... I don't think she fainted either.
""J.R. Was she in a lot of pain, did she tell you?
""B.H. Oh yeah. She was more weak at the time... (unintelligible).. from the religious angle. I told her I sure as heck wasn't going to have any deathbed conversion. 'No,' she says... (unintelligible)... I mean it was just like you were gonna die and had a few things to say. But I felt more and more I wasn't losing strength as much... (unintelligible)... that I thought I could cope with...
""J.R. What you did was a courageous thing. It was a terrible thing to have happen to anyone.
""B.H. Well there was nothing we could do. We were kind of at the mercy of him. I mean I wanted to get that gun... (unintelligible)... There was a time I think I could have gotten it...
""J.R. Did it appear to be a .45 to you? An automatic?
""B.H. It was about this long... along the stock... and had a wood edge on it, you know.. on either side...
""J.R. Handles.
""B.H. Yeah...yeah...
""J.R. Did the bullet look anything like that?
""B.H. No. It was kind of like this, only it was gold, and this part here came out along with this and then round the gold, round the blunt end. Not quite that blunt-ended, though.
""J.R. Was it fat? Fatter than this?
""B.H. Yeah, I think it was a little fatter. But it was gold, you know. And I didn't see any of this here. There was a part where it crimped... Well, almost like that 22, short, only a lot bigger. It was about like this length, maybe more stubby.

""J.R. Well I'll get a .45 a little later and we can bring it up and let you observe it.
""B.H. ""Let's take the suspect. His hands... I don't remember if they had gloves on or not. I can't remember now. I keep thinking that he had gloves on. I can't figure how he tied us... Let's ask Celia, she probably knows about that.
""J.R. Did he swear? Did he use any profane language or obscenity?
""B.H. I don't think so. If he did it was no more than I was using at the time. I don't think he used any obscenity. He might have used a swear word or something, you know. That wasn't striking to me...
""J.R. Do you have any idea what his motive might have been? Money?
""B.H. Money. He said he was going to go to Mexico and he was flat broke.
""J.R. Did he search you after he...
""B.H. Heck no! Very unprofessional. He didn't even end up taking that loose change and didn't even take my billfold.
""J.R. Why did he stab you when you weren't fighting him off or anything?
""B.H. I couldn't. Even if I'd have wanted to. I was laying on my stomach...
""J.R. So what would have been the purpose of him to stab you, do you think?
""B.H. Well I (unintelligible)...but I think he got rattled... (unintelligible)... very, very nervous. His hands were shaking... (unintelligible)... Are you nervous?
""J.R. I'm just curious. If you could write me that symbol you were telling me about. Do you think you could draw me a picture of that even without your glasses?
""B.H. Um hum (affirmative). (Draws)... kind of like that. I can't see very well...

""J.R. Does this ring a bell?
""B.H. This one here. This is more like it, but I'm not sure. It was distinctly that design. It was thick. More thick marks.
""J.R. Okay. What color was this? Do you recall?

CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his son would like to talk to them at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop regarding a possible suspect in this crime. 
At 0912 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan contacted DR. R. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his 16-yr. old son DAVID LEE RAYFIELD at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop. DR. RAYFIELD gave a home address of Los Gatos, California. DR. RAYFIELD stated that about 6:30 P.M. the previous evening he and his son had parked their car north of Park Headquarters in the general area of the crime scene. 
They stated they went down towards the beach area when DAVID RAYFIELD noticed a white male adult subject walking in the area, described as about 5'10"", heavy build, wearing dark trousers, a dark shirt with red in it, long sleeves. He stated this subject was carrying nothing in his hands and was apparently just walking alongside the hill area about halfway between the road and the lake. DAVID further stated that when the subject observed him he turned around and walked up the hill in a southerly direction. DR. RAYFIELD and his son stated that they did not notice a vehicle in the area of their vehicle and only this subject at a distance of about 100 yards. 
They also advised there was a man with two young boys in the area shooting B-B guns, but they did not know if this man saw the subject or not. This location was approximately 8/10ths of a mile from the scene of the victim's vehicle. In the opinion of R/Os, it is unlikely, unless this male subject had a vehicle in the immediate area, he could have traversed the area to the scene of the crime on foot. There are four coves of water between the scene of the crime and the area where the doctor saw the subject. The interview with DR. RAYFIELD and his son was terminated at that point.

MR. BYRD advised that MISS JUDY was a student at the college and had left the college earlier in the afternoon, driving a yellow Datsun. At 2135 hours Reporting Officers put out an All Points Bulletin around the City and County of Napa for this above described vehicle. At 2137 hours Officers received permission to interview the victim BRYAN HARTNELL who was taken to the X-Ray Room for x-rays. Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Lonergan attempted to interview BRYAN HARTNELL while in the presence of DONALD JUDAH and hospital attendant CLIFFORD MEAGHER. Sgt. Narlow was called away to answer a phone before the interview got under way. HARTNELL appeared to be in extreme pain and also appeared to be in shock. Reporting Officer Lonergan introduced himself to HARTNELL and asked him to give us any information he had on his assailant. HARTNELL stated that the assailant was wearing a black ceremonial type hood, square on top, and appeared to be heavy-set, between 200 and 250 pounds. He also stated his assailant had approached both him and MISS SHEPARD with a gun but had stabbed them with a long knife. HARTNELL further stated the gun was in a black holster and the knife was in a sheath. He stated that the attacker was wearing dark clothing, dark jacket and dark pants. HARTNELL further stated that the gun was an automatic pistol and the knife had a black handle and appeared to be homemade.
It should be noted that HARTNELL was very groggy and he was very difficult to interview at that time. Subject was re-interviewed the next day by Det/Sgt. Robertson and gave more complete details. (The report of Sgt. Robertson's interview is attached.)
At 2215 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan left the Queen of the Valley Hospital after advising Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and William Munk to take charge of the clothing of the victims and any other evidence from the victims when it was released from the hospital. Munk and Brambrink were also advised to stand by at the hospital as a security measure until other arrangements could be made.
As Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan were arriving at the Napa County Sheriff's Office, they were advised by the Napa Police Department that they had located MISS JUDY in the downtown Napa area and were bringing her to the Napa County Sheriff's Office. MISS [JUDY] was interviewed by Lonergan and Narlow at the Napa County Sheriff's Office. She was further identified as MISS JUDITH, a student at Pacific Union College, with a permanent residence address of Sun Valley, California. MISS [JUDITH] advised that she was with BRYAN

HARTNELL and CECELIA SHEPARD earlier in the afternoon. She stated that they all left Pacific Union College together at approximately 1:00 P.M. and went to a rummage sale in the City of St. Helena. She stated that BRYAN had bought a T.V. set at the rummage sale and had to transport it back to his room at Pacific Union College. She stated he left CECELIA at the rummage sale as there was not enough room in his car. MISS [JUDITH] stated BRYAN returned to the St. Helena area and picked up CECELIA at approximately 2:00 P.M. MISS [JUDITH] stated as far as she knew, both BRYAN and CECELIA were planning to go to San Francisco when they left her in St. Helena. MISS [JUDITH] stated she had no knowledge of any plans that BRYAN and CECELIA were making to go to the Lake Berryessa area. MISS [JUDITH] stated the last time she saw BRYAN and CECELIA was approximately 2:00 P.M. in the afternoon.
The interview with MISS [JUDITH] was terminated at that point.
Det/Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow then proceeded to Lake Berryessa and arrived at the scene of the crime, which was approximately a mile and a half north of Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters, at 2354 hours. The scene was being preserved by uniformed officers and under the direct control of Deputy Sheriffs David Collins and Ray Land. The investigating officers were briefed by Officers Collins and Land as to what had taken place prior to our arrival. Officers observed a 1956 white Kharman Ghia with a black vinyl top, Oregon license plate 4 U 2040. Investigating officers were shown footprints in dirt area and tire tracks, both believed to have been left by responsible. Investigating officers awaited the arrival of Sgt. Tom Butler who had been called to take photographs of the crime scene area and Sgt. Hal Snook, criminalist for collection and preservation of physical evidence. R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were advised by Park Ranger Dennis Land who had also arrived at the scene that it was possible to get to the beach area by vehicle from a locked gate approximately one-half mile south of the victim's vehicle. Officers proceeded to the area and arrived at the footpath approximately halfway between the scene of the crime at the beach and the victim's vehicle on the road. At that point, after a brief examination of the footpath area, officers discovered a similar footprint on the footpath to that found at the scene of the victim's vehicle. At that point, due to the lateness and darkness of the hour, Reporting Officers decided to completely secure the area and make a thorough search of the scene at first light. Officers then exited the crime scene area in the same manner and locked the aforementioned gate leading to this vicinity. Investigating officers along with Park Ranger Dennis Land went to the Berryessa Park Headquarters.

took into his possession certain items belonging to the victims that were taken into evidence by Ranger Dennis Land. These items consisted of a blanket, a pair of man's shoes, a wallet belonging to BRYAN HARTNELL, eyeglasses, and playing cards. Among the various aforementioned items believed to belong to the victims, were numerous strands of white plastic line cut into various assorted lengths, some of which had what appeared to be bloodstains. These items were subsequently turned over to Det/Sgt. Hal Snook for preservation.
Assigned investigators then proceeded back to the scene where the victim's car was parked and assisted Sgt. Snook in the making of the plaster casts. At approximately 0245 hours Sgt. Lonergan, having previously obtained the keys to the vehicle from BRYAN HARTNELL's property at Queen of the Valley Hospital, drove the white Kharman Ghia to the maintenance shop at Berryessa Park Headquarters. The vehicle was parked inside of the maintenance shop building and the building was secured for the evening by investigating officers with the assistance of Park Ranger Dennis Land. Assigned Investigators then returned back to the scene where the victim's vehicle had been previously parked and awaited the arrival of Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and Mel Fechter who were assigned to security duty in the crime scene area. At approximately 0300 hours officers assumed their duties at the crime scene area and the security was placed under the direction of Deputy Allen Brambrink. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then returned to their respective residences with plans to continue the investigation at daybreak.
9/28/69 0700 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene at Lake Berryessa area, accompanied by Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Capt. Donald Townsend, and Sgt. James Munk. Officers then assisted Det/Sgt. Snook in tracking the footprints from the vehicle to the scene of the crime by the beach area. (The location and preservation of aforementioned footprints will be detailed in a supplementary evidence report by Sgt. Snook.)
At 0800 hours Reporting Officers Lonergan and Narlow received information via Park Headquarters that a DR. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his son would like to talk to them at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop regarding a possible suspect in this crime. At 0912 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan contacted DR. R. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his 16-yr. old son DAVID LEE RAYFIELD at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop. DR. RAYFIELD gave a home address of Los Gatos, California. DR. RAYFIELD stated that about 6:30 P.M. the previous evening he and his son had parked their car north of Park Headquarters in the general area of the

crime scene. They stated they went down towards the beach area when DAVID RAYFIELD noticed a white male adult subject walking in the area, described as about 5'10"", heavy build, wearing dark trousers, a dark shirt with red in it, long sleeves. He stated this subject was carrying nothing in his hands and was apparently just walking alongside the hill area about halfway between the road and the lake. DAVID further stated that when the subject observed him he turned around and walked up the hill in a southerly direction. DR. RAYFIELD and his son stated that they did not notice a vehicle in the area of their vehicle and only this subject at a distance of about 100 yards. They also advised there was a man with two young boys in the area shooting B-B guns, but they did not know if this man saw the subject or not. This location was approximately 8/10ths of a mile from the scene of the victim's vehicle. In the opinion of R/Os, it is unlikely, unless this male subject had a vehicle in the immediate area, he could have traversed the area to the scene of the crime on foot. There are four coves of water between the scene of the crime and the area where the doctor saw the subject. The interview with DR. RAYFIELD and his son was terminated at that point.
At 1000 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene of the crime and further assisted Sgt. Snook in the collecting and locating of evidence.
At 1320 hours 9/28/69, R/Os interviewed Ranger Sgt. William White at Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters. White was interviewed as to his activities before and during his part in locating the victims the night before. White stated at approximately 1855 hours 9/27/69 he was on routine patrol around the Lake Berryessa area when he received a call from Park Headquarters to proceed to the Rancho Monticello Resort where a person was reporting a possible stabbing. 
White stated he proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort where he was contacted by ARCHIE E. WHITE, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG. RONALD FONG advised him that he had seen a male and a female victim on the beach area south of Rancho Monticello Resort, hollering that they had been stabbed. Ranger Sgt. White, accompanied by ARCHIE WHITE, ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the beach area via speedboat owned by ARCHIE WHITE. When they arrived on the beach they observed a young female lying on the ground with what appeared to be numerous stab wounds. Ranger Sgt. White stated that the female appeared to be in a great deal of pain. White stated as they discovered the female victim, Ranger Dennis Land arrived at the scene in his pickup truck, carrying a male victim who also appeared to have numerous stab wounds. White stated he immediately radioed in and had Park Headquarters call the Sheriff's Office to dispatch an ambulance and a Deputy. White stated he attempted to interview both the boy and girl victims while awaiting

arrival of the ambulance. According to White, the male victim said that a male subject approached them, wearing a hood, dressed in dark clothing. The subject was carrying what appeared to be an automatic pistol and stated that he wanted their money and car keys. According to White, the male victim related to him that the subject advised him he was an ex-con out of Colorado and was en route to Mexico. Suspect stated he had to tie them up, and after they were tied the responsible stated, ""I'm going to have to stab you."" White further related that the male victim advised the responsible, ""Stab me first, I can't stand to see her stabbed first."" The male victim then advised that the responsible stabbed him numerous times in the back and then stabbed the girl.
The female victim advised White that she could not see the responsible's face as a hood was covering all of his head. She also advised White that the suspect had what appeared to be clip-on sunglasses to cover his eyes. Ranger Sgt. White stated that this is the most he could get out of either victim as they were both in great shock and pain. White stated that he noticed a lot of blood near the girl's groin area. The interview with Ranger Sgt. White was terminated at that point.
9/28/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort and interviewed MR. ARCHIE E. WHITE. (It should be noted that ARCHIE E. WHITE and ELIZABETH WHITE are no relation to Ranger Sgt. White.) ARCHIE E. WHITE is the owner of the Boat Repair Shop at Rancho Monticello Resort. He lives at the Resort. Also interviewed were MR. WHITE's wife, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE. MR. and MRS. WHITE advised that they were contacted by RONALD FONG who advised them he had just observed what appeared to be a male and a female subject lying on the beach south of the Rancho Monticello Resort, covered with blood. FONG advised them that the couple had shouted out to him that they had been stabbed and robbed. MRS. WHITE immediately called Park Headquarters and Ranger Sgt. William White arrived at the Resort a short time later. MR. and MRS. WHITE, accompanied by Ranger Sgt. Bill White and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the scene area in one of MR. WHITE's ski boats. When they arrived on the scene, they observed a young female wearing a sweater dress lying on the beach, covered with blood. When they approached the area she was on her elbows and knees, rocking back and forth as if in great pain. MRS. WHITE stated she immediately attempted to make the victim more comfortable and tried to calm her down until the ambulance arrived. MRS. WHITE stated the girl advised him, ""He was a man with a hood... His face was covered... He was wearing black pants... It hurts, it

hurts."" MRS. WHITE then advised after the female had regained her composure, she told her the man had asked for money but didn't take any. She said she hadn't been raped. MRS. WHITE further advised that the female victim told her that the responsible was wearing glasses, with dark clip-on sunglasses over the hood. She told her that the responsible had a black pistol. MR. ARCHIE WHITE stated he overheard the male victim advise someone that the responsible was wearing gloves. MR. and MRS. WHITE further advised that this is the only information either victim gave them on the responsible, and that they spent the balance of the time attempting to make the victim more comfortable until the arrival of the ambulance.
After the interview with MR. and MRS. WHITE, Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan returned to the Napa County Sheriff's Office.
At 1620 hours R/O Det/Sgt. Narlow was contacted by a DEAN of the Pacific Union College in Angwin. DEAN advised that three young ladies, students at the college, might possibly have information as to a suspect in the attack at Lake Berryessa. The young ladies were identified as MISS JOANNE, MISS LINDA, and MISS LINDA. DEAN advised that these girls had been in the Lake Berryessa area from about 3:00 P.M. to 4:30 P.M. the previous Saturday afternoon. They had observed a male subject in a late model, silver blue Chevrolet, two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. DEAN advised that the girls had told him they were observed out of the car by this subject while they were sunbathing on the beach. They described the subject as approximately 40 years old, [blank] feet tall, dressed in dark clothing. Sgt. Narlow dispatched Deputy Sheriff Raymond Land to interview these three girls that evening. (The report of Land's interview is attached.)
Reporting Officers spent the balance of the day and evening going through their investigative notes and issuing a statewide All Points Bulletin.
Monday, 9/29/69 Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan spent the majority of the morning interviewing numerous citizens and officers from other departments regarding this crime and similar crimes. (A general list of possible suspects was begun and they are noted on separate incident reports as to origin of information and description of suspects, attached.)
Reporting Officers were advised by Deputy Sheriff Ray Land who interviewed the three college girls, MISS [JOANNE], MISS [LINDA], and MISS [LINDA] that the information appeared to have some merit and advised that the three young ladies would be in the office in the afternoon for further interview.

9/29/69 1445 hours The three young ladies came into the office and were interviewed by Sgt. Lonergan, Sgt. Snook, and Capt. Donald Townsend.
Lonergan interviewed a MISS JOANNE MARIE, who, [age] years of age, DOB [blank], her address at the college is 114 Dauphine, Pacific Union College, home address South East 12th, College Place, Washington. MISS [JOANNE] advised R/O that on 9/27/69 at approximately 5:30 P.M. she and her two girlfriends parked their vehicle at a location two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. When they left their car they noticed a subject driving a late model silver blue Chevrolet, 2-door sedan, pull up behind them. What appeared to be a white male adult was sitting in the vehicle. They did not observe this subject leave the vehicle. The girls proceeded to the beach area and were sunbathing in their bikinis. After approximately one-half hour had passed, they observed what appeared to be the same subject standing within 40 or 50 feet of them, apparently observing them. This subject was described as 6' tall, weighing 200/210 lbs., muscular build, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing dark pants and a dark pullover shirt. The subject would stare at the three girls but when they looked up at him he would look away. The subject hung around the area for approximately 45 minutes and then the girls observed him walk up the hill. MISS [JOANNE] stated it was very doubtful that from his vantage point in the vehicle the subject could observe the three girls on the beach. She believes he waited in his vehicle and then followed them down after they were on the beach. MISS [JOANNE] further described the car as appearing very conservative. She stated the car did not appear to belong to any young person such as a teenager. She did state the car had California license plates but did not notice the number.
The other two young ladies, MISS [LINDA] and MISS [LINDA] were interviewed by Sgt. Snook and Capt. Donald Townsend.
MISS LINDA who was interviewed by R/O Det/Sgt. Snook, is a WFA, DOB [blank], home address Sunnyside Road, Sanitarium. She stated she left the Angwin area with two other girls, JOANNE and LINDA at approximately 2:45 P.M. 9/27/69. The girls drove through Pope Valley to Lake Berryessa where they parked their vehicle two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand. MISS [LINDA] stated she observed a subject go into the parking lot area to the south. Subject went past their vehicle and backed up so their rear bumpers were nearly touching. Vehicle described as a 1966 or 1967 light blue Chevrolet with California plates. Witness believes the vehicle was a 2-door sedan and described the headlights as being long rather than round. The rear window glass was tinted quite dark. Another vehicle from Angwin with Arizona plates was in the parking area and witness saw the occupants, a MISS DENISE BROWN and a MR. WAYNE HAIGHT.

to the beach and shortly thereafter noticed the male subject watching them from the edge of the trees. After about 30 minutes the subject came down by the beach and passed within 20 feet of witness as he walked from south to north. Subject was described by MISS [LINDA] as approximately 28 years of age, 6' to 6'2"" tall, 200/225 lbs., black hair possibly styled, with a part on left, rounded eyes, thin lips, medium nose, straight eyebrows, small ears, well built, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing a black short-sleeved sweater shirt, bunched up in front, and a white tee shirt hanging out in back, and dark trousers. The three girls left the area about 4:30 P.M. and the subject's vehicle was gone. Witnesses did not observe the subject either leave or get back into his vehicle.
MISS LINDA LEE was interviewed by R/O Capt. Donald Townsend. MISS [LINDA LEE] is a WFA, DOB [blank], address Howell Mountain Road, Angwin. MISS [LINDA LEE] is employed as a secretary of the college press. MISS [LINDA LEE] observed the same vehicle which was described as a late model Chevrolet, sky blue in color. The rear tail lights appeared to be long rather than round. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated they parked their vehicle at approximately 2:55 P.M. and observed the subject in his vehicle at that location. The girls proceeded to the beach and she, MISS [LINDA LEE], again noticed the subject about 30 to 45 minutes after they were at the beach. She noticed him standing on the bank approximately 45 yards from her location. She described the subject as 6 feet tall, stocky build, about 200 lbs., black short-sleeved sweater shirt, dark blue slacks, and straight dark hair neatly combed. She guessed his age at approximately 30 years. Subject had medium color skin and was not wearing glasses. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated she thought she saw a white belt around his back but it possibly was a tee shirt hanging out. She further stated that the man was fairly nice-looking, with a round face. She did not observe the subject leave the area in his vehicle.
9/29/69 - 1600 hours Reporting Officers Sgt. Narlow and Sgt. Lonergan were advised by Capt. Joseph Page that the female victim, MISS CECELIA SHEPARD, had just died at Queen of the Valley Hospital. Capt. Page, who is Chief Napa County Coroner, stated he would handle the case and contact DR. DE PETRIS who would perform the autopsy the next morning. Capt. Page further advised R/Os that the remains would be removed to Morrison Funeral Home where DR. DE PETRIS would complete the autopsy.
At 1945 hours 9/29/69, R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were contacted by Probation Officer H. B. Schotte. Mr. Schotte had observed the footprint design that R/Os had taken at the scene and stated he had knowledge of a possible similar shoe sole design. Mr. Schotte brought into the office a MR.

Air Force Base and is a Flight Line Mechanic. He is a retired Master Sergeant in the United States Air Force. MR. [BASSEL] showed R/O a pair of Air Force chukker boots that belonged to him. He described these boots as being Government issue, issued to all Air Force personnel at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. They are primarily designed as a wing-walker shoe, however according to MR. [BASSEL] most Air Force personnel and many of the civilian personnel employed at Air Force bases had this type of shoe. The sole design of this shoe exactly matched the plaster cast design that Sgt. Snook had taken at the scene of the crime. It should be noted that Det/Sgt John Robertson had attempted to find a similar shoe design at the local shoe stores in the Napa area with negative results. (Refer Sgt. Robertson's supplementary report.) MR. [BASSEL] was asked if we could keep his shoes for identification purposes and he agreed. R/Os was also advised that this information regarding the type of footprint had not been released to the press or general public. MR. [BASSEL] stated he would cooperate with R/Os and keep this information confidential.
9/30/69, 0810 hours R/O Sgt. Lonergan received a telephone call from MISS MARILYN DENISE, 18 years of age, DOB [blank]. MISS [MARILYN] is a student at Pacific Union College and resides at Andre Hall, Room B-3. MISS [MARILYN] stated that about 5:15 P.M. Saturday, 9/27/69 she was in the Lake Berryessa area with a male companion, MR. JOHN, 22 years of age, also a student at Pacific Union College. She stated at this time they were parked on the Knoxville Road approximately one mile south of the Lake Berryessa Marina. She stated shortly after they parked the vehicle they observed the victims who were known to them, BRYAN HARTNELL and CECELIA SHEPARD, driving south on Knoxville Road in BRYAN's white Kharman Ghia. She stated as the HARTNELL vehicle drove by, BRYAN waved out the window and said, ""Hi, John!"", referring to MR. [JOHN]. MISS [MARILYN] stated that they did not see the HARTNELL vehicle any other time that day.
9/30/69, 0900 hours R/Os Det/Sgt. Narlow and Det/Sgt. Richard Lonergan, accompanied by Sgt. Thomas Butler, proceeded to the Morrison Funeral Home in St. Helena.

advised that the cause of death was shock and loss of blood brought on by two main stab wounds.
9/30/69, 1430 hours R/O Det/Sgt. Kenneth Narlow contacted CAPT. at Travis Air Force Base and arranged for an interview with COL. and SGT. to take place on Wednesday morning, October 1st, 1969, at 9:00 A.M. R/Os wanted to talk to someone at Travis regarding the shoeprints that were found on the scene. The remainder of the day and evening was spent in answering phone calls from people who had possible knowledge of the crime.
Wednesday, 10/1/69 - 0900 hours Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow went to Travis Air Force Base and were present at an interview in Col. office, who is Commanding Officer in charge of base security. Also present at this meeting besides the aforementioned officers was LT. COL. of the Office of Special Investigation. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan advised the Air Force personnel present of the portion of the evidence we had discovered at the crime scene and asked them for assistance in locating where this type of shoe was sold or issued. LT. COL. advised that his office would assist assigned investigators in attempting to locate the source of the shoe.
Officers were directed to the Base Supply with the assistance of Special Agent DONALD of O.S.I., at which time it was determined through Base Supply that this shoe in question was of Government issue and that it was not kept in stock at Base Supply, however it was believed that the Sales Store had such an item. It was then explained that if a military person or civilian employee was determined to be in need of such an item, he first reported to the Base Supply, at which time he was issued a purchase requisition which he in turn took to the Sales Store and the type of shoe was issued to the individual and they in turn required the individual to sign the purchase requisition showing that he did receive the item. This purchase requisition states the type of shoe that the individual was to receive, however makes no reference as to size.
Assigned investigators, accompanied by Special Agent proceeded to the Sales Store located on Travis Air Force Base. After a short period of time R/Os located in stock a shoe fitting the identical description of the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast which officers had in their possession. The identical shoe with identical tread was found and a shoe bearing the closest measurements in the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast was measured and found to be a size 10 1/2 in military styling or a 10 1/2 D in civilian equivalent. It was determined through Air Force records that they were unable to furnish officers with the

data regarding the sales of this type shoe due to the fact that no recordings were made of the specific sizes, however purchase records indicate over the past 13 months approximately 100 pairs of this size shoe, namely 10 1/2, had been purchased and disposed of through sales. Air Force records indicate this type shoe is manufactured by the International Shoe Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, then shipped to Air Force Depot, Ogden, Utah, and from there shipped to the various military installations upon requisition orders.
10/1/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then proceeded to the Vallejo Police Department and met with Sgt. Jack Mullanax and Sgt. Duane Nilsson. Officers exchanged information regarding Vallejo's crime of 7/4/69 and our particular incident. Suspect information was exchanged and is listed in the separate suspect file.
Investigating Officers checked to determine the validity of the decoded message and as to how far the original cyphers had been decoded. It was then learned that the message had been decoded by at least two different sources, one being by MR. and MRS. HARDIN of Salinas and the other by the FBI in Washington. It was noted that these cyphers were broken independent of one another and the FBI confirmed the validity of the original decoded message. It was also learned that there was a small portion on the very end of the coded message that had not been decoded for reasons unknown.
The balance of the afternoon and evening Reporting Officers and other investigating officers met to exchange information and further discuss the evidence at hand.
Thursday, October 2nd, 1969, 0845 hours Reporting Officer Lonergan received a telephone call from Special Agent, OSI, Travis Air Force Base. Subject called to report that approximately 500 to 1,000 of that type of wing-walker shoe have been sold as surplus on the Base. This would be over and above those sold at the Sales Store. Agent further related he has the names of all the subjects who have purchased this item through surplus and will keep these names available to officers upon request.
The balance of the morning was spent searching fingerprint evidence and answering phone calls from possible witnesses.
Thursday, 10/2/69, 1400 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan attended the funeral services for victim CECELIA SHEPARD. These services were held at the Pacific Union College Church, Angwin, California. Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan positioned themselves

inside the church in order to observe all persons who viewed the services and the remains of victim CECELIA SHEPARD. Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Sgt. Thomas Butler, and Detective Ronald Montgomery of the Napa Police Department positioned themselves outside the church and photographed all persons entering and leaving the services. This included individual photographs and group scenes. Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow also attended the graveside services at the St. Helena Cemetery in St. Helena.
Friday, 10/3/69 - Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Richard Lonergan contacted JAMES, Napa State Hospital, advised him to set up an interview with a patient who is a possible suspect in our case. The patient is identified as GRIFFIN RAYMOND FRANKLIN, WMA, 20 yrs. of age, DOB [blank], 6'2"", 223 lbs. [JAMES] had previously reported that this subject had left the hospital on a pass Friday evening, 9/26/69, and returned to the hospital Monday afternoon, 9/29/69. This subject also had spent time in the Air Force and was discharged from the Air Force in January 1969 for psychiatric problems. According to the doctors at the hospital, this subject was capable of committing this type of a crime. R/O in the presence of JAMES and Security Officer PHIL RYAN interviewed subject FRANKLIN. FRANKLIN was very cooperative and talkative to R/O and went over his activities the prior weekend. Briefly stated, MR. FRANKLIN, whose parents live in Vallejo, never left the Vallejo area that weekend and stayed around home talking with his mother, stepfather, and three brothers. After interviewing subject, it was the opinion of R/O Sgt. Lonergan that this subject was not the responsible. He had a definite very fast manner of speaking which was completely opposed to the victim's statement concerning the suspect's voice. R/O also contacted the mother of the suspect, a MRS. OPAL at Hollywood Avenue, Vallejo. MRS. OPAL stated more or less the exact same thing that her son had stated as to his whereabouts that weekend. It appears that this subject has a reliable alibi as to his activities and had no access to a vehicle that weekend. This subject was cleared as far as this crime is concerned.
The balance of the morning and afternoon was spent by R/Os Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan going over physical evidence and dictating reports.
Investigation continuing.

9/28/69 12:30 P.M. Reporting Officer John Robertson, Det/Sgt., interviewed one of two victims who were each stabbed numerous times by an unknown assailant. Victim CECELIA SHEPARD and victim BRYAN HARTNELL both had been placed in the Queen of the Valley Hospital intensive care unit. Victim SHEPARD had surgery performed on her earlier in the morning (9/28/69) and was unable to be questioned by the Reporting Officer, however Dr. Ludwig gave permission for victim HARTNELL to be interviewed.
Although victim HARTNELL was heavily sedated, he was able to give R/O a verbal statement. (Note: R/O taped electrically the interview with victim HARTNELL.) Victim HARTNELL related the following.
He had known CECELIA SHEPARD for some time, they were good friends, and she had come to the Napa County area to spend the weekend. She and a female companion, DALORA LEE, Aspen, Loma Linda, San Bernardino County, Calif. (phone Ext. 2155) had driven from Southern California and were to drive back Sunday, 9/28/69. Victim stated he and MISS SHEPARD drove to Lake Berryessa, picked a large tree near the shore line where they decided to lie down and enjoy the scenery. While lying on the ground, victim HARTNELL stated he heard a noise and asked MISS SHEPARD if she could hear anything or see anything behind a tree not far from where the couple were lying. MISS SHEPARD told victim HARTNELL she could see a man behind the tree. HARTNELL asked her what he was doing. MISS SHEPARD stated she couldn't tell. HARTNELL stated he (suspect) then came from behind the tree. MISS SHEPARD said, ""Oh my God, he has a gun!""
Victim HARTNELL stated the man approached the couple, aiming a black steel automatic pistol. The suspect stated he needed a car and money. Suspect stated his car was ""hot"" and he wanted victim HARTNELL's car keys. Victim HARTNELL stated he began talking with the suspect, telling the suspect he had no money, only a small amount of change, also that if the suspect was really in need of assistance HARTNELL would attempt to help him. The suspect told victim to get on the ground. Suspect then had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him. HARTNELL stated he attempted to keep the suspect engaged in conversation while suspect was tying the victims.
HARTNELL further stated the suspect was described as follows: Wearing a black hooded mask (cloth), covering suspect's entire head and shoulders, coming down almost to suspect's waist. Victim stated on front of the four-cornered type mask (similar to paper bag in style) there was a symbol, the symbol described as white, approximately 3 x 3 inches in diameter, with a symmetrical cross. Also on the eyelets of the mask was a pair of clip-on sunglasses, the glasses clipped to the eyelets. Victim stated he could also see hair through the mask's eyelets and observed the hair to be dark brown.
Victim stated suspect was wearing a light-weight windbreaker, dark blue or black, pleated slacks (old-fashioned type). Victim could not remember what type of shoes or anything about suspect's hands, could not remember if suspect was wearing gloves.
Victim thought suspect was possibly 20 to 30 years of age by voice concept. Victim stated suspect was 5'8"" to 6', 225-250 lbs., dark brown hair, eyes unknown, sloppy dresser, stomach hanging over trousers. Suspect spoke with some

type of drawl, but victim stated it was not a Southern drawl, did not really know what type of drawl, but thought the man was not well educated, but did not feel he was illiterate either. Victim said suspect's voice was moderate in sound, that is, not high or low pitched.
Suspect told victim he was sent to (?) Lodge State Prison (possibly Deer Lodge State Prison), Montana, for a killing. While there (in prison) he killed a guard while escaping. Suspect also told victims he was heading for Mexico, told victim he was flat broke.
Victim observed cut-up rope in suspect's rear pocket (trouser's), also stated he was wearing a knife in a case (on belt) on his right side, near front of trousers. Knife description: Appeared to be a long bread knife, 12"" long blade, 3/4"" wide, hardwood handle, 2 brass rivets holding handle in place, cotton surgical tape wrapped approximately 1"" around handle of knife. Knife case possibly made of wood.
Victim asked suspect if suspect's gun was loaded. Suspect removed magazine from handle of pistol and showed victim a bullet removed from gun, bullet described as a possible .45 caliber. Victim did not know what caliber the pistol was.
Suspect had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him, suspect then tied victim SHEPARD's hands, then re-tied HARTNELL's hands, then tied both victims' ankles together, had victims lie on their stomachs. HARTNELL stated suspect said, ""I'm getting nervous."" This was when suspect was tying MISS SHEPARD'S hands, in fact HARTNELL stated suspect got real shaky when he was tying MISS SHEPARD's hands.
Victim HARTNELL then stated that without warning the suspect plunged his knife into the back of HARTNELL. Suspect did this repeatedly, HARTNELL stated he thinks six times. HARTNELL stated he pretended to be dead and the suspect went over to MISS SHEPARD and stabbed MISS SHEPARD repeatedly in the back, and when MISS SHEPARD turned her body over (on back), suspect stabbed her in the lower abdomen. Victim stated suspect stabbed MISS SHEPARD much worse than him. Suspect went into some sort of frenzy when stabbing MISS SHEPARD.
Victim HARTNELL stated suspect left the area after the stabbing. Victim HARTNELL hailed a boat (off shore) and told the man in the boat the couple needed help badly. Victim stated the boat left the area and he (victim) attempted to get help by crawling and walking to the road. (Victim believed he had walked to the road, however had not gone too far from his wounded companion.)
Victim stated he thought suspect had been with the couple for approximately fifteen (15) minutes from time of observing suspect until suspect departed. Victim stated suspect did not take his wallet, although when MISS SHEPARD was tying victim HARTNELL's hands, she reached in his pocket and threw his wallet to suspect. Suspect did not take the wallet or victim's car keys.
Victim stated a man in a pickup truck found him on the road and called an ambulance. Victim stated he estimated one hour in time was involved between the time he and MISS SHEPARD were stabbed until help arrived.
MISS SHEPARD is listed in critical condition.

Sgt. ROBERTSON stated that Mr. HARTNELL was heavily sedated but was able to give a verbal statement pertaining to the attack at Lake Berrysessa. The interview was taped and reads as follows:
""INTERVIEW OF JOHN ROBERTSON, DET/SGT., NAPA COUNTY SHERIFF's DEPARTMENT, WITH BRYAN CALVIN HARTNELL (NSO CASE #105907) AT QUEEN OF THE VALLEY HOSPITAL ON SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1969 (TRANSCRIBED FROM TAPE RECORDING BY M. FEURLE):
""J.R. Can you give me this fellow's description and tell me what happened?
""B.H. So many people have been asking me... I hope...
""J.R. Well sometimes when we're repetitious, I know it happens to me, I tell the same thing over and over and over, and sometimes I might vary a little, and if you do...
""B.H. Shall I just start out and tell you what happened?
""J.R. I don't want to tire you out.
""B.H. I just don't want this to happen again to anybody... Of course he might have his reasons, I don't know...
""J.R. Okay. Go right ahead. Start right from the beginning. What happened?
""B.H. Okay. This girl came out from school, I used to go with her two years ago, and she's now going to another school, and she came up to visit some friends and we were having dinner at the school cafeteria, and I said, 'Well, are you doing anything special this afternoon?' and she said, 'Why?', and I said, 'I don't know. We could go out and either go for a walk, go to San Francisco, or, you know, just...', 'cause we used to be good friends. We used to have a good friendship. And so it got too late by the time we got around to what we were going to do. We had to stop in St. Helena for a couple items and then we had to cart a couple kids home and stuff, and by the time we finally got around to it, it was getting late, and I thought going to San Francisco 'd rush you, you know, because by the time we got back for worship... And so we went out to Berryessa, and there was this one place I used to go out... we used to all the time, you know... and I couldn't find it. And so I figured Ah, forget it, and this looks like as good a place as any. So I parked the car, there were no other cars there. I had a Kharman Ghia, '56, white, with a black vinyl top, and it's in pretty

... ""good-looking shape. But we parked there on the road's edge and we talked Oh it must be about a quarter of a mile to down to the place where we went. We had... (unintelligible) peninsula, it's an an island I guess during the wetter season, You can see where it was levee... And so that looked like a lot... there was a big spreading tree up there. There were two of them, really, one was a little bigger than the other. We took the one that was out on the point.
""It was really beautiful out there. We were sitting on top... I lay down on my back and she lay down on her stomach beside me, you know, kind of resting her head on my shoulder, and we were talking, you know, kind of reminiscing about old times, and stuff. And I heard these rustling leaves, and I said, 'You have your specs on. Why don't you see what the deal is over there?' And she says, 'Oh, it's some man.' And I said, 'Is he alone?' and she said, 'Yeah... (unintelligible)...' and she says, 'Well he just stepped behind the tree.' And I said, 'What's the idea of that? To take a leak?' You know, 'cause that's the only thing I could think of, just step behind a tree. And so I says, 'Well, keep looking and tell me what happens,' and she says, 'Oh my God, he's got a gun!' and squeezed my arm and
""And so he came out, and of course still actually I wasn't... There's some things you really wouldn't mind having happen, just for the experience of it. You know I thought, Well I only got fifty cents on me. It's worth all of that having it happen. I didn't think about another angle. So I talked to him, you know. I said, 'Well listen, Mac, (you know I'm in the sociologist field, you know, I'm pre-law, with history and psych.) You know I've read about the criminal mind and everything, you know. I thought well maybe the guy really does need help, you know. I says, 'There's no strings attached.' I says, 'I don't have any money right now but if you need help that badly I can help you out in another way maybe.' And he says, 'Nah.. time's running short,' he says, ''cause I just got out of... some prison in Montana, I don't know what the name of it is. Feathers? Do you know what the name of it is? I'll see if it sounds familiar. Fern or Feathers? It's some double name, like Fern Lock or something...
""J.R. It's Lodge..

""B.H. Oh yeah, yeah, Lodge. At least we know we're together on that.
""J.R. Mountain Lodge Prison, or something of that nature...
""B.H. Yeah. You know he said he broke out and had to kill a guard getting out. And I said, 'Well, man, I mean actually I don't mean to call your bluff or anything, but wouldn't you rather be stuck on a stealing charge than a threat of homicide?' you know? And he says, 'Well just don't start playing hero on me.' You know, 'Don't try to grab the gun,' 'cause I didn't really figure the gun was loaded. I always thought it would be empty. I've heard a lot of times that this is what they do just as a bluff, but I decided not to call his bluff after he really, you know... I told him, 'You know you're really wasting your time with me. I've got a billfold and this much change and that's it.' And he said, he told the girl, 'Go tie him up. I'd feel much better if you were tied up.' And she tied a couple of loose knots on me, so I made it look kind of tight... (unintelligible)... you know, just for a second, and he said 'Go ahead.' And I whispered to her, 'You know I think I can get that gun.' And I said, 'Do you mind?' and she got kind of fearful about it, so I figured since there's two lives involved, not just mine, I won't do it.
""So I let her tie me up on the wrists again, and he tied her up, - terribly tight, you know, real... (unintelligible) ... put his gun away, and we were talking and all, bantering, you know, basically. I was thinking, anything I can do to help, by the way just to keep the conversation going... Suddenly he was taking it all seriously, you know... So I was starting out and finally he said, 'Okay, lay down. I've got her tied up', you know... He strung a rope between our ankles in the rear, so we were like this, you know, on our stomachs, tied...
""J.R. You both facing the ground...
""B.H. Right. And, oh, this was before. I got sort of ahead. So anyway, he said, 'Get down,' and I said, 'Oh come on! We could freeze to death!' I said that a couple, three times, and he said, 'GET DOWN! RIGHT NOW!' He got a little pushed off at me. So I got down and then he finished tying her up and clonked her down, - and then he goes... Sswhooosh (a sound with his mouth)... (unintelligible)

""And so I said, 'Do you have bullets in there?' And so he pulled out the clip and showed me that he did. The bullets were about this long, I can remember, and about this fat, and they had the regular red cap on it, about this long. Maybe that doesn't give you any better description of the gun or not. I don't know. And it came out of the heel, the grip, you know. It slipped out from the bottom.
""And now, to backtrack a bit. I was really trying to see what he looked like, you know. He had on pleated pants, these old type of suit pants, you know, and they were either black or dark blue, I can't remember now. And I can't remember what he was wearing for shoes. But he had on this cotton coat, You've seen the kind, that you just turn the collar up once, there's a zipper down the front, you know. They're real light, super-thin, you know...
""J.R. Kind of a windbreaker...
""B.H. Yeah, like a windbreaker. And it's got this blue, this little collar, sometimes the guys wear them standing up, you know.
""J.R. What color was that?
""B.H. That was dark blue. And I don't know. Maybe he had something in his pouch. I just took it as being a... as being a... you know, he was stout 'cause he looked kind of heavy. I think he was weighing two and a quarter, two fifty, somewhere in there. And I got kind of a look at his hair. His voice... I can remember... almost like I'd heard it before. You know there's some drawls that a lot of people have similar. And... almost as if I'd heard it before... couldn't think where.
""I gave that one up, I just gave it up on that angle. I looked through his hair. I kind of looked like it was combed, you know, like this.. it was a brownish, you know, dark brown hair.
""And this mask he had on. It was ingeniously devised. It was... he had four corners at the top, like the top of a paper sack... black. It came down, came down, with the front panel about to here, and a kind of a thing that came over the shoulders, you know, and then the same thing down the back, straight down. And in the front he had a circle with a symmetrical cross in the middle. You know what I mean by a symmetrical cross?

Case INV 1-15-311-F9-5861
""J.R. Um hum (affirmative).
""B.H. The ends of the cross hung out about this far on each of the... you know, where it came out. The circle was this much... like this... and then it was like this, you see... hung out on the end, over the edge of the circle.
""And he had clip-on sunglasses... it was hard to tell. You know, the sunglasses you clip on when you're wearing glasses, eyeglasses, He had those clipped on. I'm pretty sure... I don't think he had glasses, though. I think he just had these clipped on to his suit... you know, that little mask.
""And I don't know how tall he was. Maybe 5-8 or maybe 5-10, 6 feet, somewhere in there. I'm a very poor judge of height because of my height. I have no meaning, you know. It's always down, you know. It can never be up...
""And so I saw him put away his gun, and I was turning to say something to Celia, and all of a sudden I felt my back... just... no, I think I saw him pull it out.. I don't remember... I think I saw him whip out his knife and just start stabbing me in the back... CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP! I was just (makes a gutteral sound)... you know that kind of a sound... and Celia turned to see why I was (repeats gutteral sound), you know, and she just about fainted. She went hysterical... (unintelligible) ... and when he finally stopped... I mean he went over and... The doctor says there's six in the back, six wounds on my back. You ought to confirm that. One I've got went clear through the lung. I've got it draining. I did drain a couple pints of blood out as soon as I got here. I lost an awful lot of blood, I guess.
""We were down... I mean it was absolutely no question in my mind... when a person gets stabbed as many times as we did... we were going to die. I mean there'd be no reason to question it. But somehow I, you know, started (unintelligible)... I just knew there was too much I had to live for. I mean really it does happen... about getting depressed and everything... when you're young you always think about these things... you know you think about it... and when you've got someone forcing your hand, oh well, there was a lot of things I had to do. And what really kept me going... you know my parents are pretty Christian. I haven't been too much of a Christian myself... but if you believe in the principle you ask God to help you. Another thing, What was my only strength was knowing two things. One, that I did not want to die, and two, that I felt that whatever was

""going to be was going to be, but I was going to try my damnedest to stay alive. And so, like I say, - before I left her I kissed her, and I said, 'Well,' I says, 'I'm gonna try to get help.'
""There was a boat kept circling around out there in the lake and we started yelling at it and finally it came within about 100 yards of the shore and turned off its motor and stayed there watching us for about fifteen minutes, and we were just screaming hysterically, trying to get their attention, you know, to come over here. Oh, I don't know, I guess they were afraid that the guy might be there in the bushes and they were liable to get choked or something. So finally he came up a little closer. I didn't have my glasses on... I was just swaying, you know... and I had gotten one of her hands free before they came, and so I kept trying to get her to untie me, and she couldn't, she was too weak, she said.
""So finally I just kept hollering and hollering, and she said, 'Turn around and let's see if I can do it again.' She finally got it. My hands and my feet were just pure numbness... they're still numb but I'm sure that will go 'way. But I finally got... (unintelligible)... untie her so she could kind of relax out. 'Cause it was a terrible position, you know, upon our stomachs... (unintelligible)...
""And so I started to go for help. I finally got myself fairly reconciled. I wasn't too worried about dying, if that was what was going to happen, but I knew I had to keep pushing on. I had to force myself into staying alive because it was... I could just see myself... you know, all sort of waves would come over... I just (coughing sound)... (unintelligible)... 'Well, you're not gonna give up this easy', you know. And, like I say, I just kept believing that God would do everything the best, if the thing was gonna happen, but I couldn't see any reason why my dying would be the best good. So I just played along with that.
""I just started to walk toward the road... everything blacked out on me... my visual... my mind was never blacked out, but my visual was. So I lay down... My eyes started to come open... I just saw a haze of trees, you know. In a little while I got up and went another twenty feet, and then the same thing happened... (unintelligible)... and sat down. Next thing I went clear... (unintelligible)... the road, and by that time I just fell... I just... I was trying so hard to go far I just went too far. Finally I heard this pickup

""coming... I was just laying alongside the road, and that's where this guy picked me up.
""They weren't in any hurry at all, it didn't seem like, you know, but they finally called an ambulance. About fifteen minutes later it came... (unintelligible)... but I still believe... I've got feeling... starting to get a little pain to come through. But from the minute that knife blade went in, it was nothing but pure shock from there on. I just did not expect it. I didn't expect that he would do that. That was a variable I had completely left out. And I guess he just took off running after we started running. I don't know. I never saw him before and hope not to see him again... at least outside of a courtroom.
""It's hard for me to explain much more. I mean I'm trying to give you a kind of example of his technique. He had some rope cut up in his back pocket. And he had a ... well, I thought it was a police automatic because it was in one of these black leather cases, you know...
""J.R. Was it in a smooth case, or did it have a basket weave like..
""B.H. Can I have my glasses? Oh, they're not here. It was a smooth one, though.
""J.R. Did he have this hood down to about the middle of his chest?
""B.H. No, about like... well, I'll show you... Here... his stomach.. You know I could see his... (voice fades away)
""J.R. Okay. You said his hair looked dark brown. How could you see his hair?
""B.H. 'Cause I saw it from where those goggles fit. I looked so closely to find out. And when he turned you know they kind of flittered... I could see his hair. It looked kind of greasy.
""J.R. Now was he as heavy as I am?
""B.H. Well I can't say 'cause he wasn't wearing those type of clothes. They were sloppy clothes, you know. And he just had on this old pair of pleated pants. I don't know... How tall are you?
""J.R. I'm about five eleven.

""B.H. Well, like I say, he was dressed kind of sloppily, you know. His pants real tight up here and his stomach kind of pouched a bit, you know. I don't know... it's hard to say 'cause I can't judge you with being in a suit and all, you know, and him not being professional-looking at all. He could be about the same. It's hard to say. He was so sloppily dressed.
""J.R. Bryan, you also mentioned a drawl. Well not a drawl, an accent.
""B.H. It was just something... I guess his way of talking. It was something I couldn't repeat. It's like a song. Sometimes you know what you're going to say but you just can't sing the melody worth a darn.
""J.R. Did he have a throaty voice or a high pitched?
""B.H. In between. But it was just a unique way of talking.
""J.R. Did he sound like an educated man?
""B.H. Heck no! I don't think so.
""J.R. Did he sound illiterate?
""B.H. No. He didn't sound that way either. He just impressed me as being rather low class. The reason was because of his clothes, you know.
""J.R. Did you lose consciousness when he stabbed you at any time? Did you observe him stab Cecelia?
""B.H. Yeah...
""J.R. What did he say after...
""B.H. He stabbed her a bunch of times in the back. After she turned around, he got her once in the groin and one in the arm I think. He kind of went a little more hog-wild with her than with me. I faked dead... like that... I didn't want him to come back and give me some more.
""J.R. So you were pretty sure he thought you were dead when he finished working on you?

""B.H. I think he kind of thought that. Of course I don't know because we started talking right after he left. It's hard to say... (unintelligible)... I don't think she fainted either.
""J.R. Was she in a lot of pain, did she tell you?
""B.H. Oh yeah. She was more weak at the time... (unintelligible).. from the religious angle. I told her I sure as heck wasn't going to have any deathbed conversion. 'No,' she says... (unintelligible)... I mean it was just like you were gonna die and had a few things to say. But I felt more and more I wasn't losing strength as much... (unintelligible)... that I thought I could cope with...
""J.R. What you did was a courageous thing. It was a terrible thing to have happen to anyone.
""B.H. Well there was nothing we could do. We were kind of at the mercy of him. I mean I wanted to get that gun... (unintelligible)... There was a time I think I could have gotten it...
""J.R. Did it appear to be a .45 to you? An automatic?
""B.H. It was about this long... along the stock... and had a wood edge on it, you know.. on either side...
""J.R. Handles.
""B.H. Yeah...yeah...
""J.R. Did the bullet look anything like that?
""B.H. No. It was kind of like this, only it was gold, and this part here came out along with this and then round the gold, round the blunt end. Not quite that blunt-ended, though.
""J.R. Was it fat? Fatter than this?
""B.H. Yeah, I think it was a little fatter. But it was gold, you know. And I didn't see any of this here. There was a part where it crimped... Well, almost like that 22, short, only a lot bigger. It was about like this length, maybe more stubby.

""J.R. Well I'll get a .45 a little later and we can bring it up and let you observe it.
""B.H. ""Let's take the suspect. His hands... I don't remember if they had gloves on or not. I can't remember now. I keep thinking that he had gloves on. I can't figure how he tied us... Let's ask Celia, she probably knows about that.
""J.R. Did he swear? Did he use any profane language or obscenity?
""B.H. I don't think so. If he did it was no more than I was using at the time. I don't think he used any obscenity. He might have used a swear word or something, you know. That wasn't striking to me...
""J.R. Do you have any idea what his motive might have been? Money?
""B.H. Money. He said he was going to go to Mexico and he was flat broke.
""J.R. Did he search you after he...
""B.H. Heck no! Very unprofessional. He didn't even end up taking that loose change and didn't even take my billfold.
""J.R. Why did he stab you when you weren't fighting him off or anything?
""B.H. I couldn't. Even if I'd have wanted to. I was laying on my stomach...
""J.R. So what would have been the purpose of him to stab you, do you think?
""B.H. Well I (unintelligible)...but I think he got rattled... (unintelligible)... very, very nervous. His hands were shaking... (unintelligible)... Are you nervous?
""J.R. I'm just curious. If you could write me that symbol you were telling me about. Do you think you could draw me a picture of that even without your glasses?

The scene was being preserved by uniformed officers and under the direct control of Deputy Sheriffs David Collins and Ray Land. 
The investigating officers were briefed by Officers Collins and Land as to what had taken place prior to our arrival. Officers observed a 1956 white Kharman Ghia with a black vinyl top, Oregon license plate 4 U 2040. Investigating officers were shown footprints in dirt area and tire tracks, both believed to have been left by responsible. Investigating officers awaited the arrival of Sgt. Tom Butler who had been called to take photographs of the crime scene area and Sgt. Hal Snook, criminalist for collection and preservation of physical evidence. 
R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were advised by Park Ranger Dennis Land who had also arrived at the scene that it was possible to get to the beach area by vehicle from a locked gate approximately one-half mile south of the victim's vehicle. Officers proceeded to the area and arrived at the footpath approximately halfway between the scene of the crime at the beach and the victim's vehicle on the road. At that point, after a brief examination of the footpath area, officers discovered a similar footprint on the footpath to that found at the scene of the victim's vehicle. At that point, due to the lateness and darkness of the hour, Reporting Officers decided to completely secure the area and make a thorough search of the scene at first light. Officers then exited the crime scene area in the same manner and locked the aforementioned gate leading to this vicinity.

MR. BYRD advised that MISS JUDY was a student at the college and had left the college earlier in the afternoon, driving a yellow Datsun. At 2135 hours Reporting Officers put out an All Points Bulletin around the City and County of Napa for this above described vehicle. At 2137 hours Officers received permission to interview the victim BRYAN HARTNELL who was taken to the X-Ray Room for x-rays. Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Lonergan attempted to interview BRYAN HARTNELL while in the presence of DONALD JUDAH and hospital attendant CLIFFORD MEAGHER. Sgt. Narlow was called away to answer a phone before the interview got under way. HARTNELL appeared to be in extreme pain and also appeared to be in shock. Reporting Officer Lonergan introduced himself to HARTNELL and asked him to give us any information he had on his assailant. HARTNELL stated that the assailant was wearing a black ceremonial type hood, square on top, and appeared to be heavy-set, between 200 and 250 pounds. He also stated his assailant had approached both him and MISS SHEPARD with a gun but had stabbed them with a long knife. HARTNELL further stated the gun was in a black holster and the knife was in a sheath. He stated that the attacker was wearing dark clothing, dark jacket and dark pants. HARTNELL further stated that the gun was an automatic pistol and the knife had a black handle and appeared to be homemade.
It should be noted that HARTNELL was very groggy and he was very difficult to interview at that time. Subject was re-interviewed the next day by Det/Sgt. Robertson and gave more complete details. (The report of Sgt. Robertson's interview is attached.)
At 2215 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan left the Queen of the Valley Hospital after advising Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and William Munk to take charge of the clothing of the victims and any other evidence from the victims when it was released from the hospital. Munk and Brambrink were also advised to stand by at the hospital as a security measure until other arrangements could be made.
As Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan were arriving at the Napa County Sheriff's Office, they were advised by the Napa Police Department that they had located MISS JUDY in the downtown Napa area and were bringing her to the Napa County Sheriff's Office. MISS [JUDY] was interviewed by Lonergan and Narlow at the Napa County Sheriff's Office. She was further identified as MISS JUDITH, a student at Pacific Union College, with a permanent residence address of Sun Valley, California. MISS [JUDITH] advised that she was with BRYAN

HARTNELL and CECELIA SHEPARD earlier in the afternoon. She stated that they all left Pacific Union College together at approximately 1:00 P.M. and went to a rummage sale in the City of St. Helena. She stated that BRYAN had bought a T.V. set at the rummage sale and had to transport it back to his room at Pacific Union College. She stated he left CECELIA at the rummage sale as there was not enough room in his car. MISS [JUDITH] stated BRYAN returned to the St. Helena area and picked up CECELIA at approximately 2:00 P.M. MISS [JUDITH] stated as far as she knew, both BRYAN and CECELIA were planning to go to San Francisco when they left her in St. Helena. MISS [JUDITH] stated she had no knowledge of any plans that BRYAN and CECELIA were making to go to the Lake Berryessa area. MISS [JUDITH] stated the last time she saw BRYAN and CECELIA was approximately 2:00 P.M. in the afternoon.
The interview with MISS [JUDITH] was terminated at that point.
Det/Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow then proceeded to Lake Berryessa and arrived at the scene of the crime, which was approximately a mile and a half north of Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters, at 2354 hours. The scene was being preserved by uniformed officers and under the direct control of Deputy Sheriffs David Collins and Ray Land. The investigating officers were briefed by Officers Collins and Land as to what had taken place prior to our arrival.

took into his possession certain items belonging to the victims that were taken into evidence by Ranger Dennis Land. These items consisted of a blanket, a pair of man's shoes, a wallet belonging to BRYAN HARTNELL, eyeglasses, and playing cards. Among the various aforementioned items believed to belong to the victims, were numerous strands of white plastic line cut into various assorted lengths, some of which had what appeared to be bloodstains. These items were subsequently turned over to Det/Sgt. Hal Snook for preservation.
Assigned investigators then proceeded back to the scene where the victim's car was parked and assisted Sgt. Snook in the making of the plaster casts. At approximately 0245 hours Sgt. Lonergan, having previously obtained the keys to the vehicle from BRYAN HARTNELL's property at Queen of the Valley Hospital, drove the white Kharman Ghia to the maintenance shop at Berryessa Park Headquarters. The vehicle was parked inside of the maintenance shop building and the building was secured for the evening by investigating officers with the assistance of Park Ranger Dennis Land. Assigned Investigators then returned back to the scene where the victim's vehicle had been previously parked and awaited the arrival of Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and Mel Fechter who were assigned to security duty in the crime scene area. At approximately 0300 hours officers assumed their duties at the crime scene area and the security was placed under the direction of Deputy Allen Brambrink. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then returned to their respective residences with plans to continue the investigation at daybreak.
9/28/69 0700 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene at Lake Berryessa area, accompanied by Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Capt. Donald Townsend, and Sgt. James Munk. Officers then assisted Det/Sgt. Snook in tracking the footprints from the vehicle to the scene of the crime by the beach area. (The location and preservation of aforementioned footprints will be detailed in a supplementary evidence report by Sgt. Snook.)
At 0800 hours Reporting Officers Lonergan and Narlow received information via Park Headquarters that a DR. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his son would like to talk to them at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop regarding a possible suspect in this crime. At 0912 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan contacted DR. R. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his 16-yr. old son DAVID LEE RAYFIELD at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop. DR. RAYFIELD gave a home address of Los Gatos, California. DR. RAYFIELD stated that about 6:30 P.M. the previous evening he and his son had parked their car north of Park Headquarters in the general area of the

crime scene. They stated they went down towards the beach area when DAVID RAYFIELD noticed a white male adult subject walking in the area, described as about 5'10"", heavy build, wearing dark trousers, a dark shirt with red in it, long sleeves. He stated this subject was carrying nothing in his hands and was apparently just walking alongside the hill area about halfway between the road and the lake. DAVID further stated that when the subject observed him he turned around and walked up the hill in a southerly direction. DR. RAYFIELD and his son stated that they did not notice a vehicle in the area of their vehicle and only this subject at a distance of about 100 yards. They also advised there was a man with two young boys in the area shooting B-B guns, but they did not know if this man saw the subject or not. This location was approximately 8/10ths of a mile from the scene of the victim's vehicle. In the opinion of R/Os, it is unlikely, unless this male subject had a vehicle in the immediate area, he could have traversed the area to the scene of the crime on foot. There are four coves of water between the scene of the crime and the area where the doctor saw the subject. The interview with DR. RAYFIELD and his son was terminated at that point.
At 1000 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene of the crime and further assisted Sgt. Snook in the collecting and locating of evidence.
At 1320 hours 9/28/69, R/Os interviewed Ranger Sgt. William White at Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters. White was interviewed as to his activities before and during his part in locating the victims the night before. White stated at approximately 1855 hours 9/27/69 he was on routine patrol around the Lake Berryessa area when he received a call from Park Headquarters to proceed to the Rancho Monticello Resort where a person was reporting a possible stabbing. 
White stated he proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort where he was contacted by ARCHIE E. WHITE, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG. RONALD FONG advised him that he had seen a male and a female victim on the beach area south of Rancho Monticello Resort, hollering that they had been stabbed. Ranger Sgt. White, accompanied by ARCHIE WHITE, ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the beach area via speedboat owned by ARCHIE WHITE. When they arrived on the beach they observed a young female lying on the ground with what appeared to be numerous stab wounds. Ranger Sgt. White stated that the female appeared to be in a great deal of pain. White stated as they discovered the female victim, Ranger Dennis Land arrived at the scene in his pickup truck, carrying a male victim who also appeared to have numerous stab wounds. White stated he immediately radioed in and had Park Headquarters call the Sheriff's Office to dispatch an ambulance and a Deputy. White stated he attempted to interview both the boy and girl victims while awaiting

arrival of the ambulance. According to White, the male victim said that a male subject approached them, wearing a hood, dressed in dark clothing. The subject was carrying what appeared to be an automatic pistol and stated that he wanted their money and car keys. According to White, the male victim related to him that the subject advised him he was an ex-con out of Colorado and was en route to Mexico. Suspect stated he had to tie them up, and after they were tied the responsible stated, ""I'm going to have to stab you."" White further related that the male victim advised the responsible, ""Stab me first, I can't stand to see her stabbed first."" The male victim then advised that the responsible stabbed him numerous times in the back and then stabbed the girl.
The female victim advised White that she could not see the responsible's face as a hood was covering all of his head. She also advised White that the suspect had what appeared to be clip-on sunglasses to cover his eyes. Ranger Sgt. White stated that this is the most he could get out of either victim as they were both in great shock and pain. White stated that he noticed a lot of blood near the girl's groin area. The interview with Ranger Sgt. White was terminated at that point.
9/28/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort and interviewed MR. ARCHIE E. WHITE. (It should be noted that ARCHIE E. WHITE and ELIZABETH WHITE are no relation to Ranger Sgt. White.) ARCHIE E. WHITE is the owner of the Boat Repair Shop at Rancho Monticello Resort. He lives at the Resort. Also interviewed were MR. WHITE's wife, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE. MR. and MRS. WHITE advised that they were contacted by RONALD FONG who advised them he had just observed what appeared to be a male and a female subject lying on the beach south of the Rancho Monticello Resort, covered with blood. FONG advised them that the couple had shouted out to him that they had been stabbed and robbed. MRS. WHITE immediately called Park Headquarters and Ranger Sgt. William White arrived at the Resort a short time later. MR. and MRS. WHITE, accompanied by Ranger Sgt. Bill White and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the scene area in one of MR. WHITE's ski boats. When they arrived on the scene, they observed a young female wearing a sweater dress lying on the beach, covered with blood. When they approached the area she was on her elbows and knees, rocking back and forth as if in great pain. MRS. WHITE stated she immediately attempted to make the victim more comfortable and tried to calm her down until the ambulance arrived. MRS. WHITE stated the girl advised him, ""He was a man with a hood... His face was covered... He was wearing black pants... It hurts, it

hurts."" MRS. WHITE then advised after the female had regained her composure, she told her the man had asked for money but didn't take any. She said she hadn't been raped. MRS. WHITE further advised that the female victim told her that the responsible was wearing glasses, with dark clip-on sunglasses over the hood. She told her that the responsible had a black pistol. MR. ARCHIE WHITE stated he overheard the male victim advise someone that the responsible was wearing gloves. MR. and MRS. WHITE further advised that this is the only information either victim gave them on the responsible, and that they spent the balance of the time attempting to make the victim more comfortable until the arrival of the ambulance.
After the interview with MR. and MRS. WHITE, Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan returned to the Napa County Sheriff's Office.
At 1620 hours R/O Det/Sgt. Narlow was contacted by a DEAN of the Pacific Union College in Angwin. DEAN advised that three young ladies, students at the college, might possibly have information as to a suspect in the attack at Lake Berryessa. The young ladies were identified as MISS JOANNE, MISS LINDA, and MISS LINDA. DEAN advised that these girls had been in the Lake Berryessa area from about 3:00 P.M. to 4:30 P.M. the previous Saturday afternoon. They had observed a male subject in a late model, silver blue Chevrolet, two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. DEAN advised that the girls had told him they were observed out of the car by this subject while they were sunbathing on the beach. They described the subject as approximately 40 years old, [blank] feet tall, dressed in dark clothing. Sgt. Narlow dispatched Deputy Sheriff Raymond Land to interview these three girls that evening. (The report of Land's interview is attached.)
Reporting Officers spent the balance of the day and evening going through their investigative notes and issuing a statewide All Points Bulletin.
Monday, 9/29/69 Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan spent the majority of the morning interviewing numerous citizens and officers from other departments regarding this crime and similar crimes. (A general list of possible suspects was begun and they are noted on separate incident reports as to origin of information and description of suspects, attached.)
Reporting Officers were advised by Deputy Sheriff Ray Land who interviewed the three college girls, MISS [JOANNE], MISS [LINDA], and MISS [LINDA] that the information appeared to have some merit and advised that the three young ladies would be in the office in the afternoon for further interview.

9/29/69 1445 hours The three young ladies came into the office and were interviewed by Sgt. Lonergan, Sgt. Snook, and Capt. Donald Townsend.
Lonergan interviewed a MISS JOANNE MARIE, who, [age] years of age, DOB [blank], her address at the college is 114 Dauphine, Pacific Union College, home address South East 12th, College Place, Washington. MISS [JOANNE] advised R/O that on 9/27/69 at approximately 5:30 P.M. she and her two girlfriends parked their vehicle at a location two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. When they left their car they noticed a subject driving a late model silver blue Chevrolet, 2-door sedan, pull up behind them. What appeared to be a white male adult was sitting in the vehicle. They did not observe this subject leave the vehicle. The girls proceeded to the beach area and were sunbathing in their bikinis. After approximately one-half hour had passed, they observed what appeared to be the same subject standing within 40 or 50 feet of them, apparently observing them. This subject was described as 6' tall, weighing 200/210 lbs., muscular build, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing dark pants and a dark pullover shirt. The subject would stare at the three girls but when they looked up at him he would look away. The subject hung around the area for approximately 45 minutes and then the girls observed him walk up the hill. MISS [JOANNE] stated it was very doubtful that from his vantage point in the vehicle the subject could observe the three girls on the beach. She believes he waited in his vehicle and then followed them down after they were on the beach. MISS [JOANNE] further described the car as appearing very conservative. She stated the car did not appear to belong to any young person such as a teenager. She did state the car had California license plates but did not notice the number.
The other two young ladies, MISS [LINDA] and MISS [LINDA] were interviewed by Sgt. Snook and Capt. Donald Townsend.
MISS LINDA who was interviewed by R/O Det/Sgt. Snook, is a WFA, DOB [blank], home address Sunnyside Road, Sanitarium. She stated she left the Angwin area with two other girls, JOANNE and LINDA at approximately 2:45 P.M. 9/27/69. The girls drove through Pope Valley to Lake Berryessa where they parked their vehicle two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand. MISS [LINDA] stated she observed a subject go into the parking lot area to the south. Subject went past their vehicle and backed up so their rear bumpers were nearly touching. Vehicle described as a 1966 or 1967 light blue Chevrolet with California plates. Witness believes the vehicle was a 2-door sedan and described the headlights as being long rather than round. The rear window glass was tinted quite dark. Another vehicle from Angwin with Arizona plates was in the parking area and witness saw the occupants, a MISS DENISE BROWN and a MR. WAYNE HAIGHT.

to the beach and shortly thereafter noticed the male subject watching them from the edge of the trees. After about 30 minutes the subject came down by the beach and passed within 20 feet of witness as he walked from south to north. Subject was described by MISS [LINDA] as approximately 28 years of age, 6' to 6'2"" tall, 200/225 lbs., black hair possibly styled, with a part on left, rounded eyes, thin lips, medium nose, straight eyebrows, small ears, well built, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing a black short-sleeved sweater shirt, bunched up in front, and a white tee shirt hanging out in back, and dark trousers. The three girls left the area about 4:30 P.M. and the subject's vehicle was gone. Witnesses did not observe the subject either leave or get back into his vehicle.
MISS LINDA LEE was interviewed by R/O Capt. Donald Townsend. MISS [LINDA LEE] is a WFA, DOB [blank], address Howell Mountain Road, Angwin. MISS [LINDA LEE] is employed as a secretary of the college press. MISS [LINDA LEE] observed the same vehicle which was described as a late model Chevrolet, sky blue in color. The rear tail lights appeared to be long rather than round. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated they parked their vehicle at approximately 2:55 P.M. and observed the subject in his vehicle at that location. The girls proceeded to the beach and she, MISS [LINDA LEE], again noticed the subject about 30 to 45 minutes after they were at the beach. She noticed him standing on the bank approximately 45 yards from her location. She described the subject as 6 feet tall, stocky build, about 200 lbs., black short-sleeved sweater shirt, dark blue slacks, and straight dark hair neatly combed. She guessed his age at approximately 30 years. Subject had medium color skin and was not wearing glasses. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated she thought she saw a white belt around his back but it possibly was a tee shirt hanging out. She further stated that the man was fairly nice-looking, with a round face. She did not observe the subject leave the area in his vehicle.
9/29/69 - 1600 hours Reporting Officers Sgt. Narlow and Sgt. Lonergan were advised by Capt. Joseph Page that the female victim, MISS CECELIA SHEPARD, had just died at Queen of the Valley Hospital.

Page further advised R/Os that the remains would be removed to Morrison Funeral Home where DR. DE PETRIS would complete the autopsy.
At 1945 hours 9/29/69, R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were contacted by Probation Officer H. B. Schotte. Mr. Schotte had observed the footprint design that R/Os had taken at the scene and stated he had knowledge of a possible similar shoe sole design. Mr. Schotte brought into the office a MR.

Air Force Base and is a Flight Line Mechanic. He is a retired Master Sergeant in the United States Air Force. MR. [BASSEL] showed R/O a pair of Air Force chukker boots that belonged to him. He described these boots as being Government issue, issued to all Air Force personnel at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. They are primarily designed as a wing-walker shoe, however according to MR. [BASSEL] most Air Force personnel and many of the civilian personnel employed at Air Force bases had this type of shoe. The sole design of this shoe exactly matched the plaster cast design that Sgt. Snook had taken at the scene of the crime. It should be noted that Det/Sgt John Robertson had attempted to find a similar shoe design at the local shoe stores in the Napa area with negative results. (Refer Sgt. Robertson's supplementary report.) MR. [BASSEL] was asked if we could keep his shoes for identification purposes and he agreed. R/Os was also advised that this information regarding the type of footprint had not been released to the press or general public. MR. [BASSEL] stated he would cooperate with R/Os and keep this information confidential.
9/30/69, 0810 hours R/O Sgt. Lonergan received a telephone call from MISS MARILYN DENISE, 18 years of age, DOB [blank].

Saturday, 9/27/69 she was in the Lake Berryessa area with a male companion, MR. JOHN, 22 years of age, also a student at Pacific Union College. She stated at this time they were parked on the Knoxville Road approximately one mile south of the Lake Berryessa Marina. She stated shortly after they parked the vehicle they observed the victims who were known to them, BRYAN HARTNELL and CECELIA SHEPARD, driving south on Knoxville Road in BRYAN's white Kharman Ghia. She stated as the HARTNELL vehicle drove by, BRYAN waved out the window and said, ""Hi, John!"", referring to MR. [JOHN]. MISS [MARILYN] stated that they did not see the HARTNELL vehicle any other time that day.
9/30/69, 0900 hours R/Os Det/Sgt. Narlow and Det/Sgt. Richard Lonergan, accompanied by Sgt. Thomas Butler, proceeded to the Morrison Funeral Home in St. Helena.

advised that the cause of death was shock and loss of blood brought on by two main stab wounds.
9/30/69, 1430 hours R/O Det/Sgt. Kenneth Narlow contacted CAPT. at Travis Air Force Base and arranged for an interview with COL. and SGT. to take place on Wednesday morning, October 1st, 1969, at 9:00 A.M. R/Os wanted to talk to someone at Travis regarding the shoeprints that were found on the scene. The remainder of the day and evening was spent in answering phone calls from people who had possible knowledge of the crime.
Wednesday, 10/1/69 - 0900 hours Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow went to Travis Air Force Base and were present at an interview in Col. office, who is Commanding Officer in charge of base security. Also present at this meeting besides the aforementioned officers was LT. COL. of the Office of Special Investigation. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan advised the Air Force personnel present of the portion of the evidence we had discovered at the crime scene and asked them for assistance in locating where this type of shoe was sold or issued. LT. COL. advised that his office would assist assigned investigators in attempting to locate the source of the shoe.
Officers were directed to the Base Supply with the assistance of Special Agent DONALD of O.S.I., at which time it was determined through Base Supply that this shoe in question was of Government issue and that it was not kept in stock at Base Supply, however it was believed that the Sales Store had such an item. It was then explained that if a military person or civilian employee was determined to be in need of such an item, he first reported to the Base Supply, at which time he was issued a purchase requisition which he in turn took to the Sales Store and the type of shoe was issued to the individual and they in turn required the individual to sign the purchase requisition showing that he did receive the item. This purchase requisition states the type of shoe that the individual was to receive, however makes no reference as to size.
Assigned investigators, accompanied by Special Agent proceeded to the Sales Store located on Travis Air Force Base. After a short period of time R/Os located in stock a shoe fitting the identical description of the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast which officers had in their possession. The identical shoe with identical tread was found and a shoe bearing the closest measurements in the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast was measured and found to be a size 10 1/2 in military styling or a 10 1/2 D in civilian equivalent. It was determined through Air Force records that they were unable to furnish officers with the

data regarding the sales of this type shoe due to the fact that no recordings were made of the specific sizes, however purchase records indicate over the past 13 months approximately 100 pairs of this size shoe, namely 10 1/2, had been purchased and disposed of through sales. Air Force records indicate this type shoe is manufactured by the International Shoe Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, then shipped to Air Force Depot, Ogden, Utah, and from there shipped to the various military installations upon requisition orders.
10/1/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then proceeded to the Vallejo Police Department and met with Sgt. Jack Mullanax and Sgt. Duane Nilsson. Officers exchanged information regarding Vallejo's crime of 7/4/69 and our particular incident. Suspect information was exchanged and is listed in the separate suspect file.
Investigating Officers checked to determine the validity of the decoded message and as to how far the original cyphers had been decoded. It was then learned that the message had been decoded by at least two different sources, one being by MR. and MRS. HARDIN of Salinas and the other by the FBI in Washington. It was noted that these cyphers were broken independent of one another and the FBI confirmed the validity of the original decoded message. It was also learned that there was a small portion on the very end of the coded message that had not been decoded for reasons unknown.
The balance of the afternoon and evening Reporting Officers and other investigating officers met to exchange information and further discuss the evidence at hand.
Thursday, October 2nd, 1969, 0845 hours Reporting Officer Lonergan received a telephone call from Special Agent, OSI, Travis Air Force Base. Subject called to report that approximately 500 to 1,000 of that type of wing-walker shoe have been sold as surplus on the Base. This would be over and above those sold at the Sales Store. Agent further related he has the names of all the subjects who have purchased this item through surplus and will keep these names available to officers upon request.
The balance of the morning was spent searching fingerprint evidence and answering phone calls from possible witnesses.
Thursday, 10/2/69, 1400 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan attended the funeral services for victim CECELIA SHEPARD. These services were held at the Pacific Union College Church, Angwin, California. Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan positioned themselves

inside the church in order to observe all persons who viewed the services and the remains of victim CECELIA SHEPARD. Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Sgt. Thomas Butler, and Detective Ronald Montgomery of the Napa Police Department positioned themselves outside the church and photographed all persons entering and leaving the services. This included individual photographs and group scenes. Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow also attended the graveside services at the St. Helena Cemetery in St. Helena.
Friday, 10/3/69 - Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Richard Lonergan contacted JAMES, Napa State Hospital, advised him to set up an interview with a patient who is a possible suspect in our case. The patient is identified as GRIFFIN RAYMOND FRANKLIN, WMA, 20 yrs. of age, DOB [blank], 6'2"", 223 lbs. [JAMES] had previously reported that this subject had left the hospital on a pass Friday evening, 9/26/69, and returned to the hospital Monday afternoon, 9/29/69. This subject also had spent time in the Air Force and was discharged from the Air Force in January 1969 for psychiatric problems. According to the doctors at the hospital, this subject was capable of committing this type of a crime. R/O in the presence of JAMES and Security Officer PHIL RYAN interviewed subject FRANKLIN. FRANKLIN was very cooperative and talkative to R/O and went over his activities the prior weekend. Briefly stated, MR. FRANKLIN, whose parents live in Vallejo, never left the Vallejo area that weekend and stayed around home talking with his mother, stepfather, and three brothers. After interviewing subject, it was the opinion of R/O Sgt. Lonergan that this subject was not the responsible. He had a definite very fast manner of speaking which was completely opposed to the victim's statement concerning the suspect's voice. R/O also contacted the mother of the suspect, a MRS. OPAL at Hollywood Avenue, Vallejo. MRS. OPAL stated more or less the exact same thing that her son had stated as to his whereabouts that weekend. It appears that this subject has a reliable alibi as to his activities and had no access to a vehicle that weekend. This subject was cleared as far as this crime is concerned.
The balance of the morning and afternoon was spent by R/Os Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan going over physical evidence and dictating reports.

9/28/69 12:30 P.M. Reporting Officer John Robertson, Det/Sgt., interviewed one of two victims who were each stabbed numerous times by an unknown assailant. Victim CECELIA SHEPARD and victim BRYAN HARTNELL both had been placed in the Queen of the Valley Hospital intensive care unit. Victim SHEPARD had surgery performed on her earlier in the morning (9/28/69) and was unable to be questioned by the Reporting Officer, however Dr. Ludwig gave permission for victim HARTNELL to be interviewed.
Although victim HARTNELL was heavily sedated, he was able to give R/O a verbal statement. (Note: R/O taped electrically the interview with victim HARTNELL.) Victim HARTNELL related the following.
He had known CECELIA SHEPARD for some time, they were good friends, and she had come to the Napa County area to spend the weekend. She and a female companion, DALORA LEE, Aspen, Loma Linda, San Bernardino County, Calif. (phone Ext. 2155) had driven from Southern California and were to drive back Sunday, 9/28/69. Victim stated he and MISS SHEPARD drove to Lake Berryessa, picked a large tree near the shore line where they decided to lie down and enjoy the scenery. While lying on the ground, victim HARTNELL stated he heard a noise and asked MISS SHEPARD if she could hear anything or see anything behind a tree not far from where the couple were lying. MISS SHEPARD told victim HARTNELL she could see a man behind the tree. HARTNELL asked her what he was doing. MISS SHEPARD stated she couldn't tell. HARTNELL stated he (suspect) then came from behind the tree. MISS SHEPARD said, ""Oh my God, he has a gun!""
Victim HARTNELL stated the man approached the couple, aiming a black steel automatic pistol. The suspect stated he needed a car and money. Suspect stated his car was ""hot"" and he wanted victim HARTNELL's car keys. Victim HARTNELL stated he began talking with the suspect, telling the suspect he had no money, only a small amount of change, also that if the suspect was really in need of assistance HARTNELL would attempt to help him. The suspect told victim to get on the ground. Suspect then had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him. HARTNELL stated he attempted to keep the suspect engaged in conversation while suspect was tying the victims.
HARTNELL further stated the suspect was described as follows: Wearing a black hooded mask (cloth), covering suspect's entire head and shoulders, coming down almost to suspect's waist. Victim stated on front of the four-cornered type mask (similar to paper bag in style) there was a symbol, the symbol described as white, approximately 3 x 3 inches in diameter, with a symmetrical cross. Also on the eyelets of the mask was a pair of clip-on sunglasses, the glasses clipped to the eyelets. Victim stated he could also see hair through the mask's eyelets and observed the hair to be dark brown.
Victim stated suspect was wearing a light-weight windbreaker, dark blue or black, pleated slacks (old-fashioned type). Victim could not remember what type of shoes or anything about suspect's hands, could not remember if suspect was wearing gloves.
Victim thought suspect was possibly 20 to 30 years of age by voice concept. Victim stated suspect was 5'8"" to 6', 225-250 lbs., dark brown hair, eyes unknown, sloppy dresser, stomach hanging over trousers. Suspect spoke with some

type of drawl, but victim stated it was not a Southern drawl, did not really know what type of drawl, but thought the man was not well educated, but did not feel he was illiterate either. Victim said suspect's voice was moderate in sound, that is, not high or low pitched.
Suspect told victim he was sent to (?) Lodge State Prison (possibly Deer Lodge State Prison), Montana, for a killing. While there (in prison) he killed a guard while escaping. Suspect also told victims he was heading for Mexico, told victim he was flat broke.
Victim observed cut-up rope in suspect's rear pocket (trouser's), also stated he was wearing a knife in a case (on belt) on his right side, near front of trousers. Knife description: Appeared to be a long bread knife, 12"" long blade, 3/4"" wide, hardwood handle, 2 brass rivets holding handle in place, cotton surgical tape wrapped approximately 1"" around handle of knife. Knife case possibly made of wood.
Victim asked suspect if suspect's gun was loaded. Suspect removed magazine from handle of pistol and showed victim a bullet removed from gun, bullet described as a possible .45 caliber. Victim did not know what caliber the pistol was.
Suspect had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him, suspect then tied victim SHEPARD's hands, then re-tied HARTNELL's hands, then tied both victims' ankles together, had victims lie on their stomachs. HARTNELL stated suspect said, ""I'm getting nervous."" This was when suspect was tying MISS SHEPARD'S hands, in fact HARTNELL stated suspect got real shaky when he was tying MISS SHEPARD's hands.
Victim HARTNELL then stated that without warning the suspect plunged his knife into the back of HARTNELL. Suspect did this repeatedly, HARTNELL stated he thinks six times. HARTNELL stated he pretended to be dead and the suspect went over to MISS SHEPARD and stabbed MISS SHEPARD repeatedly in the back, and when MISS SHEPARD turned her body over (on back), suspect stabbed her in the lower abdomen. Victim stated suspect stabbed MISS SHEPARD much worse than him. Suspect went into some sort of frenzy when stabbing MISS SHEPARD.
Victim HARTNELL stated suspect left the area after the stabbing. Victim HARTNELL hailed a boat (off shore) and told the man in the boat the couple needed help badly. Victim stated the boat left the area and he (victim) attempted to get help by crawling and walking to the road. (Victim believed he had walked to the road, however had not gone too far from his wounded companion.)
Victim stated he thought suspect had been with the couple for approximately fifteen (15) minutes from time of observing suspect until suspect departed. Victim stated suspect did not take his wallet, although when MISS SHEPARD was tying victim HARTNELL's hands, she reached in his pocket and threw his wallet to suspect. Suspect did not take the wallet or victim's car keys.
Victim stated a man in a pickup truck found him on the road and called an ambulance. Victim stated he estimated one hour in time was involved between the time he and MISS SHEPARD were stabbed until help arrived.
MISS SHEPARD is listed in critical condition.

Sgt. ROBERTSON stated that Mr. HARTNELL was heavily sedated but was able to give a verbal statement pertaining to the attack at Lake Berrysessa. The interview was taped and reads as follows:
""INTERVIEW OF JOHN ROBERTSON, DET/SGT., NAPA COUNTY SHERIFF's DEPARTMENT, WITH BRYAN CALVIN HARTNELL (NSO CASE #105907) AT QUEEN OF THE VALLEY HOSPITAL ON SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1969 (TRANSCRIBED FROM TAPE RECORDING BY M. FEURLE):
""J.R. Can you give me this fellow's description and tell me what happened?
""B.H. So many people have been asking me... I hope...
""J.R. Well sometimes when we're repetitious, I know it happens to me, I tell the same thing over and over and over, and sometimes I might vary a little, and if you do...
""B.H. Shall I just start out and tell you what happened?
""J.R. I don't want to tire you out.
""B.H. I just don't want this to happen again to anybody... Of course he might have his reasons, I don't know...
""J.R. Okay. Go right ahead. Start right from the beginning. What happened?
""B.H. Okay. This girl came out from school, I used to go with her two years ago, and she's now going to another school, and she came up to visit some friends and we were having dinner at the school cafeteria, and I said, 'Well, are you doing anything special this afternoon?' and she said, 'Why?', and I said, 'I don't know. We could go out and either go for a walk, go to San Francisco, or, you know, just...', 'cause we used to be good friends. We used to have a good friendship. And so it got too late by the time we got around to what we were going to do. We had to stop in St. Helena for a couple items and then we had to cart a couple kids home and stuff, and by the time we finally got around to it, it was getting late, and I thought going to San Francisco 'd rush you, you know, because by the time we got back for worship... And so we went out to Berryessa, and there was this one place I used to go out... we used to all the time, you know... and I couldn't find it. And so I figured Ah, forget it, and this looks like as good a place as any. So I parked the car, there were no other cars there. I had a Kharman Ghia, '56, white, with a black vinyl top, and it's in pretty

... ""good-looking shape. But we parked there on the road's edge and we talked Oh it must be about a quarter of a mile to down to the place where we went. We had... (unintelligible) peninsula, it's an an island I guess during the wetter season, You can see where it was levee... And so that looked like a lot... there was a big spreading tree up there. There were two of them, really, one was a little bigger than the other. We took the one that was out on the point.
""It was really beautiful out there. We were sitting on top... I lay down on my back and she lay down on her stomach beside me, you know, kind of resting her head on my shoulder, and we were talking, you know, kind of reminiscing about old times, and stuff. And I heard these rustling leaves, and I said, 'You have your specs on. Why don't you see what the deal is over there?' And she says, 'Oh, it's some man.' And I said, 'Is he alone?' and she said, 'Yeah... (unintelligible)...' and she says, 'Well he just stepped behind the tree.' And I said, 'What's the idea of that? To take a leak?' You know, 'cause that's the only thing I could think of, just step behind a tree. And so I says, 'Well, keep looking and tell me what happens,' and she says, 'Oh my God, he's got a gun!' and squeezed my arm and
""And so he came out, and of course still actually I wasn't... There's some things you really wouldn't mind having happen, just for the experience of it. You know I thought, Well I only got fifty cents on me. It's worth all of that having it happen. I didn't think about another angle. So I talked to him, you know. I said, 'Well listen, Mac, (you know I'm in the sociologist field, you know, I'm pre-law, with history and psych.) You know I've read about the criminal mind and everything, you know. I thought well maybe the guy really does need help, you know. I says, 'There's no strings attached.' I says, 'I don't have any money right now but if you need help that badly I can help you out in another way maybe.' And he says, 'Nah.. time's running short,' he says, ''cause I just got out of... some prison in Montana, I don't know what the name of it is. Feathers? Do you know what the name of it is? I'll see if it sounds familiar. Fern or Feathers? It's some double name, like Fern Lock or something...
""J.R. It's Lodge..

Case INV 1-15-311-F9-5861
""B.H. Oh yeah, yeah, Lodge. At least we know we're together on that.
""J.R. Mountain Lodge Prison, or something of that nature...
""B.H. Yeah. You know he said he broke out and had to kill a guard getting out. And I said, 'Well, man, I mean actually I don't mean to call your bluff or anything, but wouldn't you rather be stuck on a stealing charge than a threat of homicide?' you know? And he says, 'Well just don't start playing hero on me.' You know, 'Don't try to grab the gun,' 'cause I didn't really figure the gun was loaded. I always thought it would be empty. I've heard a lot of times that this is what they do just as a bluff, but I decided not to call his bluff after he really, you know... I told him, 'You know you're really wasting your time with me. I've got a billfold and this much change and that's it.' And he said, he told the girl, 'Go tie him up. I'd feel much better if you were tied up.' And she tied a couple of loose knots on me, so I made it look kind of tight... (unintelligible)... you know, just for a second, and he said 'Go ahead.' And I whispered to her, 'You know I think I can get that gun.' And I said, 'Do you mind?' and she got kind of fearful about it, so I figured since there's two lives involved, not just mine, I won't do it.
""So I let her tie me up on the wrists again, and he tied her up, - terribly tight, you know, real... (unintelligible) ... put his gun away, and we were talking and all, bantering, you know, basically. I was thinking, anything I can do to help, by the way just to keep the conversation going... Suddenly he was taking it all seriously, you know... So I was starting out and finally he said, 'Okay, lay down. I've got her tied up', you know... He strung a rope between our ankles in the rear, so we were like this, you know, on our stomachs, tied...
""J.R. You both facing the ground...
""B.H. Right. And, oh, this was before. I got sort of ahead. So anyway, he said, 'Get down,' and I said, 'Oh come on! We could freeze to death!' I said that a couple, three times, and he said, 'GET DOWN! RIGHT NOW!' He got a little pushed off at me. So I got down and then he finished tying her up and clonked her down, - and then he goes... Sswhooosh (a sound with his mouth)... (unintelligible)

""And so I said, 'Do you have bullets in there?' And so he pulled out the clip and showed me that he did. The bullets were about this long, I can remember, and about this fat, and they had the regular red cap on it, about this long. Maybe that doesn't give you any better description of the gun or not. I don't know. And it came out of the heel, the grip, you know. It slipped out from the bottom.
""And now, to backtrack a bit. I was really trying to see what he looked like, you know. He had on pleated pants, these old type of suit pants, you know, and they were either black or dark blue, I can't remember now. And I can't remember what he was wearing for shoes. But he had on this cotton coat, You've seen the kind, that you just turn the collar up once, there's a zipper down the front, you know. They're real light, super-thin, you know...
""J.R. Kind of a windbreaker...
""B.H. Yeah, like a windbreaker. And it's got this blue, this little collar, sometimes the guys wear them standing up, you know.
""J.R. What color was that?
""B.H. That was dark blue. And I don't know. Maybe he had something in his pouch. I just took it as being a... as being a... you know, he was stout 'cause he looked kind of heavy. I think he was weighing two and a quarter, two fifty, somewhere in there. And I got kind of a look at his hair. His voice... I can remember... almost like I'd heard it before. You know there's some drawls that a lot of people have similar. And... almost as if I'd heard it before... couldn't think where.
""I gave that one up, I just gave it up on that angle. I looked through his hair. I kind of looked like it was combed, you know, like this.. it was a brownish, you know, dark brown hair.
""And this mask he had on. It was ingeniously devised. It was... he had four corners at the top, like the top of a paper sack... black. It came down, came down, with the front panel about to here, and a kind of a thing that came over the shoulders, you know, and then the same thing down the back, straight down. And in the front he had a circle with a symmetrical cross in the middle. You know what I mean by a symmetrical cross?

Case INV 1-15-311-F9-5861
""J.R. Um hum (affirmative).
""B.H. The ends of the cross hung out about this far on each of the... you know, where it came out. The circle was this much... like this... and then it was like this, you see... hung out on the end, over the edge of the circle.
""And he had clip-on sunglasses... it was hard to tell. You know, the sunglasses you clip on when you're wearing glasses, eyeglasses, He had those clipped on. I'm pretty sure... I don't think he had glasses, though. I think he just had these clipped on to his suit... you know, that little mask.
""And I don't know how tall he was. Maybe 5-8 or maybe 5-10, 6 feet, somewhere in there. I'm a very poor judge of height because of my height. I have no meaning, you know. It's always down, you know. It can never be up...
""And so I saw him put away his gun, and I was turning to say something to Celia, and all of a sudden I felt my back... just... no, I think I saw him pull it out.. I don't remember... I think I saw him whip out his knife and just start stabbing me in the back... CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP! I was just (makes a gutteral sound)... you know that kind of a sound... and Celia turned to see why I was (repeats gutteral sound), you know, and she just about fainted. She went hysterical... (unintelligible) ... and when he finally stopped... I mean he went over and... The doctor says there's six in the back, six wounds on my back. You ought to confirm that. One I've got went clear through the lung. I've got it draining. I did drain a couple pints of blood out as soon as I got here. I lost an awful lot of blood, I guess.
""We were down... I mean it was absolutely no question in my mind... when a person gets stabbed as many times as we did... we were going to die. I mean there'd be no reason to question it. But somehow I, you know, started (unintelligible)... I just knew there was too much I had to live for. I mean really it does happen... about getting depressed and everything... when you're young you always think about these things... you know you think about it... and when you've got someone forcing your hand, oh well, there was a lot of things I had to do. And what really kept me going... you know my parents are pretty Christian. I haven't been too much of a Christian myself... but if you believe in the principle you ask God to help you. Another thing, What was my only strength was knowing two things. One, that I did not want to die, and two, that I felt that whatever was

""going to be was going to be, but I was going to try my damnedest to stay alive. And so, like I say, - before I left her I kissed her, and I said, 'Well,' I says, 'I'm gonna try to get help.'
""There was a boat kept circling around out there in the lake and we started yelling at it and finally it came within about 100 yards of the shore and turned off its motor and stayed there watching us for about fifteen minutes, and we were just screaming hysterically, trying to get their attention, you know, to come over here. Oh, I don't know, I guess they were afraid that the guy might be there in the bushes and they were liable to get choked or something. So finally he came up a little closer. I didn't have my glasses on... I was just swaying, you know... and I had gotten one of her hands free before they came, and so I kept trying to get her to untie me, and she couldn't, she was too weak, she said.
""So finally I just kept hollering and hollering, and she said, 'Turn around and let's see if I can do it again.' She finally got it. My hands and my feet were just pure numbness... they're still numb but I'm sure that will go 'way. But I finally got... (unintelligible)... untie her so she could kind of relax out. 'Cause it was a terrible position, you know, upon our stomachs... (unintelligible)...
""And so I started to go for help. I finally got myself fairly reconciled. I wasn't too worried about dying, if that was what was going to happen, but I knew I had to keep pushing on. I had to force myself into staying alive because it was... I could just see myself... you know, all sort of waves would come over... I just (coughing sound)... (unintelligible)... 'Well, you're not gonna give up this easy', you know. And, like I say, I just kept believing that God would do everything the best, if the thing was gonna happen, but I couldn't see any reason why my dying would be the best good. So I just played along with that.
""I just started to walk toward the road... everything blacked out on me... my visual... my mind was never blacked out, but my visual was. So I lay down... My eyes started to come open... I just saw a haze of trees, you know. In a little while I got up and went another twenty feet, and then the same thing happened... (unintelligible)... and sat down. Next thing I went clear... (unintelligible)... the road, and by that time I just fell... I just... I was trying so hard to go far I just went too far. Finally I heard this pickup

""coming... I was just laying alongside the road, and that's where this guy picked me up.
""They weren't in any hurry at all, it didn't seem like, you know, but they finally called an ambulance. About fifteen minutes later it came... (unintelligible)... but I still believe... I've got feeling... starting to get a little pain to come through. But from the minute that knife blade went in, it was nothing but pure shock from there on. I just did not expect it. I didn't expect that he would do that. That was a variable I had completely left out. And I guess he just took off running after we started running. I don't know. I never saw him before and hope not to see him again... at least outside of a courtroom.
""It's hard for me to explain much more. I mean I'm trying to give you a kind of example of his technique. He had some rope cut up in his back pocket. And he had a ... well, I thought it was a police automatic because it was in one of these black leather cases, you know...
""J.R. Was it in a smooth case, or did it have a basket weave like..
""B.H. Can I have my glasses? Oh, they're not here. It was a smooth one, though.
""J.R. Did he have this hood down to about the middle of his chest?
""B.H. No, about like... well, I'll show you... Here... his stomach.. You know I could see his... (voice fades away)
""J.R. Okay. You said his hair looked dark brown. How could you see his hair?
""B.H. 'Cause I saw it from where those goggles fit. I looked so closely to find out. And when he turned you know they kind of flittered... I could see his hair. It looked kind of greasy.
""J.R. Now was he as heavy as I am?
""B.H. Well I can't say 'cause he wasn't wearing those type of clothes. They were sloppy clothes, you know. And he just had on this old pair of pleated pants. I don't know... How tall are you?
""J.R. I'm about five eleven.

(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)
Case INV 1-15-311-F9-5861
""B.H. Well, like I say, he was dressed kind of sloppily, you know. His pants real tight up here and his stomach kind of pouched a bit, you know. I don't know... it's hard to say 'cause I can't judge you with being in a suit and all, you know, and him not being professional-looking at all. He could be about the same. It's hard to say. He was so sloppily dressed.
""J.R. Bryan, you also mentioned a drawl. Well not a drawl, an accent.
""B.H. It was just something... I guess his way of talking. It was something I couldn't repeat. It's like a song. Sometimes you know what you're going to say but you just can't sing the melody worth a darn.
""J.R. Did he have a throaty voice or a high pitched?
""B.H. In between. But it was just a unique way of talking.
""J.R. Did he sound like an educated man?
""B.H. Heck no! I don't think so.
""J.R. Did he sound illiterate?
""B.H. No. He didn't sound that way either. He just impressed me as being rather low class. The reason was because of his clothes, you know.
""J.R. Did you lose consciousness when he stabbed you at any time? Did you observe him stab Cecelia?
""B.H. Yeah...
""J.R. What did he say after...
""B.H. He stabbed her a bunch of times in the back. After she turned around, he got her once in the groin and one in the arm I think. He kind of went a little more hog-wild with her than with me. I faked dead... like that... I didn't want him to come back and give me some more.
""J.R. So you were pretty sure he thought you were dead when he finished working on you?

""B.H. I think he kind of thought that. Of course I don't know because we started talking right after he left. It's hard to say... (unintelligible)... I don't think she fainted either.
""J.R. Was she in a lot of pain, did she tell you?
""B.H. Oh yeah. She was more weak at the time... (unintelligible).. from the religious angle. I told her I sure as heck wasn't going to have any deathbed conversion. 'No,' she says... (unintelligible)... I mean it was just like you were gonna die and had a few things to say. But I felt more and more I wasn't losing strength as much... (unintelligible)... that I thought I could cope with...
""J.R. What you did was a courageous thing. It was a terrible thing to have happen to anyone.
""B.H. Well there was nothing we could do. We were kind of at the mercy of him. I mean I wanted to get that gun... (unintelligible)... There was a time I think I could have gotten it...
""J.R. Did it appear to be a .45 to you? An automatic?
""B.H. It was about this long... along the stock... and had a wood edge on it, you know.. on either side...
""J.R. Handles.
""B.H. Yeah...yeah...
""J.R. Did the bullet look anything like that?
""B.H. No. It was kind of like this, only it was gold, and this part here came out along with this and then round the gold, round the blunt end. Not quite that blunt-ended, though.
""J.R. Was it fat? Fatter than this?
""B.H. Yeah, I think it was a little fatter. But it was gold, you know. And I didn't see any of this here. There was a part where it crimped... Well, almost like that 22, short, only a lot bigger. It was about like this length, maybe more stubby.

""J.R. Well I'll get a .45 a little later and we can bring it up and let you observe it.
""B.H. ""Let's take the suspect. His hands... I don't remember if they had gloves on or not. I can't remember now. I keep thinking that he had gloves on. I can't figure how he tied us... Let's ask Celia, she probably knows about that.
""J.R. Did he swear? Did he use any profane language or obscenity?
""B.H. I don't think so. If he did it was no more than I was using at the time. I don't think he used any obscenity. He might have used a swear word or something, you know. That wasn't striking to me...
""J.R. Do you have any idea what his motive might have been? Money?
""B.H. Money. He said he was going to go to Mexico and he was flat broke.
""J.R. Did he search you after he...
""B.H. Heck no! Very unprofessional. He didn't even end up taking that loose change and didn't even take my billfold.
""J.R. Why did he stab you when you weren't fighting him off or anything?
""B.H. I couldn't. Even if I'd have wanted to. I was laying on my stomach...
""J.R. So what would have been the purpose of him to stab you, do you think?
""B.H. Well I (unintelligible)...but I think he got rattled... (unintelligible)... very, very nervous. His hands were shaking... (unintelligible)... Are you nervous?
""J.R. I'm just curious. If you could write me that symbol you were telling me about. Do you think you could draw me a picture of that even without your glasses?
""B.H. Um hum (affirmative). (Draws)... kind of like that. I can't see very well...

""J.R. Does this ring a bell?
""B.H. This one here. This is more like it, but I'm not sure. It was distinctly that design. It was thick. More thick marks.

William White at Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters. White was interviewed as to his activities before and during his part in locating the victims the night before. White stated at approximately 1855 hours 9/27/69 he was on routine patrol around the Lake Berryessa area when he received a call from Park Headquarters to proceed to the Rancho Monticello Resort where a person was reporting a possible stabbing. 
White stated he proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort where he was contacted by ARCHIE E. WHITE, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG. RONALD FONG advised him that he had seen a male and a female victim on the beach area south of Rancho Monticello Resort, hollering that they had been stabbed. Ranger Sgt. White, accompanied by ARCHIE WHITE, ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the beach area via speedboat owned by ARCHIE WHITE. When they arrived on the beach they observed a young female lying on the ground with what appeared to be numerous stab wounds. 
Ranger Sgt. White stated that the female appeared to be in a great deal of pain. White stated as they discovered the female victim, Ranger Dennis Land arrived at the scene in his pickup truck, carrying a male victim who also appeared to have numerous stab wounds. White stated he immediately radioed in and had Park Headquarters call the Sheriff's Office to dispatch an ambulance and a Deputy. White stated he attempted to interview both the boy and girl victims while awaiting arrival of the ambulance. According to White, the male victim said that a male subject approached them, wearing a hood, dressed in dark clothing. The subject was carrying what appeared to be an automatic pistol and stated that he wanted their money and car keys. 
According to White, the male victim related to him that the subject advised him he was an ex-con out of Colorado and was en route to Mexico. Suspect stated he had to tie them up, and after they were tied the responsible stated, ""I'm going to have to stab you."" White further related that the male victim advised the responsible, ""Stab me first, I can't stand to see her stabbed first."" The male victim then advised that the responsible stabbed him numerous times in the back and then stabbed the girl.
The female victim advised White that she could not see the responsible's face as a hood was covering all of his head. She also advised White that the suspect had what appeared to be clip-on sunglasses to cover his eyes. Ranger Sgt. White stated that this is the most he could get out of either victim as they were both in great shock and pain. White stated that he noticed a lot of blood near the girl's groin area. The interview with Ranger Sgt. White was terminated at that point.

MR. BYRD advised that MISS JUDY was a student at the college and had left the college earlier in the afternoon, driving a yellow Datsun. At 2135 hours Reporting Officers put out an All Points Bulletin around the City and County of Napa for this above described vehicle. At 2137 hours Officers received permission to interview the victim BRYAN HARTNELL who was taken to the X-Ray Room for x-rays. Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Lonergan attempted to interview BRYAN HARTNELL while in the presence of DONALD JUDAH and hospital attendant CLIFFORD MEAGHER. Sgt. Narlow was called away to answer a phone before the interview got under way. HARTNELL appeared to be in extreme pain and also appeared to be in shock. Reporting Officer Lonergan introduced himself to HARTNELL and asked him to give us any information he had on his assailant. HARTNELL stated that the assailant was wearing a black ceremonial type hood, square on top, and appeared to be heavy-set, between 200 and 250 pounds. He also stated his assailant had approached both him and MISS SHEPARD with a gun but had stabbed them with a long knife. HARTNELL further stated the gun was in a black holster and the knife was in a sheath. He stated that the attacker was wearing dark clothing, dark jacket and dark pants. HARTNELL further stated that the gun was an automatic pistol and the knife had a black handle and appeared to be homemade.
It should be noted that HARTNELL was very groggy and he was very difficult to interview at that time. Subject was re-interviewed the next day by Det/Sgt. Robertson and gave more complete details. (The report of Sgt. Robertson's interview is attached.)
At 2215 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan left the Queen of the Valley Hospital after advising Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and William Munk to take charge of the clothing of the victims and any other evidence from the victims when it was released from the hospital. Munk and Brambrink were also advised to stand by at the hospital as a security measure until other arrangements could be made.
As Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan were arriving at the Napa County Sheriff's Office, they were advised by the Napa Police Department that they had located MISS JUDY in the downtown Napa area and were bringing her to the Napa County Sheriff's Office. MISS [JUDY] was interviewed by Lonergan and Narlow at the Napa County Sheriff's Office. She was further identified as MISS JUDITH, a student at Pacific Union College, with a permanent residence address of Sun Valley, California. MISS [JUDITH] advised that she was with BRYAN

HARTNELL and CECELIA SHEPARD earlier in the afternoon. She stated that they all left Pacific Union College together at approximately 1:00 P.M. and went to a rummage sale in the City of St. Helena. She stated that BRYAN had bought a T.V. set at the rummage sale and had to transport it back to his room at Pacific Union College. She stated he left CECELIA at the rummage sale as there was not enough room in his car. MISS [JUDITH] stated BRYAN returned to the St. Helena area and picked up CECELIA at approximately 2:00 P.M. MISS [JUDITH] stated as far as she knew, both BRYAN and CECELIA were planning to go to San Francisco when they left her in St. Helena. MISS [JUDITH] stated she had no knowledge of any plans that BRYAN and CECELIA were making to go to the Lake Berryessa area. MISS [JUDITH] stated the last time she saw BRYAN and CECELIA was approximately 2:00 P.M. in the afternoon.
The interview with MISS [JUDITH] was terminated at that point.
Det/Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow then proceeded to Lake Berryessa and arrived at the scene of the crime, which was approximately a mile and a half north of Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters, at 2354 hours. The scene was being preserved by uniformed officers and under the direct control of Deputy Sheriffs David Collins and Ray Land. The investigating officers were briefed by Officers Collins and Land as to what had taken place prior to our arrival. Officers observed a 1956 white Kharman Ghia with a black vinyl top, Oregon license plate 4 U 2040. Investigating officers were shown footprints in dirt area and tire tracks, both believed to have been left by responsible. Investigating officers awaited the arrival of Sgt. Tom Butler who had been called to take photographs of the crime scene area and Sgt. Hal Snook, criminalist for collection and preservation of physical evidence. R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were advised by Park Ranger Dennis Land who had also arrived at the scene that it was possible to get to the beach area by vehicle from a locked gate approximately one-half mile south of the victim's vehicle. Officers proceeded to the area and arrived at the footpath approximately halfway between the scene of the crime at the beach and the victim's vehicle on the road. At that point, after a brief examination of the footpath area, officers discovered a similar footprint on the footpath to that found at the scene of the victim's vehicle. At that point, due to the lateness and darkness of the hour, Reporting Officers decided to completely secure the area and make a thorough search of the scene at first light. Officers then exited the crime scene area in the same manner and locked the aforementioned gate leading to this vicinity. Investigating officers along with Park Ranger Dennis Land went to the Berryessa Park Headquarters.

took into his possession certain items belonging to the victims that were taken into evidence by Ranger Dennis Land. These items consisted of a blanket, a pair of man's shoes, a wallet belonging to BRYAN HARTNELL, eyeglasses, and playing cards. Among the various aforementioned items believed to belong to the victims, were numerous strands of white plastic line cut into various assorted lengths, some of which had what appeared to be bloodstains. These items were subsequently turned over to Det/Sgt. Hal Snook for preservation.
Assigned investigators then proceeded back to the scene where the victim's car was parked and assisted Sgt. Snook in the making of the plaster casts. At approximately 0245 hours Sgt. Lonergan, having previously obtained the keys to the vehicle from BRYAN HARTNELL's property at Queen of the Valley Hospital, drove the white Kharman Ghia to the maintenance shop at Berryessa Park Headquarters. The vehicle was parked inside of the maintenance shop building and the building was secured for the evening by investigating officers with the assistance of Park Ranger Dennis Land. Assigned Investigators then returned back to the scene where the victim's vehicle had been previously parked and awaited the arrival of Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and Mel Fechter who were assigned to security duty in the crime scene area. At approximately 0300 hours officers assumed their duties at the crime scene area and the security was placed under the direction of Deputy Allen Brambrink. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then returned to their respective residences with plans to continue the investigation at daybreak.
9/28/69 0700 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene at Lake Berryessa area, accompanied by Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Capt. Donald Townsend, and Sgt. James Munk. Officers then assisted Det/Sgt. Snook in tracking the footprints from the vehicle to the scene of the crime by the beach area. (The location and preservation of aforementioned footprints will be detailed in a supplementary evidence report by Sgt. Snook.)
At 0800 hours Reporting Officers Lonergan and Narlow received information via Park Headquarters that a DR. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his son would like to talk to them at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop regarding a possible suspect in this crime. At 0912 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan contacted DR. R. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his 16-yr. old son DAVID LEE RAYFIELD at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop. DR. RAYFIELD gave a home address of Los Gatos, California. DR. RAYFIELD stated that about 6:30 P.M. the previous evening he and his son had parked their car north of Park Headquarters in the general area of the

crime scene. They stated they went down towards the beach area when DAVID RAYFIELD noticed a white male adult subject walking in the area, described as about 5'10"", heavy build, wearing dark trousers, a dark shirt with red in it, long sleeves. He stated this subject was carrying nothing in his hands and was apparently just walking alongside the hill area about halfway between the road and the lake. DAVID further stated that when the subject observed him he turned around and walked up the hill in a southerly direction. DR. RAYFIELD and his son stated that they did not notice a vehicle in the area of their vehicle and only this subject at a distance of about 100 yards. They also advised there was a man with two young boys in the area shooting B-B guns, but they did not know if this man saw the subject or not. This location was approximately 8/10ths of a mile from the scene of the victim's vehicle. In the opinion of R/Os, it is unlikely, unless this male subject had a vehicle in the immediate area, he could have traversed the area to the scene of the crime on foot. There are four coves of water between the scene of the crime and the area where the doctor saw the subject. The interview with DR. RAYFIELD and his son was terminated at that point.
At 1000 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene of the crime and further assisted Sgt. Snook in the collecting and locating of evidence.
At 1320 hours 9/28/69, R/Os interviewed Ranger Sgt. William White at Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters. White was interviewed as to his activities before and during his part in locating the victims the night before. White stated at approximately 1855 hours 9/27/69 he was on routine patrol around the Lake Berryessa area when he received a call from Park Headquarters to proceed to the Rancho Monticello Resort where a person was reporting a possible stabbing.

arrival of the ambulance. According to White, the male victim said that a male subject approached them, wearing a hood, dressed in dark clothing. The subject was carrying what appeared to be an automatic pistol and stated that he wanted their money and car keys.

White stated that this is the most he could get out of either victim as they were both in great shock and pain. White stated that he noticed a lot of blood near the girl's groin area. The interview with Ranger Sgt. White was terminated at that point.
9/28/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort and interviewed MR. ARCHIE E. WHITE. (It should be noted that ARCHIE E. WHITE and ELIZABETH WHITE are no relation to Ranger Sgt. White.) ARCHIE E. WHITE is the owner of the Boat Repair Shop at Rancho Monticello Resort. He lives at the Resort. Also interviewed were MR. WHITE's wife, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE. MR. and MRS. WHITE advised that they were contacted by RONALD FONG who advised them he had just observed what appeared to be a male and a female subject lying on the beach south of the Rancho Monticello Resort, covered with blood. FONG advised them that the couple had shouted out to him that they had been stabbed and robbed. MRS. WHITE immediately called Park Headquarters and Ranger Sgt. William White arrived at the Resort a short time later. MR. and MRS. WHITE, accompanied by Ranger Sgt. Bill White and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the scene area in one of MR. WHITE's ski boats. When they arrived on the scene, they observed a young female wearing a sweater dress lying on the beach, covered with blood. When they approached the area she was on her elbows and knees, rocking back and forth as if in great pain. MRS. WHITE stated she immediately attempted to make the victim more comfortable and tried to calm her down until the ambulance arrived. MRS. WHITE stated the girl advised him, ""He was a man with a hood... His face was covered... He was wearing black pants... It hurts, it

hurts."" MRS. WHITE then advised after the female had regained her composure, she told her the man had asked for money but didn't take any. She said she hadn't been raped. MRS. WHITE further advised that the female victim told her that the responsible was wearing glasses, with dark clip-on sunglasses over the hood. She told her that the responsible had a black pistol. MR. ARCHIE WHITE stated he overheard the male victim advise someone that the responsible was wearing gloves. MR. and MRS. WHITE further advised that this is the only information either victim gave them on the responsible, and that they spent the balance of the time attempting to make the victim more comfortable until the arrival of the ambulance.
After the interview with MR. and MRS. WHITE, Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan returned to the Napa County Sheriff's Office.
At 1620 hours R/O Det/Sgt. Narlow was contacted by a DEAN of the Pacific Union College in Angwin. DEAN advised that three young ladies, students at the college, might possibly have information as to a suspect in the attack at Lake Berryessa. The young ladies were identified as MISS JOANNE, MISS LINDA, and MISS LINDA. DEAN advised that these girls had been in the Lake Berryessa area from about 3:00 P.M. to 4:30 P.M. the previous Saturday afternoon. They had observed a male subject in a late model, silver blue Chevrolet, two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. DEAN advised that the girls had told him they were observed out of the car by this subject while they were sunbathing on the beach. They described the subject as approximately 40 years old, [blank] feet tall, dressed in dark clothing. Sgt. Narlow dispatched Deputy Sheriff Raymond Land to interview these three girls that evening. (The report of Land's interview is attached.)
Reporting Officers spent the balance of the day and evening going through their investigative notes and issuing a statewide All Points Bulletin.
Monday, 9/29/69 Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan spent the majority of the morning interviewing numerous citizens and officers from other departments regarding this crime and similar crimes. (A general list of possible suspects was begun and they are noted on separate incident reports as to origin of information and description of suspects, attached.)
Reporting Officers were advised by Deputy Sheriff Ray Land who interviewed the three college girls, MISS [JOANNE], MISS [LINDA], and MISS [LINDA] that the information appeared to have some merit and advised that the three young ladies would be in the office in the afternoon for further interview.

9/29/69 1445 hours The three young ladies came into the office and were interviewed by Sgt. Lonergan, Sgt. Snook, and Capt. Donald Townsend.
Lonergan interviewed a MISS JOANNE MARIE, who, [age] years of age, DOB [blank], her address at the college is 114 Dauphine, Pacific Union College, home address South East 12th, College Place, Washington. MISS [JOANNE] advised R/O that on 9/27/69 at approximately 5:30 P.M. she and her two girlfriends parked their vehicle at a location two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. When they left their car they noticed a subject driving a late model silver blue Chevrolet, 2-door sedan, pull up behind them. What appeared to be a white male adult was sitting in the vehicle. They did not observe this subject leave the vehicle. The girls proceeded to the beach area and were sunbathing in their bikinis. After approximately one-half hour had passed, they observed what appeared to be the same subject standing within 40 or 50 feet of them, apparently observing them. This subject was described as 6' tall, weighing 200/210 lbs., muscular build, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing dark pants and a dark pullover shirt. The subject would stare at the three girls but when they looked up at him he would look away. The subject hung around the area for approximately 45 minutes and then the girls observed him walk up the hill. MISS [JOANNE] stated it was very doubtful that from his vantage point in the vehicle the subject could observe the three girls on the beach. She believes he waited in his vehicle and then followed them down after they were on the beach. MISS [JOANNE] further described the car as appearing very conservative. She stated the car did not appear to belong to any young person such as a teenager. She did state the car had California license plates but did not notice the number.
The other two young ladies, MISS [LINDA] and MISS [LINDA] were interviewed by Sgt. Snook and Capt. Donald Townsend.
MISS LINDA who was interviewed by R/O Det/Sgt. Snook, is a WFA, DOB [blank], home address Sunnyside Road, Sanitarium. She stated she left the Angwin area with two other girls, JOANNE and LINDA at approximately 2:45 P.M. 9/27/69. The girls drove through Pope Valley to Lake Berryessa where they parked their vehicle two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand. MISS [LINDA] stated she observed a subject go into the parking lot area to the south. Subject went past their vehicle and backed up so their rear bumpers were nearly touching. Vehicle described as a 1966 or 1967 light blue Chevrolet with California plates. Witness believes the vehicle was a 2-door sedan and described the headlights as being long rather than round. The rear window glass was tinted quite dark. Another vehicle from Angwin with Arizona plates was in the parking area and witness saw the occupants, a MISS DENISE BROWN and a MR. WAYNE HAIGHT.

to the beach and shortly thereafter noticed the male subject watching them from the edge of the trees. After about 30 minutes the subject came down by the beach and passed within 20 feet of witness as he walked from south to north. Subject was described by MISS [LINDA] as approximately 28 years of age, 6' to 6'2"" tall, 200/225 lbs., black hair possibly styled, with a part on left, rounded eyes, thin lips, medium nose, straight eyebrows, small ears, well built, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing a black short-sleeved sweater shirt, bunched up in front, and a white tee shirt hanging out in back, and dark trousers. The three girls left the area about 4:30 P.M. and the subject's vehicle was gone. Witnesses did not observe the subject either leave or get back into his vehicle.
MISS LINDA LEE was interviewed by R/O Capt. Donald Townsend. MISS [LINDA LEE] is a WFA, DOB [blank], address Howell Mountain Road, Angwin. MISS [LINDA LEE] is employed as a secretary of the college press. MISS [LINDA LEE] observed the same vehicle which was described as a late model Chevrolet, sky blue in color. The rear tail lights appeared to be long rather than round. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated they parked their vehicle at approximately 2:55 P.M. and observed the subject in his vehicle at that location. The girls proceeded to the beach and she, MISS [LINDA LEE], again noticed the subject about 30 to 45 minutes after they were at the beach. She noticed him standing on the bank approximately 45 yards from her location. She described the subject as 6 feet tall, stocky build, about 200 lbs., black short-sleeved sweater shirt, dark blue slacks, and straight dark hair neatly combed. She guessed his age at approximately 30 years. Subject had medium color skin and was not wearing glasses. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated she thought she saw a white belt around his back but it possibly was a tee shirt hanging out. She further stated that the man was fairly nice-looking, with a round face. She did not observe the subject leave the area in his vehicle.
9/29/69 - 1600 hours Reporting Officers Sgt. Narlow and Sgt. Lonergan were advised by Capt. Joseph Page that the female victim, MISS CECELIA SHEPARD, had just died at Queen of the Valley Hospital.

Page further advised R/Os that the remains would be removed to Morrison Funeral Home where DR. DE PETRIS would complete the autopsy.
At 1945 hours 9/29/69, R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were contacted by Probation Officer H. B. Schotte. Mr. Schotte had observed the footprint design that R/Os had taken at the scene and stated he had knowledge of a possible similar shoe sole design. Mr. Schotte brought into the office a MR.

Air Force Base and is a Flight Line Mechanic. He is a retired Master Sergeant in the United States Air Force. MR. [BASSEL] showed R/O a pair of Air Force chukker boots that belonged to him. He described these boots as being Government issue, issued to all Air Force personnel at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. They are primarily designed as a wing-walker shoe, however according to MR. [BASSEL] most Air Force personnel and many of the civilian personnel employed at Air Force bases had this type of shoe. The sole design of this shoe exactly matched the plaster cast design that Sgt. Snook had taken at the scene of the crime. It should be noted that Det/Sgt John Robertson had attempted to find a similar shoe design at the local shoe stores in the Napa area with negative results. (Refer Sgt. Robertson's supplementary report.) MR. [BASSEL] was asked if we could keep his shoes for identification purposes and he agreed. R/Os was also advised that this information regarding the type of footprint had not been released to the press or general public. MR. [BASSEL] stated he would cooperate with R/Os and keep this information confidential.
9/30/69, 0810 hours R/O Sgt. Lonergan received a telephone call from MISS MARILYN DENISE, 18 years of age, DOB [blank].

She stated shortly after they parked the vehicle they observed the victims who were known to them, BRYAN HARTNELL and CECELIA SHEPARD, driving south on Knoxville Road in BRYAN's white Kharman Ghia. She stated as the HARTNELL vehicle drove by, BRYAN waved out the window and said, ""Hi, John!"", referring to MR. [JOHN]. MISS [MARILYN] stated that they did not see the HARTNELL vehicle any other time that day.
9/30/69, 0900 hours R/Os Det/Sgt. Narlow and Det/Sgt. Richard Lonergan, accompanied by Sgt. Thomas Butler, proceeded to the Morrison Funeral Home in St. Helena.

advised that the cause of death was shock and loss of blood brought on by two main stab wounds.
9/30/69, 1430 hours R/O Det/Sgt. Kenneth Narlow contacted CAPT. at Travis Air Force Base and arranged for an interview with COL. and SGT. to take place on Wednesday morning, October 1st, 1969, at 9:00 A.M. R/Os wanted to talk to someone at Travis regarding the shoeprints that were found on the scene. The remainder of the day and evening was spent in answering phone calls from people who had possible knowledge of the crime.
Wednesday, 10/1/69 - 0900 hours Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow went to Travis Air Force Base and were present at an interview in Col. office, who is Commanding Officer in charge of base security. Also present at this meeting besides the aforementioned officers was LT. COL. of the Office of Special Investigation. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan advised the Air Force personnel present of the portion of the evidence we had discovered at the crime scene and asked them for assistance in locating where this type of shoe was sold or issued. LT. COL. advised that his office would assist assigned investigators in attempting to locate the source of the shoe.
Officers were directed to the Base Supply with the assistance of Special Agent DONALD of O.S.I., at which time it was determined through Base Supply that this shoe in question was of Government issue and that it was not kept in stock at Base Supply, however it was believed that the Sales Store had such an item. It was then explained that if a military person or civilian employee was determined to be in need of such an item, he first reported to the Base Supply, at which time he was issued a purchase requisition which he in turn took to the Sales Store and the type of shoe was issued to the individual and they in turn required the individual to sign the purchase requisition showing that he did receive the item. This purchase requisition states the type of shoe that the individual was to receive, however makes no reference as to size.
Assigned investigators, accompanied by Special Agent proceeded to the Sales Store located on Travis Air Force Base. After a short period of time R/Os located in stock a shoe fitting the identical description of the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast which officers had in their possession. The identical shoe with identical tread was found and a shoe bearing the closest measurements in the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast was measured and found to be a size 10 1/2 in military styling or a 10 1/2 D in civilian equivalent. It was determined through Air Force records that they were unable to furnish officers with the

data regarding the sales of this type shoe due to the fact that no recordings were made of the specific sizes, however purchase records indicate over the past 13 months approximately 100 pairs of this size shoe, namely 10 1/2, had been purchased and disposed of through sales. Air Force records indicate this type shoe is manufactured by the International Shoe Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, then shipped to Air Force Depot, Ogden, Utah, and from there shipped to the various military installations upon requisition orders.
10/1/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then proceeded to the Vallejo Police Department and met with Sgt. Jack Mullanax and Sgt. Duane Nilsson. Officers exchanged information regarding Vallejo's crime of 7/4/69 and our particular incident. Suspect information was exchanged and is listed in the separate suspect file.
Investigating Officers checked to determine the validity of the decoded message and as to how far the original cyphers had been decoded. It was then learned that the message had been decoded by at least two different sources, one being by MR. and MRS. HARDIN of Salinas and the other by the FBI in Washington. It was noted that these cyphers were broken independent of one another and the FBI confirmed the validity of the original decoded message. It was also learned that there was a small portion on the very end of the coded message that had not been decoded for reasons unknown.
The balance of the afternoon and evening Reporting Officers and other investigating officers met to exchange information and further discuss the evidence at hand.
Thursday, October 2nd, 1969, 0845 hours Reporting Officer Lonergan received a telephone call from Special Agent, OSI, Travis Air Force Base. Subject called to report that approximately 500 to 1,000 of that type of wing-walker shoe have been sold as surplus on the Base. This would be over and above those sold at the Sales Store. Agent further related he has the names of all the subjects who have purchased this item through surplus and will keep these names available to officers upon request.
The balance of the morning was spent searching fingerprint evidence and answering phone calls from possible witnesses.
Thursday, 10/2/69, 1400 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan attended the funeral services for victim CECELIA SHEPARD. These services were held at the Pacific Union College Church, Angwin, California. Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan positioned themselves

inside the church in order to observe all persons who viewed the services and the remains of victim CECELIA SHEPARD. Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Sgt. Thomas Butler, and Detective Ronald Montgomery of the Napa Police Department positioned themselves outside the church and photographed all persons entering and leaving the services. This included individual photographs and group scenes. Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow also attended the graveside services at the St. Helena Cemetery in St. Helena.
Friday, 10/3/69 - Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Richard Lonergan contacted JAMES, Napa State Hospital, advised him to set up an interview with a patient who is a possible suspect in our case. The patient is identified as GRIFFIN RAYMOND FRANKLIN, WMA, 20 yrs. of age, DOB [blank], 6'2"", 223 lbs. [JAMES] had previously reported that this subject had left the hospital on a pass Friday evening, 9/26/69, and returned to the hospital Monday afternoon, 9/29/69. This subject also had spent time in the Air Force and was discharged from the Air Force in January 1969 for psychiatric problems. According to the doctors at the hospital, this subject was capable of committing this type of a crime. R/O in the presence of JAMES and Security Officer PHIL RYAN interviewed subject FRANKLIN. FRANKLIN was very cooperative and talkative to R/O and went over his activities the prior weekend. Briefly stated, MR. FRANKLIN, whose parents live in Vallejo, never left the Vallejo area that weekend and stayed around home talking with his mother, stepfather, and three brothers. After interviewing subject, it was the opinion of R/O Sgt. Lonergan that this subject was not the responsible. He had a definite very fast manner of speaking which was completely opposed to the victim's statement concerning the suspect's voice. R/O also contacted the mother of the suspect, a MRS. OPAL at Hollywood Avenue, Vallejo. MRS. OPAL stated more or less the exact same thing that her son had stated as to his whereabouts that weekend. It appears that this subject has a reliable alibi as to his activities and had no access to a vehicle that weekend. This subject was cleared as far as this crime is concerned.
The balance of the morning and afternoon was spent by R/Os Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan going over physical evidence and dictating reports.

9/28/69 12:30 P.M. Reporting Officer John Robertson, Det/Sgt., interviewed one of two victims who were each stabbed numerous times by an unknown assailant. Victim CECELIA SHEPARD and victim BRYAN HARTNELL both had been placed in the Queen of the Valley Hospital intensive care unit. Victim SHEPARD had surgery performed on her earlier in the morning (9/28/69) and was unable to be questioned by the Reporting Officer, however Dr. Ludwig gave permission for victim HARTNELL to be interviewed.
Although victim HARTNELL was heavily sedated, he was able to give R/O a verbal statement. (Note: R/O taped electrically the interview with victim HARTNELL.) Victim HARTNELL related the following.
He had known CECELIA SHEPARD for some time, they were good friends, and she had come to the Napa County area to spend the weekend. She and a female companion, DALORA LEE, Aspen, Loma Linda, San Bernardino County, Calif. (phone Ext. 2155) had driven from Southern California and were to drive back Sunday, 9/28/69. Victim stated he and MISS SHEPARD drove to Lake Berryessa, picked a large tree near the shore line where they decided to lie down and enjoy the scenery. While lying on the ground, victim HARTNELL stated he heard a noise and asked MISS SHEPARD if she could hear anything or see anything behind a tree not far from where the couple were lying. MISS SHEPARD told victim HARTNELL she could see a man behind the tree. HARTNELL asked her what he was doing. MISS SHEPARD stated she couldn't tell. HARTNELL stated he (suspect) then came from behind the tree. MISS SHEPARD said, ""Oh my God, he has a gun!""
Victim HARTNELL stated the man approached the couple, aiming a black steel automatic pistol. The suspect stated he needed a car and money. Suspect stated his car was ""hot"" and he wanted victim HARTNELL's car keys. Victim HARTNELL stated he began talking with the suspect, telling the suspect he had no money, only a small amount of change, also that if the suspect was really in need of assistance HARTNELL would attempt to help him. The suspect told victim to get on the ground. Suspect then had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him. HARTNELL stated he attempted to keep the suspect engaged in conversation while suspect was tying the victims.
HARTNELL further stated the suspect was described as follows: Wearing a black hooded mask (cloth), covering suspect's entire head and shoulders, coming down almost to suspect's waist. Victim stated on front of the four-cornered type mask (similar to paper bag in style) there was a symbol, the symbol described as white, approximately 3 x 3 inches in diameter, with a symmetrical cross. Also on the eyelets of the mask was a pair of clip-on sunglasses, the glasses clipped to the eyelets. Victim stated he could also see hair through the mask's eyelets and observed the hair to be dark brown.
Victim stated suspect was wearing a light-weight windbreaker, dark blue or black, pleated slacks (old-fashioned type). Victim could not remember what type of shoes or anything about suspect's hands, could not remember if suspect was wearing gloves.
Victim thought suspect was possibly 20 to 30 years of age by voice concept. Victim stated suspect was 5'8"" to 6', 225-250 lbs., dark brown hair, eyes unknown, sloppy dresser, stomach hanging over trousers. Suspect spoke with some

type of drawl, but victim stated it was not a Southern drawl, did not really know what type of drawl, but thought the man was not well educated, but did not feel he was illiterate either. Victim said suspect's voice was moderate in sound, that is, not high or low pitched.
Suspect told victim he was sent to (?) Lodge State Prison (possibly Deer Lodge State Prison), Montana, for a killing. While there (in prison) he killed a guard while escaping. Suspect also told victims he was heading for Mexico, told victim he was flat broke.
Victim observed cut-up rope in suspect's rear pocket (trouser's), also stated he was wearing a knife in a case (on belt) on his right side, near front of trousers. Knife description: Appeared to be a long bread knife, 12"" long blade, 3/4"" wide, hardwood handle, 2 brass rivets holding handle in place, cotton surgical tape wrapped approximately 1"" around handle of knife. Knife case possibly made of wood.
Victim asked suspect if suspect's gun was loaded. Suspect removed magazine from handle of pistol and showed victim a bullet removed from gun, bullet described as a possible .45 caliber. Victim did not know what caliber the pistol was.
Suspect had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him, suspect then tied victim SHEPARD's hands, then re-tied HARTNELL's hands, then tied both victims' ankles together, had victims lie on their stomachs.

Sgt. ROBERTSON stated that Mr. HARTNELL was heavily sedated but was able to give a verbal statement pertaining to the attack at Lake Berrysessa. The interview was taped and reads as follows:
""INTERVIEW OF JOHN ROBERTSON, DET/SGT., NAPA COUNTY SHERIFF's DEPARTMENT, WITH BRYAN CALVIN HARTNELL (NSO CASE #105907) AT QUEEN OF THE VALLEY HOSPITAL ON SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1969 (TRANSCRIBED FROM TAPE RECORDING BY M. FEURLE):
""J.R. Can you give me this fellow's description and tell me what happened?
""B.H. So many people have been asking me... I hope...
""J.R. Well sometimes when we're repetitious, I know it happens to me, I tell the same thing over and over and over, and sometimes I might vary a little, and if you do...
""B.H. Shall I just start out and tell you what happened?
""J.R. I don't want to tire you out.
""B.H. I just don't want this to happen again to anybody... Of course he might have his reasons, I don't know...
""J.R. Okay. Go right ahead. Start right from the beginning. What happened?
""B.H. Okay. This girl came out from school, I used to go with her two years ago, and she's now going to another school, and she came up to visit some friends and we were having dinner at the school cafeteria, and I said, 'Well, are you doing anything special this afternoon?' and she said, 'Why?', and I said, 'I don't know. We could go out and either go for a walk, go to San Francisco, or, you know, just...', 'cause we used to be good friends. We used to have a good friendship. And so it got too late by the time we got around to what we were going to do. We had to stop in St. Helena for a couple items and then we had to cart a couple kids home and stuff, and by the time we finally got around to it, it was getting late, and I thought going to San Francisco 'd rush you, you know, because by the time we got back for worship... And so we went out to Berryessa, and there was this one place I used to go out... we used to all the time, you know... and I couldn't find it. And so I figured Ah, forget it, and this looks like as good a place as any. So I parked the car, there were no other cars there. I had a Kharman Ghia, '56, white, with a black vinyl top, and it's in pretty

... ""good-looking shape. But we parked there on the road's edge and we talked Oh it must be about a quarter of a mile to down to the place where we went. We had... (unintelligible) peninsula, it's an an island I guess during the wetter season, You can see where it was levee... And so that looked like a lot... there was a big spreading tree up there. There were two of them, really, one was a little bigger than the other. We took the one that was out on the point.
""It was really beautiful out there. We were sitting on top... I lay down on my back and she lay down on her stomach beside me, you know, kind of resting her head on my shoulder, and we were talking, you know, kind of reminiscing about old times, and stuff. And I heard these rustling leaves, and I said, 'You have your specs on. Why don't you see what the deal is over there?' And she says, 'Oh, it's some man.' And I said, 'Is he alone?' and she said, 'Yeah... (unintelligible)...' and she says, 'Well he just stepped behind the tree.' And I said, 'What's the idea of that? To take a leak?' You know, 'cause that's the only thing I could think of, just step behind a tree. And so I says, 'Well, keep looking and tell me what happens,' and she says, 'Oh my God, he's got a gun!' and squeezed my arm and
""And so he came out, and of course still actually I wasn't... There's some things you really wouldn't mind having happen, just for the experience of it. You know I thought, Well I only got fifty cents on me. It's worth all of that having it happen. I didn't think about another angle. So I talked to him, you know. I said, 'Well listen, Mac, (you know I'm in the sociologist field, you know, I'm pre-law, with history and psych.) You know I've read about the criminal mind and everything, you know. I thought well maybe the guy really does need help, you know. I says, 'There's no strings attached.' I says, 'I don't have any money right now but if you need help that badly I can help you out in another way maybe.' And he says, 'Nah.. time's running short,' he says, ''cause I just got out of... some prison in Montana, I don't know what the name of it is. Feathers? Do you know what the name of it is? I'll see if it sounds familiar. Fern or Feathers? It's some double name, like Fern Lock or something...
""J.R. It's Lodge..

""B.H. Oh yeah, yeah, Lodge. At least we know we're together on that.
""J.R. Mountain Lodge Prison, or something of that nature...
""B.H. Yeah. You know he said he broke out and had to kill a guard getting out. And I said, 'Well, man, I mean actually I don't mean to call your bluff or anything, but wouldn't you rather be stuck on a stealing charge than a threat of homicide?' you know? And he says, 'Well just don't start playing hero on me.' You know, 'Don't try to grab the gun,' 'cause I didn't really figure the gun was loaded. I always thought it would be empty. I've heard a lot of times that this is what they do just as a bluff, but I decided not to call his bluff after he really, you know... I told him, 'You know you're really wasting your time with me. I've got a billfold and this much change and that's it.' And he said, he told the girl, 'Go tie him up. I'd feel much better if you were tied up.' And she tied a couple of loose knots on me, so I made it look kind of tight... (unintelligible)... you know, just for a second, and he said 'Go ahead.' And I whispered to her, 'You know I think I can get that gun.' And I said, 'Do you mind?' and she got kind of fearful about it, so I figured since there's two lives involved, not just mine, I won't do it.
""So I let her tie me up on the wrists again, and he tied her up, - terribly tight, you know, real... (unintelligible) ... put his gun away, and we were talking and all, bantering, you know, basically. I was thinking, anything I can do to help, by the way just to keep the conversation going... Suddenly he was taking it all seriously, you know... So I was starting out and finally he said, 'Okay, lay down. I've got her tied up', you know... He strung a rope between our ankles in the rear, so we were like this, you know, on our stomachs, tied...
""J.R. You both facing the ground...
""B.H. Right. And, oh, this was before. I got sort of ahead. So anyway, he said, 'Get down,' and I said, 'Oh come on! We could freeze to death!' I said that a couple, three times, and he said, 'GET DOWN! RIGHT NOW!' He got a little pushed off at me. So I got down and then he finished tying her up and clonked her down, - and then he goes... Sswhooosh (a sound with his mouth)... (unintelligible)

""And so I said, 'Do you have bullets in there?' And so he pulled out the clip and showed me that he did. The bullets were about this long, I can remember, and about this fat, and they had the regular red cap on it, about this long. Maybe that doesn't give you any better description of the gun or not. I don't know. And it came out of the heel, the grip, you know. It slipped out from the bottom.
""And now, to backtrack a bit. I was really trying to see what he looked like, you know. He had on pleated pants, these old type of suit pants, you know, and they were either black or dark blue, I can't remember now. And I can't remember what he was wearing for shoes. But he had on this cotton coat, You've seen the kind, that you just turn the collar up once, there's a zipper down the front, you know. They're real light, super-thin, you know...
""J.R. Kind of a windbreaker...
""B.H. Yeah, like a windbreaker. And it's got this blue, this little collar, sometimes the guys wear them standing up, you know.
""J.R. What color was that?
""B.H. That was dark blue. And I don't know. Maybe he had something in his pouch. I just took it as being a... as being a... you know, he was stout 'cause he looked kind of heavy. I think he was weighing two and a quarter, two fifty, somewhere in there. And I got kind of a look at his hair. His voice... I can remember... almost like I'd heard it before. You know there's some drawls that a lot of people have similar. And... almost as if I'd heard it before... couldn't think where.
""I gave that one up, I just gave it up on that angle. I looked through his hair. I kind of looked like it was combed, you know, like this.. it was a brownish, you know, dark brown hair.
""And this mask he had on. It was ingeniously devised. It was... he had four corners at the top, like the top of a paper sack... black. It came down, came down, with the front panel about to here, and a kind of a thing that came over the shoulders, you know, and then the same thing down the back, straight down. And in the front he had a circle with a symmetrical cross in the middle. You know what I mean by a symmetrical cross?

Case INV 1-15-311-F9-5861
""J.R. Um hum (affirmative).
""B.H. The ends of the cross hung out about this far on each of the... you know, where it came out. The circle was this much... like this... and then it was like this, you see... hung out on the end, over the edge of the circle.
""And he had clip-on sunglasses... it was hard to tell. You know, the sunglasses you clip on when you're wearing glasses, eyeglasses, He had those clipped on. I'm pretty sure... I don't think he had glasses, though. I think he just had these clipped on to his suit... you know, that little mask.
""And I don't know how tall he was. Maybe 5-8 or maybe 5-10, 6 feet, somewhere in there. I'm a very poor judge of height because of my height. I have no meaning, you know. It's always down, you know. It can never be up...
""And so I saw him put away his gun, and I was turning to say something to Celia, and all of a sudden I felt my back... just... no, I think I saw him pull it out.. I don't remember... I think I saw him whip out his knife and just start stabbing me in the back... CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP! I was just (makes a gutteral sound)... you know that kind of a sound... and Celia turned to see why I was (repeats gutteral sound), you know, and she just about fainted. She went hysterical... (unintelligible) ... and when he finally stopped... I mean he went over and... The doctor says there's six in the back, six wounds on my back. You ought to confirm that. One I've got went clear through the lung. I've got it draining. I did drain a couple pints of blood out as soon as I got here. I lost an awful lot of blood, I guess.
""We were down... I mean it was absolutely no question in my mind... when a person gets stabbed as many times as we did... we were going to die. I mean there'd be no reason to question it. But somehow I, you know, started (unintelligible)... I just knew there was too much I had to live for. I mean really it does happen... about getting depressed and everything... when you're young you always think about these things... you know you think about it... and when you've got someone forcing your hand, oh well, there was a lot of things I had to do. And what really kept me going... you know my parents are pretty Christian. I haven't been too much of a Christian myself... but if you believe in the principle you ask God to help you. Another thing, What was my only strength was knowing two things. One, that I did not want to die, and two, that I felt that whatever was

""going to be was going to be, but I was going to try my damnedest to stay alive. And so, like I say, - before I left her I kissed her, and I said, 'Well,' I says, 'I'm gonna try to get help.'
""There was a boat kept circling around out there in the lake and we started yelling at it and finally it came within about 100 yards of the shore and turned off its motor and stayed there watching us for about fifteen minutes, and we were just screaming hysterically, trying to get their attention, you know, to come over here. Oh, I don't know, I guess they were afraid that the guy might be there in the bushes and they were liable to get choked or something. So finally he came up a little closer. I didn't have my glasses on... I was just swaying, you know... and I had gotten one of her hands free before they came, and so I kept trying to get her to untie me, and she couldn't, she was too weak, she said.
""So finally I just kept hollering and hollering, and she said, 'Turn around and let's see if I can do it again.' She finally got it. My hands and my feet were just pure numbness... they're still numb but I'm sure that will go 'way. But I finally got... (unintelligible)... untie her so she could kind of relax out. 'Cause it was a terrible position, you know, upon our stomachs... (unintelligible)...
""And so I started to go for help. I finally got myself fairly reconciled. I wasn't too worried about dying, if that was what was going to happen, but I knew I had to keep pushing on. I had to force myself into staying alive because it was... I could just see myself... you know, all sort of waves would come over... I just (coughing sound)... (unintelligible)... 'Well, you're not gonna give up this easy', you know. And, like I say, I just kept believing that God would do everything the best, if the thing was gonna happen, but I couldn't see any reason why my dying would be the best good. So I just played along with that.
""I just started to walk toward the road... everything blacked out on me... my visual... my mind was never blacked out, but my visual was. So I lay down... My eyes started to come open... I just saw a haze of trees, you know. In a little while I got up and went another twenty feet, and then the same thing happened... (unintelligible)... and sat down. Next thing I went clear... (unintelligible)... the road, and by that time I just fell... I just... I was trying so hard to go far I just went too far. Finally I heard this pickup

""coming... I was just laying alongside the road, and that's where this guy picked me up.
""They weren't in any hurry at all, it didn't seem like, you know, but they finally called an ambulance. About fifteen minutes later it came... (unintelligible)... but I still believe... I've got feeling... starting to get a little pain to come through. But from the minute that knife blade went in, it was nothing but pure shock from there on. I just did not expect it. I didn't expect that he would do that. That was a variable I had completely left out. And I guess he just took off running after we started running. I don't know. I never saw him before and hope not to see him again... at least outside of a courtroom.
""It's hard for me to explain much more. I mean I'm trying to give you a kind of example of his technique. He had some rope cut up in his back pocket. And he had a ... well, I thought it was a police automatic because it was in one of these black leather cases, you know...
""J.R. Was it in a smooth case, or did it have a basket weave like..
""B.H. Can I have my glasses? Oh, they're not here. It was a smooth one, though.
""J.R. Did he have this hood down to about the middle of his chest?
""B.H. No, about like... well, I'll show you... Here... his stomach.. You know I could see his... (voice fades away)
""J.R. Okay. You said his hair looked dark brown. How could you see his hair?
""B.H. 'Cause I saw it from where those goggles fit. I looked so closely to find out. And when he turned you know they kind of flittered... I could see his hair. It looked kind of greasy.
""J.R. Now was he as heavy as I am?
""B.H. Well I can't say 'cause he wasn't wearing those type of clothes. They were sloppy clothes, you know. And he just had on this old pair of pleated pants. I don't know... How tall are you?
""J.R. I'm about five eleven.

(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)
Case INV 1-15-311-F9-5861
""B.H. Well, like I say, he was dressed kind of sloppily, you know. His pants real tight up here and his stomach kind of pouched a bit, you know. I don't know... it's hard to say 'cause I can't judge you with being in a suit and all, you know, and him not being professional-looking at all. He could be about the same. It's hard to say. He was so sloppily dressed.
""J.R. Bryan, you also mentioned a drawl. Well not a drawl, an accent.
""B.H. It was just something... I guess his way of talking. It was something I couldn't repeat. It's like a song. Sometimes you know what you're going to say but you just can't sing the melody worth a darn.
""J.R. Did he have a throaty voice or a high pitched?
""B.H. In between. But it was just a unique way of talking.
""J.R. Did he sound like an educated man?
""B.H. Heck no! I don't think so.
""J.R. Did he sound illiterate?
""B.H. No. He didn't sound that way either. He just impressed me as being rather low class. The reason was because of his clothes, you know.
""J.R. Did you lose consciousness when he stabbed you at any time? Did you observe him stab Cecelia?
""B.H. Yeah...
""J.R. What did he say after...
""B.H. He stabbed her a bunch of times in the back. After she turned around, he got her once in the groin and one in the arm I think. He kind of went a little more hog-wild with her than with me. I faked dead... like that... I didn't want him to come back and give me some more.
""J.R. So you were pretty sure he thought you were dead when he finished working on you?

""B.H. I think he kind of thought that. Of course I don't know because we started talking right after he left. It's hard to say... (unintelligible)... I don't think she fainted either.
""J.R. Was she in a lot of pain, did she tell you?
""B.H. Oh yeah. She was more weak at the time... (unintelligible).. from the religious angle. I told her I sure as heck wasn't going to have any deathbed conversion. 'No,' she says... (unintelligible)... I mean it was just like you were gonna die and had a few things to say. But I felt more and more I wasn't losing strength as much... (unintelligible)... that I thought I could cope with...
""J.R. What you did was a courageous thing. It was a terrible thing to have happen to anyone.
""B.H. Well there was nothing we could do. We were kind of at the mercy of him. I mean I wanted to get that gun... (unintelligible)... There was a time I think I could have gotten it...
""J.R. Did it appear to be a .45 to you? An automatic?
""B.H. It was about this long... along the stock... and had a wood edge on it, you know.. on either side...
""J.R. Handles.
""B.H. Yeah...yeah...
""J.R. Did the bullet look anything like that?
""B.H. No. It was kind of like this, only it was gold, and this part here came out along with this and then round the gold, round the blunt end. Not quite that blunt-ended, though.
""J.R. Was it fat? Fatter than this?
""B.H. Yeah, I think it was a little fatter. But it was gold, you know. And I didn't see any of this here. There was a part where it crimped... Well, almost like that 22, short, only a lot bigger. It was about like this length, maybe more stubby.

""B.H. ""Let's take the suspect. His hands... I don't remember if they had gloves on or not. I can't remember now. I keep thinking that he had gloves on. I can't figure how he tied us... Let's ask Celia, she probably knows about that.
""J.R. Did he swear? Did he use any profane language or obscenity?
""B.H. I don't think so. If he did it was no more than I was using at the time. I don't think he used any obscenity. He might have used a swear word or something, you know. That wasn't striking to me...
""J.R. Do you have any idea what his motive might have been? Money?
""B.H. Money. He said he was going to go to Mexico and he was flat broke.
""J.R. Did he search you after he...
""B.H. Heck no! Very unprofessional. He didn't even end up taking that loose change and didn't even take my billfold.
""J.R. Why did he stab you when you weren't fighting him off or anything?
""B.H. I couldn't. Even if I'd have wanted to. I was laying on my stomach...
""J.R. So what would have been the purpose of him to stab you, do you think?
""B.H. Well I (unintelligible)...but I think he got rattled... (unintelligible)... very, very nervous. His hands were shaking... (unintelligible)... Are you nervous?
""J.R. I'm just curious. If you could write me that symbol you were telling me about. Do you think you could draw me a picture of that even without your glasses?

White was interviewed as to his activities before and during his part in locating the victims the night before. White stated at approximately 1855 hours 9/27/69 he was on routine patrol around the Lake Berryessa area when he received a call from Park Headquarters to proceed to the Rancho Monticello Resort where a person was reporting a possible stabbing. 
White stated he proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort where he was contacted by ARCHIE E. WHITE, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG. RONALD FONG advised him that he had seen a male and a female victim on the beach area south of Rancho Monticello Resort, hollering that they had been stabbed. Ranger Sgt. White, accompanied by ARCHIE WHITE, ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the beach area via speedboat owned by ARCHIE WHITE. When they arrived on the beach they observed a young female lying on the ground with what appeared to be numerous stab wounds. Ranger Sgt. White stated that the female appeared to be in a great deal of pain. White stated as they discovered the female victim, Ranger Dennis Land arrived at the scene in his pickup truck, carrying a male victim who also appeared to have numerous stab wounds. White stated he immediately radioed in and had Park Headquarters call the Sheriff's Office to dispatch an ambulance and a Deputy. White stated he attempted to interview both the boy and girl victims while awaiting arrival of the ambulance. According to White, the male victim said that a male subject approached them, wearing a hood, dressed in dark clothing. The subject was carrying what appeared to be an automatic pistol and stated that he wanted their money and car keys. According to White, the male victim related to him that the subject advised him he was an ex-con out of Colorado and was en route to Mexico. Suspect stated he had to tie them up, and after they were tied the responsible stated, ""I'm going to have to stab you."" White further related that the male victim advised the responsible, ""Stab me first, I can't stand to see her stabbed first."" The male victim then advised that the responsible stabbed him numerous times in the back and then stabbed the girl.
The female victim advised White that she could not see the responsible's face as a hood was covering all of his head. She also advised White that the suspect had what appeared to be clip-on sunglasses to cover his eyes. Ranger Sgt. White stated that this is the most he could get out of either victim as they were both in great shock and pain. White stated that he noticed a lot of blood near the girl's groin area. The interview with Ranger Sgt. White was terminated at that point.

He lives at the Resort. 
Also interviewed were MR. WHITE's wife, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE. MR. and MRS. WHITE advised that they were contacted by RONALD FONG who advised them he had just observed what appeared to be a male and a female subject lying on the beach south of the Rancho Monticello Resort, covered with blood.

William White arrived at the Resort a short time later. MR. and MRS. WHITE, accompanied by Ranger Sgt. Bill White and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the scene area in one of MR. WHITE's ski boats. When they arrived on the scene, they observed a young female wearing a sweater dress lying on the beach, covered with blood. When they approached the area she was on her elbows and knees, rocking back and forth as if in great pain. MRS. WHITE stated she immediately attempted to make the victim more comfortable and tried to calm her down until the ambulance arrived. MRS. WHITE stated the girl advised him, ""He was a man with a hood... His face was covered... He was wearing black pants... It hurts, it hurts."" MRS. WHITE then advised after the female had regained her composure, she told her the man had asked for money but didn't take any. She said she hadn't been raped. MRS. WHITE further advised that the female victim told her that the responsible was wearing glasses, with dark clip-on sunglasses over the hood. She told her that the responsible had a black pistol. MR.

MR. BYRD advised that MISS JUDY was a student at the college and had left the college earlier in the afternoon, driving a yellow Datsun. At 2135 hours Reporting Officers put out an All Points Bulletin around the City and County of Napa for this above described vehicle. At 2137 hours Officers received permission to interview the victim BRYAN HARTNELL who was taken to the X-Ray Room for x-rays. Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Lonergan attempted to interview BRYAN HARTNELL while in the presence of DONALD JUDAH and hospital attendant CLIFFORD MEAGHER. Sgt. Narlow was called away to answer a phone before the interview got under way. HARTNELL appeared to be in extreme pain and also appeared to be in shock. Reporting Officer Lonergan introduced himself to HARTNELL and asked him to give us any information he had on his assailant. HARTNELL stated that the assailant was wearing a black ceremonial type hood, square on top, and appeared to be heavy-set, between 200 and 250 pounds. He also stated his assailant had approached both him and MISS SHEPARD with a gun but had stabbed them with a long knife. HARTNELL further stated the gun was in a black holster and the knife was in a sheath. He stated that the attacker was wearing dark clothing, dark jacket and dark pants. HARTNELL further stated that the gun was an automatic pistol and the knife had a black handle and appeared to be homemade.
It should be noted that HARTNELL was very groggy and he was very difficult to interview at that time. Subject was re-interviewed the next day by Det/Sgt. Robertson and gave more complete details. (The report of Sgt. Robertson's interview is attached.)
At 2215 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan left the Queen of the Valley Hospital after advising Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and William Munk to take charge of the clothing of the victims and any other evidence from the victims when it was released from the hospital. Munk and Brambrink were also advised to stand by at the hospital as a security measure until other arrangements could be made.
As Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan were arriving at the Napa County Sheriff's Office, they were advised by the Napa Police Department that they had located MISS JUDY in the downtown Napa area and were bringing her to the Napa County Sheriff's Office. MISS [JUDY] was interviewed by Lonergan and Narlow at the Napa County Sheriff's Office. She was further identified as MISS JUDITH, a student at Pacific Union College, with a permanent residence address of Sun Valley, California. MISS [JUDITH] advised that she was with BRYAN

HARTNELL and CECELIA SHEPARD earlier in the afternoon. She stated that they all left Pacific Union College together at approximately 1:00 P.M. and went to a rummage sale in the City of St. Helena. She stated that BRYAN had bought a T.V. set at the rummage sale and had to transport it back to his room at Pacific Union College. She stated he left CECELIA at the rummage sale as there was not enough room in his car. MISS [JUDITH] stated BRYAN returned to the St. Helena area and picked up CECELIA at approximately 2:00 P.M. MISS [JUDITH] stated as far as she knew, both BRYAN and CECELIA were planning to go to San Francisco when they left her in St. Helena. MISS [JUDITH] stated she had no knowledge of any plans that BRYAN and CECELIA were making to go to the Lake Berryessa area. MISS [JUDITH] stated the last time she saw BRYAN and CECELIA was approximately 2:00 P.M. in the afternoon.
The interview with MISS [JUDITH] was terminated at that point.
Det/Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow then proceeded to Lake Berryessa and arrived at the scene of the crime, which was approximately a mile and a half north of Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters, at 2354 hours. The scene was being preserved by uniformed officers and under the direct control of Deputy Sheriffs David Collins and Ray Land. The investigating officers were briefed by Officers Collins and Land as to what had taken place prior to our arrival. Officers observed a 1956 white Kharman Ghia with a black vinyl top, Oregon license plate 4 U 2040. Investigating officers were shown footprints in dirt area and tire tracks, both believed to have been left by responsible. Investigating officers awaited the arrival of Sgt. Tom Butler who had been called to take photographs of the crime scene area and Sgt. Hal Snook, criminalist for collection and preservation of physical evidence. R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were advised by Park Ranger Dennis Land who had also arrived at the scene that it was possible to get to the beach area by vehicle from a locked gate approximately one-half mile south of the victim's vehicle. Officers proceeded to the area and arrived at the footpath approximately halfway between the scene of the crime at the beach and the victim's vehicle on the road. At that point, after a brief examination of the footpath area, officers discovered a similar footprint on the footpath to that found at the scene of the victim's vehicle. At that point, due to the lateness and darkness of the hour, Reporting Officers decided to completely secure the area and make a thorough search of the scene at first light. Officers then exited the crime scene area in the same manner and locked the aforementioned gate leading to this vicinity. Investigating officers along with Park Ranger Dennis Land went to the Berryessa Park Headquarters.

took into his possession certain items belonging to the victims that were taken into evidence by Ranger Dennis Land. These items consisted of a blanket, a pair of man's shoes, a wallet belonging to BRYAN HARTNELL, eyeglasses, and playing cards. Among the various aforementioned items believed to belong to the victims, were numerous strands of white plastic line cut into various assorted lengths, some of which had what appeared to be bloodstains. These items were subsequently turned over to Det/Sgt. Hal Snook for preservation.
Assigned investigators then proceeded back to the scene where the victim's car was parked and assisted Sgt. Snook in the making of the plaster casts. At approximately 0245 hours Sgt. Lonergan, having previously obtained the keys to the vehicle from BRYAN HARTNELL's property at Queen of the Valley Hospital, drove the white Kharman Ghia to the maintenance shop at Berryessa Park Headquarters. The vehicle was parked inside of the maintenance shop building and the building was secured for the evening by investigating officers with the assistance of Park Ranger Dennis Land. Assigned Investigators then returned back to the scene where the victim's vehicle had been previously parked and awaited the arrival of Deputy Sheriffs Allen Brambrink and Mel Fechter who were assigned to security duty in the crime scene area. At approximately 0300 hours officers assumed their duties at the crime scene area and the security was placed under the direction of Deputy Allen Brambrink. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then returned to their respective residences with plans to continue the investigation at daybreak.
9/28/69 0700 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene at Lake Berryessa area, accompanied by Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Capt. Donald Townsend, and Sgt. James Munk. Officers then assisted Det/Sgt. Snook in tracking the footprints from the vehicle to the scene of the crime by the beach area. (The location and preservation of aforementioned footprints will be detailed in a supplementary evidence report by Sgt. Snook.)
At 0800 hours Reporting Officers Lonergan and Narlow received information via Park Headquarters that a DR. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his son would like to talk to them at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop regarding a possible suspect in this crime. At 0912 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan contacted DR. R. CLIFTON RAYFIELD and his 16-yr. old son DAVID LEE RAYFIELD at the Spanish Flat Coffee Shop. DR. RAYFIELD gave a home address of Los Gatos, California. DR. RAYFIELD stated that about 6:30 P.M. the previous evening he and his son had parked their car north of Park Headquarters in the general area of the

crime scene. They stated they went down towards the beach area when DAVID RAYFIELD noticed a white male adult subject walking in the area, described as about 5'10"", heavy build, wearing dark trousers, a dark shirt with red in it, long sleeves. He stated this subject was carrying nothing in his hands and was apparently just walking alongside the hill area about halfway between the road and the lake. DAVID further stated that when the subject observed him he turned around and walked up the hill in a southerly direction. DR. RAYFIELD and his son stated that they did not notice a vehicle in the area of their vehicle and only this subject at a distance of about 100 yards. They also advised there was a man with two young boys in the area shooting B-B guns, but they did not know if this man saw the subject or not. This location was approximately 8/10ths of a mile from the scene of the victim's vehicle. In the opinion of R/Os, it is unlikely, unless this male subject had a vehicle in the immediate area, he could have traversed the area to the scene of the crime on foot. There are four coves of water between the scene of the crime and the area where the doctor saw the subject. The interview with DR. RAYFIELD and his son was terminated at that point.
At 1000 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan returned to the scene of the crime and further assisted Sgt. Snook in the collecting and locating of evidence.
At 1320 hours 9/28/69, R/Os interviewed Ranger Sgt. William White at Lake Berryessa Park Headquarters. White was interviewed as to his activities before and during his part in locating the victims the night before. White stated at approximately 1855 hours 9/27/69 he was on routine patrol around the Lake Berryessa area when he received a call from Park Headquarters to proceed to the Rancho Monticello Resort where a person was reporting a possible stabbing. 
White stated he proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort where he was contacted by ARCHIE E. WHITE, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG. RONALD FONG advised him that he had seen a male and a female victim on the beach area south of Rancho Monticello Resort, hollering that they had been stabbed. Ranger Sgt. White, accompanied by ARCHIE WHITE, ELIZABETH WHITE, and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the beach area via speedboat owned by ARCHIE WHITE. When they arrived on the beach they observed a young female lying on the ground with what appeared to be numerous stab wounds. Ranger Sgt. White stated that the female appeared to be in a great deal of pain. White stated as they discovered the female victim, Ranger Dennis Land arrived at the scene in his pickup truck, carrying a male victim who also appeared to have numerous stab wounds. White stated he immediately radioed in and had Park Headquarters call the Sheriff's Office to dispatch an ambulance and a Deputy. White stated he attempted to interview both the boy and girl victims while awaiting

arrival of the ambulance. According to White, the male victim said that a male subject approached them, wearing a hood, dressed in dark clothing. The subject was carrying what appeared to be an automatic pistol and stated that he wanted their money and car keys. According to White, the male victim related to him that the subject advised him he was an ex-con out of Colorado and was en route to Mexico. Suspect stated he had to tie them up, and after they were tied the responsible stated, ""I'm going to have to stab you."" White further related that the male victim advised the responsible, ""Stab me first, I can't stand to see her stabbed first."" The male victim then advised that the responsible stabbed him numerous times in the back and then stabbed the girl.
The female victim advised White that she could not see the responsible's face as a hood was covering all of his head. She also advised White that the suspect had what appeared to be clip-on sunglasses to cover his eyes. Ranger Sgt. White stated that this is the most he could get out of either victim as they were both in great shock and pain. White stated that he noticed a lot of blood near the girl's groin area. The interview with Ranger Sgt. White was terminated at that point.
9/28/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers proceeded to the Rancho Monticello Resort and interviewed MR. ARCHIE E. WHITE. (It should be noted that ARCHIE E. WHITE and ELIZABETH WHITE are no relation to Ranger Sgt. White.) ARCHIE E. WHITE is the owner of the Boat Repair Shop at Rancho Monticello Resort. He lives at the Resort. Also interviewed were MR. WHITE's wife, MRS. ELIZABETH WHITE. MR. and MRS. WHITE advised that they were contacted by RONALD FONG who advised them he had just observed what appeared to be a male and a female subject lying on the beach south of the Rancho Monticello Resort, covered with blood. FONG advised them that the couple had shouted out to him that they had been stabbed and robbed. MRS. WHITE immediately called Park Headquarters and Ranger Sgt. William White arrived at the Resort a short time later. MR. and MRS. WHITE, accompanied by Ranger Sgt. Bill White and RONALD FONG, proceeded to the scene area in one of MR. WHITE's ski boats. When they arrived on the scene, they observed a young female wearing a sweater dress lying on the beach, covered with blood. When they approached the area she was on her elbows and knees, rocking back and forth as if in great pain. MRS. WHITE stated she immediately attempted to make the victim more comfortable and tried to calm her down until the ambulance arrived. MRS. WHITE stated the girl advised him, ""He was a man with a hood... His face was covered... He was wearing black pants... It hurts, it

hurts."" MRS. WHITE then advised after the female had regained her composure, she told her the man had asked for money but didn't take any. She said she hadn't been raped. MRS. WHITE further advised that the female victim told her that the responsible was wearing glasses, with dark clip-on sunglasses over the hood. She told her that the responsible had a black pistol. MR. ARCHIE WHITE stated he overheard the male victim advise someone that the responsible was wearing gloves. MR. and MRS. WHITE further advised that this is the only information either victim gave them on the responsible, and that they spent the balance of the time attempting to make the victim more comfortable until the arrival of the ambulance.
After the interview with MR. and MRS. WHITE, Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan returned to the Napa County Sheriff's Office.
At 1620 hours R/O Det/Sgt. Narlow was contacted by a DEAN of the Pacific Union College in Angwin. DEAN advised that three young ladies, students at the college, might possibly have information as to a suspect in the attack at Lake Berryessa. The young ladies were identified as MISS JOANNE, MISS LINDA, and MISS LINDA. DEAN advised that these girls had been in the Lake Berryessa area from about 3:00 P.M. to 4:30 P.M. the previous Saturday afternoon. They had observed a male subject in a late model, silver blue Chevrolet, two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. DEAN advised that the girls had told him they were observed out of the car by this subject while they were sunbathing on the beach. They described the subject as approximately 40 years old, [blank] feet tall, dressed in dark clothing. Sgt. Narlow dispatched Deputy Sheriff Raymond Land to interview these three girls that evening. (The report of Land's interview is attached.)
Reporting Officers spent the balance of the day and evening going through their investigative notes and issuing a statewide All Points Bulletin.
Monday, 9/29/69 Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan spent the majority of the morning interviewing numerous citizens and officers from other departments regarding this crime and similar crimes. (A general list of possible suspects was begun and they are noted on separate incident reports as to origin of information and description of suspects, attached.)
Reporting Officers were advised by Deputy Sheriff Ray Land who interviewed the three college girls, MISS [JOANNE], MISS [LINDA], and MISS [LINDA] that the information appeared to have some merit and advised that the three young ladies would be in the office in the afternoon for further interview.

9/29/69 1445 hours The three young ladies came into the office and were interviewed by Sgt. Lonergan, Sgt. Snook, and Capt. Donald Townsend.
Lonergan interviewed a MISS JOANNE MARIE, who, [age] years of age, DOB [blank], her address at the college is 114 Dauphine, Pacific Union College, home address South East 12th, College Place, Washington. MISS [JOANNE] advised R/O that on 9/27/69 at approximately 5:30 P.M. she and her two girlfriends parked their vehicle at a location two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand on Knoxville Road. When they left their car they noticed a subject driving a late model silver blue Chevrolet, 2-door sedan, pull up behind them. What appeared to be a white male adult was sitting in the vehicle. They did not observe this subject leave the vehicle. The girls proceeded to the beach area and were sunbathing in their bikinis. After approximately one-half hour had passed, they observed what appeared to be the same subject standing within 40 or 50 feet of them, apparently observing them. This subject was described as 6' tall, weighing 200/210 lbs., muscular build, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing dark pants and a dark pullover shirt. The subject would stare at the three girls but when they looked up at him he would look away. The subject hung around the area for approximately 45 minutes and then the girls observed him walk up the hill. MISS [JOANNE] stated it was very doubtful that from his vantage point in the vehicle the subject could observe the three girls on the beach. She believes he waited in his vehicle and then followed them down after they were on the beach. MISS [JOANNE] further described the car as appearing very conservative. She stated the car did not appear to belong to any young person such as a teenager. She did state the car had California license plates but did not notice the number.
The other two young ladies, MISS [LINDA] and MISS [LINDA] were interviewed by Sgt. Snook and Capt. Donald Townsend.
MISS LINDA who was interviewed by R/O Det/Sgt. Snook, is a WFA, DOB [blank], home address Sunnyside Road, Sanitarium. She stated she left the Angwin area with two other girls, JOANNE and LINDA at approximately 2:45 P.M. 9/27/69. The girls drove through Pope Valley to Lake Berryessa where they parked their vehicle two miles north of the A & W Root Beer stand. MISS [LINDA] stated she observed a subject go into the parking lot area to the south. Subject went past their vehicle and backed up so their rear bumpers were nearly touching. Vehicle described as a 1966 or 1967 light blue Chevrolet with California plates. Witness believes the vehicle was a 2-door sedan and described the headlights as being long rather than round. The rear window glass was tinted quite dark. Another vehicle from Angwin with Arizona plates was in the parking area and witness saw the occupants, a MISS DENISE BROWN and a MR. WAYNE HAIGHT.

to the beach and shortly thereafter noticed the male subject watching them from the edge of the trees. After about 30 minutes the subject came down by the beach and passed within 20 feet of witness as he walked from south to north. Subject was described by MISS [LINDA] as approximately 28 years of age, 6' to 6'2"" tall, 200/225 lbs., black hair possibly styled, with a part on left, rounded eyes, thin lips, medium nose, straight eyebrows, small ears, well built, rather nice-looking. Subject was wearing a black short-sleeved sweater shirt, bunched up in front, and a white tee shirt hanging out in back, and dark trousers. The three girls left the area about 4:30 P.M. and the subject's vehicle was gone. Witnesses did not observe the subject either leave or get back into his vehicle.
MISS LINDA LEE was interviewed by R/O Capt. Donald Townsend. MISS [LINDA LEE] is a WFA, DOB [blank], address Howell Mountain Road, Angwin. MISS [LINDA LEE] is employed as a secretary of the college press. MISS [LINDA LEE] observed the same vehicle which was described as a late model Chevrolet, sky blue in color. The rear tail lights appeared to be long rather than round. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated they parked their vehicle at approximately 2:55 P.M. and observed the subject in his vehicle at that location. The girls proceeded to the beach and she, MISS [LINDA LEE], again noticed the subject about 30 to 45 minutes after they were at the beach. She noticed him standing on the bank approximately 45 yards from her location. She described the subject as 6 feet tall, stocky build, about 200 lbs., black short-sleeved sweater shirt, dark blue slacks, and straight dark hair neatly combed. She guessed his age at approximately 30 years. Subject had medium color skin and was not wearing glasses. MISS [LINDA LEE] stated she thought she saw a white belt around his back but it possibly was a tee shirt hanging out. She further stated that the man was fairly nice-looking, with a round face. She did not observe the subject leave the area in his vehicle.
9/29/69 - 1600 hours Reporting Officers Sgt. Narlow and Sgt. Lonergan were advised by Capt. Joseph Page that the female victim, MISS CECELIA SHEPARD, had just died at Queen of the Valley Hospital.

Page further advised R/Os that the remains would be removed to Morrison Funeral Home where DR. DE PETRIS would complete the autopsy.
At 1945 hours 9/29/69, R/Os Narlow and Lonergan were contacted by Probation Officer H. B. Schotte. Mr. Schotte had observed the footprint design that R/Os had taken at the scene and stated he had knowledge of a possible similar shoe sole design. Mr. Schotte brought into the office a MR.

Air Force Base and is a Flight Line Mechanic. He is a retired Master Sergeant in the United States Air Force. MR. [BASSEL] showed R/O a pair of Air Force chukker boots that belonged to him. He described these boots as being Government issue, issued to all Air Force personnel at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. They are primarily designed as a wing-walker shoe, however according to MR. [BASSEL] most Air Force personnel and many of the civilian personnel employed at Air Force bases had this type of shoe. The sole design of this shoe exactly matched the plaster cast design that Sgt. Snook had taken at the scene of the crime. It should be noted that Det/Sgt John Robertson had attempted to find a similar shoe design at the local shoe stores in the Napa area with negative results. (Refer Sgt. Robertson's supplementary report.) MR. [BASSEL] was asked if we could keep his shoes for identification purposes and he agreed. R/Os was also advised that this information regarding the type of footprint had not been released to the press or general public. MR. [BASSEL] stated he would cooperate with R/Os and keep this information confidential.
9/30/69, 0810 hours R/O Sgt. Lonergan received a telephone call from MISS MARILYN DENISE, 18 years of age, DOB [blank].

She stated shortly after they parked the vehicle they observed the victims who were known to them, BRYAN HARTNELL and CECELIA SHEPARD, driving south on Knoxville Road in BRYAN's white Kharman Ghia. She stated as the HARTNELL vehicle drove by, BRYAN waved out the window and said, ""Hi, John!"", referring to MR. [JOHN]. MISS [MARILYN] stated that they did not see the HARTNELL vehicle any other time that day.
9/30/69, 0900 hours R/Os Det/Sgt. Narlow and Det/Sgt. Richard Lonergan, accompanied by Sgt. Thomas Butler, proceeded to the Morrison Funeral Home in St. Helena.

advised that the cause of death was shock and loss of blood brought on by two main stab wounds.
9/30/69, 1430 hours R/O Det/Sgt. Kenneth Narlow contacted CAPT. at Travis Air Force Base and arranged for an interview with COL. and SGT. to take place on Wednesday morning, October 1st, 1969, at 9:00 A.M. R/Os wanted to talk to someone at Travis regarding the shoeprints that were found on the scene. The remainder of the day and evening was spent in answering phone calls from people who had possible knowledge of the crime.
Wednesday, 10/1/69 - 0900 hours Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow went to Travis Air Force Base and were present at an interview in Col. office, who is Commanding Officer in charge of base security. Also present at this meeting besides the aforementioned officers was LT. COL. of the Office of Special Investigation. Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan advised the Air Force personnel present of the portion of the evidence we had discovered at the crime scene and asked them for assistance in locating where this type of shoe was sold or issued. LT. COL. advised that his office would assist assigned investigators in attempting to locate the source of the shoe.
Officers were directed to the Base Supply with the assistance of Special Agent DONALD of O.S.I., at which time it was determined through Base Supply that this shoe in question was of Government issue and that it was not kept in stock at Base Supply, however it was believed that the Sales Store had such an item. It was then explained that if a military person or civilian employee was determined to be in need of such an item, he first reported to the Base Supply, at which time he was issued a purchase requisition which he in turn took to the Sales Store and the type of shoe was issued to the individual and they in turn required the individual to sign the purchase requisition showing that he did receive the item. This purchase requisition states the type of shoe that the individual was to receive, however makes no reference as to size.
Assigned investigators, accompanied by Special Agent proceeded to the Sales Store located on Travis Air Force Base. After a short period of time R/Os located in stock a shoe fitting the identical description of the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast which officers had in their possession. The identical shoe with identical tread was found and a shoe bearing the closest measurements in the artist's sketch drawn from the plaster cast was measured and found to be a size 10 1/2 in military styling or a 10 1/2 D in civilian equivalent. It was determined through Air Force records that they were unable to furnish officers with the

data regarding the sales of this type shoe due to the fact that no recordings were made of the specific sizes, however purchase records indicate over the past 13 months approximately 100 pairs of this size shoe, namely 10 1/2, had been purchased and disposed of through sales. Air Force records indicate this type shoe is manufactured by the International Shoe Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, then shipped to Air Force Depot, Ogden, Utah, and from there shipped to the various military installations upon requisition orders.
10/1/69 - 1400 hours Reporting Officers Narlow and Lonergan then proceeded to the Vallejo Police Department and met with Sgt. Jack Mullanax and Sgt. Duane Nilsson. Officers exchanged information regarding Vallejo's crime of 7/4/69 and our particular incident. Suspect information was exchanged and is listed in the separate suspect file.
Investigating Officers checked to determine the validity of the decoded message and as to how far the original cyphers had been decoded. It was then learned that the message had been decoded by at least two different sources, one being by MR. and MRS. HARDIN of Salinas and the other by the FBI in Washington. It was noted that these cyphers were broken independent of one another and the FBI confirmed the validity of the original decoded message. It was also learned that there was a small portion on the very end of the coded message that had not been decoded for reasons unknown.
The balance of the afternoon and evening Reporting Officers and other investigating officers met to exchange information and further discuss the evidence at hand.
Thursday, October 2nd, 1969, 0845 hours Reporting Officer Lonergan received a telephone call from Special Agent, OSI, Travis Air Force Base. Subject called to report that approximately 500 to 1,000 of that type of wing-walker shoe have been sold as surplus on the Base. This would be over and above those sold at the Sales Store. Agent further related he has the names of all the subjects who have purchased this item through surplus and will keep these names available to officers upon request.
The balance of the morning was spent searching fingerprint evidence and answering phone calls from possible witnesses.
Thursday, 10/2/69, 1400 hours R/Os Narlow and Lonergan attended the funeral services for victim CECELIA SHEPARD. These services were held at the Pacific Union College Church, Angwin, California. Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan positioned themselves

inside the church in order to observe all persons who viewed the services and the remains of victim CECELIA SHEPARD. Det/Sgt. Harold Snook, Sgt. Thomas Butler, and Detective Ronald Montgomery of the Napa Police Department positioned themselves outside the church and photographed all persons entering and leaving the services. This included individual photographs and group scenes. Sgts. Lonergan and Narlow also attended the graveside services at the St. Helena Cemetery in St. Helena.
Friday, 10/3/69 - Reporting Officer Det/Sgt. Richard Lonergan contacted JAMES, Napa State Hospital, advised him to set up an interview with a patient who is a possible suspect in our case. The patient is identified as GRIFFIN RAYMOND FRANKLIN, WMA, 20 yrs. of age, DOB [blank], 6'2"", 223 lbs. [JAMES] had previously reported that this subject had left the hospital on a pass Friday evening, 9/26/69, and returned to the hospital Monday afternoon, 9/29/69. This subject also had spent time in the Air Force and was discharged from the Air Force in January 1969 for psychiatric problems. According to the doctors at the hospital, this subject was capable of committing this type of a crime. R/O in the presence of JAMES and Security Officer PHIL RYAN interviewed subject FRANKLIN. FRANKLIN was very cooperative and talkative to R/O and went over his activities the prior weekend. Briefly stated, MR. FRANKLIN, whose parents live in Vallejo, never left the Vallejo area that weekend and stayed around home talking with his mother, stepfather, and three brothers. After interviewing subject, it was the opinion of R/O Sgt. Lonergan that this subject was not the responsible. He had a definite very fast manner of speaking which was completely opposed to the victim's statement concerning the suspect's voice. R/O also contacted the mother of the suspect, a MRS. OPAL at Hollywood Avenue, Vallejo. MRS. OPAL stated more or less the exact same thing that her son had stated as to his whereabouts that weekend. It appears that this subject has a reliable alibi as to his activities and had no access to a vehicle that weekend. This subject was cleared as far as this crime is concerned.
The balance of the morning and afternoon was spent by R/Os Det/Sgts. Narlow and Lonergan going over physical evidence and dictating reports.

9/28/69 12:30 P.M. Reporting Officer John Robertson, Det/Sgt., interviewed one of two victims who were each stabbed numerous times by an unknown assailant. Victim CECELIA SHEPARD and victim BRYAN HARTNELL both had been placed in the Queen of the Valley Hospital intensive care unit. Victim SHEPARD had surgery performed on her earlier in the morning (9/28/69) and was unable to be questioned by the Reporting Officer, however Dr. Ludwig gave permission for victim HARTNELL to be interviewed.
Although victim HARTNELL was heavily sedated, he was able to give R/O a verbal statement. (Note: R/O taped electrically the interview with victim HARTNELL.) Victim HARTNELL related the following.
He had known CECELIA SHEPARD for some time, they were good friends, and she had come to the Napa County area to spend the weekend. She and a female companion, DALORA LEE, Aspen, Loma Linda, San Bernardino County, Calif. (phone Ext. 2155) had driven from Southern California and were to drive back Sunday, 9/28/69. Victim stated he and MISS SHEPARD drove to Lake Berryessa, picked a large tree near the shore line where they decided to lie down and enjoy the scenery. While lying on the ground, victim HARTNELL stated he heard a noise and asked MISS SHEPARD if she could hear anything or see anything behind a tree not far from where the couple were lying. MISS SHEPARD told victim HARTNELL she could see a man behind the tree. HARTNELL asked her what he was doing. MISS SHEPARD stated she couldn't tell. HARTNELL stated he (suspect) then came from behind the tree. MISS SHEPARD said, ""Oh my God, he has a gun!""
Victim HARTNELL stated the man approached the couple, aiming a black steel automatic pistol. The suspect stated he needed a car and money. Suspect stated his car was ""hot"" and he wanted victim HARTNELL's car keys. Victim HARTNELL stated he began talking with the suspect, telling the suspect he had no money, only a small amount of change, also that if the suspect was really in need of assistance HARTNELL would attempt to help him. The suspect told victim to get on the ground. Suspect then had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him. HARTNELL stated he attempted to keep the suspect engaged in conversation while suspect was tying the victims.
HARTNELL further stated the suspect was described as follows: Wearing a black hooded mask (cloth), covering suspect's entire head and shoulders, coming down almost to suspect's waist. Victim stated on front of the four-cornered type mask (similar to paper bag in style) there was a symbol, the symbol described as white, approximately 3 x 3 inches in diameter, with a symmetrical cross. Also on the eyelets of the mask was a pair of clip-on sunglasses, the glasses clipped to the eyelets. Victim stated he could also see hair through the mask's eyelets and observed the hair to be dark brown.
Victim stated suspect was wearing a light-weight windbreaker, dark blue or black, pleated slacks (old-fashioned type). Victim could not remember what type of shoes or anything about suspect's hands, could not remember if suspect was wearing gloves.
Victim thought suspect was possibly 20 to 30 years of age by voice concept. Victim stated suspect was 5'8"" to 6', 225-250 lbs., dark brown hair, eyes unknown, sloppy dresser, stomach hanging over trousers. Suspect spoke with some

type of drawl, but victim stated it was not a Southern drawl, did not really know what type of drawl, but thought the man was not well educated, but did not feel he was illiterate either. Victim said suspect's voice was moderate in sound, that is, not high or low pitched.
Suspect told victim he was sent to (?) Lodge State Prison (possibly Deer Lodge State Prison), Montana, for a killing. While there (in prison) he killed a guard while escaping. Suspect also told victims he was heading for Mexico, told victim he was flat broke.
Victim observed cut-up rope in suspect's rear pocket (trouser's), also stated he was wearing a knife in a case (on belt) on his right side, near front of trousers. Knife description: Appeared to be a long bread knife, 12"" long blade, 3/4"" wide, hardwood handle, 2 brass rivets holding handle in place, cotton surgical tape wrapped approximately 1"" around handle of knife. Knife case possibly made of wood.
Victim asked suspect if suspect's gun was loaded. Suspect removed magazine from handle of pistol and showed victim a bullet removed from gun, bullet described as a possible .45 caliber. Victim did not know what caliber the pistol was.
Suspect had MISS SHEPARD tie HARTNELL's hands behind him, suspect then tied victim SHEPARD's hands, then re-tied HARTNELL's hands, then tied both victims' ankles together, had victims lie on their stomachs. HARTNELL stated suspect said, ""I'm getting nervous."" This was when suspect was tying MISS SHEPARD'S hands, in fact HARTNELL stated suspect got real shaky when he was tying MISS SHEPARD's hands.
Victim HARTNELL then stated that without warning the suspect plunged his knife into the back of HARTNELL. Suspect did this repeatedly, HARTNELL stated he thinks six times.

Victim stated the boat left the area and he (victim) attempted to get help by crawling and walking to the road. (Victim believed he had walked to the road, however had not gone too far from his wounded companion.)
Victim stated he thought suspect had been with the couple for approximately fifteen (15) minutes from time of observing suspect until suspect departed. Victim stated suspect did not take his wallet, although when MISS SHEPARD was tying victim HARTNELL's hands, she reached in his pocket and threw his wallet to suspect. Suspect did not take the wallet or victim's car keys.
Victim stated a man in a pickup truck found him on the road and called an ambulance. Victim stated he estimated one hour in time was involved between the time he and MISS SHEPARD were stabbed until help arrived.

Sgt. ROBERTSON stated that Mr. HARTNELL was heavily sedated but was able to give a verbal statement pertaining to the attack at Lake Berrysessa. The interview was taped and reads as follows:
""INTERVIEW OF JOHN ROBERTSON, DET/SGT., NAPA COUNTY SHERIFF's DEPARTMENT, WITH BRYAN CALVIN HARTNELL (NSO CASE #105907) AT QUEEN OF THE VALLEY HOSPITAL ON SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1969 (TRANSCRIBED FROM TAPE RECORDING BY M. FEURLE):
""J.R. Can you give me this fellow's description and tell me what happened?
""B.H. So many people have been asking me... I hope...
""J.R. Well sometimes when we're repetitious, I know it happens to me, I tell the same thing over and over and over, and sometimes I might vary a little, and if you do...
""B.H. Shall I just start out and tell you what happened?
""J.R. I don't want to tire you out.
""B.H. I just don't want this to happen again to anybody... Of course he might have his reasons, I don't know...
""J.R. Okay. Go right ahead. Start right from the beginning. What happened?
""B.H. Okay. This girl came out from school, I used to go with her two years ago, and she's now going to another school, and she came up to visit some friends and we were having dinner at the school cafeteria, and I said, 'Well, are you doing anything special this afternoon?' and she said, 'Why?', and I said, 'I don't know. We could go out and either go for a walk, go to San Francisco, or, you know, just...', 'cause we used to be good friends. We used to have a good friendship. And so it got too late by the time we got around to what we were going to do. We had to stop in St. Helena for a couple items and then we had to cart a couple kids home and stuff, and by the time we finally got around to it, it was getting late, and I thought going to San Francisco 'd rush you, you know, because by the time we got back for worship... And so we went out to Berryessa, and there was this one place I used to go out... we used to all the time, you know... and I couldn't find it. And so I figured Ah, forget it, and this looks like as good a place as any. So I parked the car, there were no other cars there. I had a Kharman Ghia, '56, white, with a black vinyl top, and it's in pretty

... ""good-looking shape. But we parked there on the road's edge and we talked Oh it must be about a quarter of a mile to down to the place where we went. We had... (unintelligible) peninsula, it's an an island I guess during the wetter season, You can see where it was levee... And so that looked like a lot... there was a big spreading tree up there. There were two of them, really, one was a little bigger than the other. We took the one that was out on the point.
""It was really beautiful out there. We were sitting on top... I lay down on my back and she lay down on her stomach beside me, you know, kind of resting her head on my shoulder, and we were talking, you know, kind of reminiscing about old times, and stuff. And I heard these rustling leaves, and I said, 'You have your specs on. Why don't you see what the deal is over there?' And she says, 'Oh, it's some man.' And I said, 'Is he alone?' and she said, 'Yeah... (unintelligible)...' and she says, 'Well he just stepped behind the tree.' And I said, 'What's the idea of that? To take a leak?' You know, 'cause that's the only thing I could think of, just step behind a tree. And so I says, 'Well, keep looking and tell me what happens,' and she says, 'Oh my God, he's got a gun!' and squeezed my arm and
""And so he came out, and of course still actually I wasn't... There's some things you really wouldn't mind having happen, just for the experience of it. You know I thought, Well I only got fifty cents on me. It's worth all of that having it happen. I didn't think about another angle. So I talked to him, you know. I said, 'Well listen, Mac, (you know I'm in the sociologist field, you know, I'm pre-law, with history and psych.) You know I've read about the criminal mind and everything, you know. I thought well maybe the guy really does need help, you know. I says, 'There's no strings attached.' I says, 'I don't have any money right now but if you need help that badly I can help you out in another way maybe.' And he says, 'Nah.. time's running short,' he says, ''cause I just got out of... some prison in Montana, I don't know what the name of it is. Feathers? Do you know what the name of it is? I'll see if it sounds familiar. Fern or Feathers? It's some double name, like Fern Lock or something...
""J.R. It's Lodge..

""B.H. Oh yeah, yeah, Lodge. At least we know we're together on that.
""J.R. Mountain Lodge Prison, or something of that nature...
""B.H. Yeah. You know he said he broke out and had to kill a guard getting out. And I said, 'Well, man, I mean actually I don't mean to call your bluff or anything, but wouldn't you rather be stuck on a stealing charge than a threat of homicide?' you know? And he says, 'Well just don't start playing hero on me.' You know, 'Don't try to grab the gun,' 'cause I didn't really figure the gun was loaded. I always thought it would be empty. I've heard a lot of times that this is what they do just as a bluff, but I decided not to call his bluff after he really, you know... I told him, 'You know you're really wasting your time with me. I've got a billfold and this much change and that's it.' And he said, he told the girl, 'Go tie him up. I'd feel much better if you were tied up.' And she tied a couple of loose knots on me, so I made it look kind of tight... (unintelligible)... you know, just for a second, and he said 'Go ahead.' And I whispered to her, 'You know I think I can get that gun.' And I said, 'Do you mind?' and she got kind of fearful about it, so I figured since there's two lives involved, not just mine, I won't do it.
""So I let her tie me up on the wrists again, and he tied her up, - terribly tight, you know, real... (unintelligible) ... put his gun away, and we were talking and all, bantering, you know, basically. I was thinking, anything I can do to help, by the way just to keep the conversation going... Suddenly he was taking it all seriously, you know... So I was starting out and finally he said, 'Okay, lay down. I've got her tied up', you know... He strung a rope between our ankles in the rear, so we were like this, you know, on our stomachs, tied...
""J.R. You both facing the ground...
""B.H. Right. And, oh, this was before. I got sort of ahead. So anyway, he said, 'Get down,' and I said, 'Oh come on! We could freeze to death!' I said that a couple, three times, and he said, 'GET DOWN! RIGHT NOW!' He got a little pushed off at me. So I got down and then he finished tying her up and clonked her down, - and then he goes... Sswhooosh (a sound with his mouth)... (unintelligible)

""And so I said, 'Do you have bullets in there?' And so he pulled out the clip and showed me that he did. The bullets were about this long, I can remember, and about this fat, and they had the regular red cap on it, about this long. Maybe that doesn't give you any better description of the gun or not. I don't know. And it came out of the heel, the grip, you know. It slipped out from the bottom.
""And now, to backtrack a bit. I was really trying to see what he looked like, you know. He had on pleated pants, these old type of suit pants, you know, and they were either black or dark blue, I can't remember now. And I can't remember what he was wearing for shoes. But he had on this cotton coat, You've seen the kind, that you just turn the collar up once, there's a zipper down the front, you know. They're real light, super-thin, you know...
""J.R. Kind of a windbreaker...
""B.H. Yeah, like a windbreaker. And it's got this blue, this little collar, sometimes the guys wear them standing up, you know.
""J.R. What color was that?
""B.H. That was dark blue. And I don't know. Maybe he had something in his pouch. I just took it as being a... as being a... you know, he was stout 'cause he looked kind of heavy. I think he was weighing two and a quarter, two fifty, somewhere in there. And I got kind of a look at his hair. His voice... I can remember... almost like I'd heard it before. You know there's some drawls that a lot of people have similar. And... almost as if I'd heard it before... couldn't think where.
""I gave that one up, I just gave it up on that angle. I looked through his hair. I kind of looked like it was combed, you know, like this.. it was a brownish, you know, dark brown hair.
""And this mask he had on. It was ingeniously devised. It was... he had four corners at the top, like the top of a paper sack... black. It came down, came down, with the front panel about to here, and a kind of a thing that came over the shoulders, you know, and then the same thing down the back, straight down. And in the front he had a circle with a symmetrical cross in the middle. You know what I mean by a symmetrical cross?

Case INV 1-15-311-F9-5861
""J.R. Um hum (affirmative).
""B.H. The ends of the cross hung out about this far on each of the... you know, where it came out. The circle was this much... like this... and then it was like this, you see... hung out on the end, over the edge of the circle.
""And he had clip-on sunglasses... it was hard to tell. You know, the sunglasses you clip on when you're wearing glasses, eyeglasses, He had those clipped on. I'm pretty sure... I don't think he had glasses, though. I think he just had these clipped on to his suit... you know, that little mask.
""And I don't know how tall he was. Maybe 5-8 or maybe 5-10, 6 feet, somewhere in there. I'm a very poor judge of height because of my height. I have no meaning, you know. It's always down, you know. It can never be up...
""And so I saw him put away his gun, and I was turning to say something to Celia, and all of a sudden I felt my back... just... no, I think I saw him pull it out.. I don't remember... I think I saw him whip out his knife and just start stabbing me in the back... CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP! I was just (makes a gutteral sound)... you know that kind of a sound... and Celia turned to see why I was (repeats gutteral sound), you know, and she just about fainted. She went hysterical... (unintelligible) ... and when he finally stopped... I mean he went over and... The doctor says there's six in the back, six wounds on my back. You ought to confirm that. One I've got went clear through the lung. I've got it draining. I did drain a couple pints of blood out as soon as I got here. I lost an awful lot of blood, I guess.
""We were down... I mean it was absolutely no question in my mind... when a person gets stabbed as many times as we did... we were going to die. I mean there'd be no reason to question it. But somehow I, you know, started (unintelligible)... I just knew there was too much I had to live for. I mean really it does happen... about getting depressed and everything... when you're young you always think about these things... you know you think about it... and when you've got someone forcing your hand, oh well, there was a lot of things I had to do. And what really kept me going... you know my parents are pretty Christian. I haven't been too much of a Christian myself... but if you believe in the principle you ask God to help you. Another thing, What was my only strength was knowing two things. One, that I did not want to die, and two, that I felt that whatever was

""going to be was going to be, but I was going to try my damnedest to stay alive. And so, like I say, - before I left her I kissed her, and I said, 'Well,' I says, 'I'm gonna try to get help.'
""There was a boat kept circling around out there in the lake and we started yelling at it and finally it came within about 100 yards of the shore and turned off its motor and stayed there watching us for about fifteen minutes, and we were just screaming hysterically, trying to get their attention, you know, to come over here. Oh, I don't know, I guess they were afraid that the guy might be there in the bushes and they were liable to get choked or something. So finally he came up a little closer. I didn't have my glasses on... I was just swaying, you know... and I had gotten one of her hands free before they came, and so I kept trying to get her to untie me, and she couldn't, she was too weak, she said.
""So finally I just kept hollering and hollering, and she said, 'Turn around and let's see if I can do it again.' She finally got it. My hands and my feet were just pure numbness... they're still numb but I'm sure that will go 'way. But I finally got... (unintelligible)... untie her so she could kind of relax out. 'Cause it was a terrible position, you know, upon our stomachs... (unintelligible)...
""And so I started to go for help. I finally got myself fairly reconciled. I wasn't too worried about dying, if that was what was going to happen, but I knew I had to keep pushing on. I had to force myself into staying alive because it was... I could just see myself... you know, all sort of waves would come over... I just (coughing sound)... (unintelligible)... 'Well, you're not gonna give up this easy', you know. And, like I say, I just kept believing that God would do everything the best, if the thing was gonna happen, but I couldn't see any reason why my dying would be the best good. So I just played along with that.
""I just started to walk toward the road... everything blacked out on me... my visual... my mind was never blacked out, but my visual was. So I lay down... My eyes started to come open... I just saw a haze of trees, you know. In a little while I got up and went another twenty feet, and then the same thing happened... (unintelligible)... and sat down. Next thing I went clear... (unintelligible)... the road, and by that time I just fell... I just... I was trying so hard to go far I just went too far. Finally I heard this pickup

""coming... I was just laying alongside the road, and that's where this guy picked me up.
""They weren't in any hurry at all, it didn't seem like, you know, but they finally called an ambulance. About fifteen minutes later it came... (unintelligible)... but I still believe... I've got feeling... starting to get a little pain to come through. But from the minute that knife blade went in, it was nothing but pure shock from there on. I just did not expect it. I didn't expect that he would do that. That was a variable I had completely left out. And I guess he just took off running after we started running. I don't know. I never saw him before and hope not to see him again... at least outside of a courtroom.
""It's hard for me to explain much more. I mean I'm trying to give you a kind of example of his technique. He had some rope cut up in his back pocket. And he had a ... well, I thought it was a police automatic because it was in one of these black leather cases, you know...
""J.R. Was it in a smooth case, or did it have a basket weave like..
""B.H. Can I have my glasses? Oh, they're not here. It was a smooth one, though.
""J.R. Did he have this hood down to about the middle of his chest?
""B.H. No, about like... well, I'll show you... Here... his stomach.. You know I could see his... (voice fades away)
""J.R. Okay. You said his hair looked dark brown. How could you see his hair?
""B.H. 'Cause I saw it from where those goggles fit. I looked so closely to find out. And when he turned you know they kind of flittered... I could see his hair. It looked kind of greasy.
""J.R. Now was he as heavy as I am?
""B.H. Well I can't say 'cause he wasn't wearing those type of clothes. They were sloppy clothes, you know. And he just had on this old pair of pleated pants. I don't know... How tall are you?
""J.R. I'm about five eleven.

(Interview of HARTNELL cont'd.)
Case INV 1-15-311-F9-5861
""B.H. Well, like I say, he was dressed kind of sloppily, you know. His pants real tight up here and his stomach kind of pouched a bit, you know. I don't know... it's hard to say 'cause I can't judge you with being in a suit and all, you know, and him not being professional-looking at all. He could be about the same. It's hard to say. He was so sloppily dressed.
""J.R. Bryan, you also mentioned a drawl. Well not a drawl, an accent.
""B.H. It was just something... I guess his way of talking. It was something I couldn't repeat. It's like a song. Sometimes you know what you're going to say but you just can't sing the melody worth a darn.
""J.R. Did he have a throaty voice or a high pitched?
""B.H. In between. But it was just a unique way of talking.
""J.R. Did he sound like an educated man?
""B.H. Heck no! I don't think so.
""J.R. Did he sound illiterate?
""B.H. No. He didn't sound that way either. He just impressed me as being rather low class. The reason was because of his clothes, you know.
""J.R. Did you lose consciousness when he stabbed you at any time? Did you observe him stab Cecelia?
""B.H. Yeah...
""J.R. What did he say after...
""B.H. He stabbed her a bunch of times in the back. After she turned around, he got her once in the groin and one in the arm I think. He kind of went a little more hog-wild with her than with me. I faked dead... like that... I didn't want him to come back and give me some more.
""J.R. So you were pretty sure he thought you were dead when he finished working on you?

""B.H. I think he kind of thought that. Of course I don't know because we started talking right after he left. It's hard to say... (unintelligible)... I don't think she fainted either.
""J.R. Was she in a lot of pain, did she tell you?
""B.H. Oh yeah. She was more weak at the time... (unintelligible).. from the religious angle. I told her I sure as heck wasn't going to have any deathbed conversion. 'No,' she says... (unintelligible)... I mean it was just like you were gonna die and had a few things to say. But I felt more and more I wasn't losing strength as much... (unintelligible)... that I thought I could cope with...
""J.R. What you did was a courageous thing. It was a terrible thing to have happen to anyone.
""B.H. Well there was nothing we could do. We were kind of at the mercy of him. I mean I wanted to get that gun... (unintelligible)... There was a time I think I could have gotten it...
""J.R. Did it appear to be a .45 to you? An automatic?
""B.H. It was about this long... along the stock... and had a wood edge on it, you know.. on either side...
""J.R. Handles.
""B.H. Yeah...yeah...
""J.R. Did the bullet look anything like that?
""B.H. No. It was kind of like this, only it was gold, and this part here came out along with this and then round the gold, round the blunt end. Not quite that blunt-ended, though.
""J.R. Was it fat? Fatter than this?
""B.H. Yeah, I think it was a little fatter. But it was gold, you know. And I didn't see any of this here. There was a part where it crimped... Well, almost like that 22, short, only a lot bigger. It was about like this length, maybe more stubby.

""J.R. Well I'll get a .45 a little later and we can bring it up and let you observe it.
""B.H. ""Let's take the suspect. His hands... I don't remember if they had gloves on or not. I can't remember now. I keep thinking that he had gloves on. I can't figure how he tied us... Let's ask Celia, she probably knows about that.
""J.R. Did he swear? Did he use any profane language or obscenity?
""B.H. I don't think so. If he did it was no more than I was using at the time. I don't think he used any obscenity. He might have used a swear word or something, you know. That wasn't striking to me...
""J.R. Do you have any idea what his motive might have been? Money?
""B.H. Money. He said he was going to go to Mexico and he was flat broke.
""J.R. Did he search you after he...
""B.H. Heck no! Very unprofessional. He didn't even end up taking that loose change and didn't even take my billfold.
""J.R. Why did he stab you when you weren't fighting him off or anything?
""B.H. I couldn't. Even if I'd have wanted to. I was laying on my stomach...
""J.R. So what would have been the purpose of him to stab you, do you think?
""B.H. Well I (unintelligible)...but I think he got rattled... (unintelligible)... very, very nervous. His hands were shaking... (unintelligible)... Are you nervous?
""J.R. I'm just curious. If you could write me that symbol you were telling me about. Do you think you could draw me a picture of that even without your glasses?
""B.H. Um hum (affirmative). (Draws)... kind of like that. I can't see very well...

Text: We're holding your daughter Patricia Hearst and we're never going to give her back to you unless you pigs let Remiro and Little out of prison. We already fucked your little Patricia and we're going to keep on doing it unless you let Russle and little out. We're giving you ten days and when those 10 days are up and don't hear from Russle and Little we're going to kill her the same way we killed those 4 persons. My friend killed those 3 people in that funeral home and we'er going to keep on killing if you don't let them out free.
I want you to put this in the news and in your paper an if you don't you might be our next victim. I'm writing this letter from San Jose but I live here in SF. I put this letter from San Jose - so the pigs can't trace it. I want you to put those word from where the arrows point. I want you people to know we like trouble and if you don't believe me try me. Sorry for writing crummy that's not the best I do?! I want you to show this letter to the cops and public, so they know we mean trouble. XXXXXXXXX never going to rest in peace again until you catch us??!!

recazLmDUksf84HgI,Charlie Chan at Treasure Island released,1939-08-31,,recO5mW1mFKtK0hCE,"Via Wikipedia:

Charlie and Jimmy Chan are traveling by plane to San Francisco. Jimmy befriends insurance executive Thomas Gregory. Charlie's friend, novelist Paul Essex, dies aboard the aircraft after receiving a radiogram warning him not to ignore ""Zodiac"". His briefcase mysteriously disappears. Charlie meets with Deputy Police Chief J.J. Kilvaine, and runs into reporter and old friend Peter Lewis. Charlie also meets noted local magician Fred Rhadini, and discusses Essex's death with the three men. Rhadini tells Charlie about Dr. Zodiac, a psychic preying on the rich in San Francisco. Charlie, Rhadini, and Lewis go to Dr. Zodiac's home, where Dr. Zodiac conducts an eerie séance. Lewis' fiancée, Eve Cairo, has been meeting with Dr. Zodiac, angering Lewis. Later, Kilvaine reveals that Essex was poisoned, but can't rule out suicide. Jimmy spends the afternoon following Thomas Gregory, whom he believes stole Essex's briefcase when leaving the plane. He discovers Essex's manuscript in Gregory's hotel room.

That night, Charlie attends Rhadini's magic show at the Golden Gate International Exposition on Treasure Island. Rhadini's clumsy, comic acquaintance, Elmer Kelner, is helping to serve food and drink at the club. Charlie meets Eve Cairo and socialite Bessie Sibley, as well as Rhadini's jealous wife, Myra. During her telepathy act with Fred Rhadini, Eve comes into contact with someone thinking about murder and Charlie is almost killed when a knife is thrown at him.

After the show, Charlie, followed by Rhadini and Lewis, break into Dr. Zodiac's home. They find Jimmy already there. Charlie discovers evidence that Zodiac is a fraud. When Zodiac's Turkish houseman, Abdul, arrives, Charlie searches him and finds the holster that fits the knife. Abdul escapes, and the burglars discover Zodiac's vast files which he uses to frighten and blackmail others. Charlie realizes Bessie Sibley is providing information on others to protect herself, and that Zodiac was blackmailing Essex. Charlie burns Zodiac's office to protect the innocent.

Essex's manuscript is a fictional account of Dr. Zodiac's blackmail scheme, and the next morning Charlie finds that the last page revealing who the murder was committed is missing. Charlie meets with Gregory, who says he is an insurance company detective investigating mysterious suicides. Charlie believes Gregory's claim is false, and Gregory fails to steal the manuscript back. Charlie believes Dr. Zodiac suffers from pseudologia fantastica, and Rhadini challenges Dr. Zodiac to a public test of psychic skills. Dr. Zodiac accepts the claim by leaving a note on the front door of the Temple of Magic where Rhadini performs. It's written on the back side of the missing manuscript page. The manuscript mentions a pygmy arrow; a similar arrow from a display in the foyer of the Temple of Magic is missing.

That night, Charlie, Jimmy, Bessie Sibley, Myra Rhadini, and Peter Lewis attend Rhadini's magic show, where he is assisted by Eve Cairo and Elmer Kelner. Dr. Zodiac appears during the show, and is invited on stage. As Rhadini performs a levitation trick, Zodiac is killed with the pygmy arrow. Dr. Zodiac is revealed to be Abdul. Although a bow is found, it is too brittle to have fired the arrow. Zodiac must have been stabbed with the arrow. Gregory gives Rhadini an alibi after discovering Rhadini's wand in the aisle by his seat. Kilvaine reveals that Gregory is Stewart Salsbury, and that he really is an insurance company executive.

At Kilvaine's suggestion, the murder is re-enacted with Lewis standing in for Zodiac. The secret of Rhadini's levitation trick is revealed, and Rhadini is stabbed in the aisle during the act. Myra uses the ""sphinx""—an upright metal pseudo-Egyptian coffin with a hidden elevator in its floor—to go from the stage to the below-stage area, where her husband's dressing room is located. Charlie encourages Eve to try to tap into the mind of the killer. Eve reads Charlie's thoughts, which describe the motivations of Stella Essex, Bessie Sibley, Thomas Gregory, Peter Lewis, Fred Rhadini, and Myra Rhadinia (although without mentioning their names). The mind of Dr. Zodiac interferes with Eve's mind. Eve reads Zodiac's mind, and discovers that the real Dr. Zodiac killed Abdul because only Abdul knew Dr. Zodiac's real identity.

The killer attempts to shoot Eve while she is on stage, but Jimmy spots the pistol and pushes the gun away just in time. Dr. Zodiac is revealed to be Fred Rhadini. While all eyes were on Eve, he sneaked into the wings, ran below the stage, and used the elevator in the sphinx to re-emerge on stage and attempt to kill Eve. Charlie reveals that Rhadini used a wand with a spring trigger to fire the arrow that killed Abdul. He then stabbed himself to divert attention from himself as a suspect.

Without additional concrete information, this entry should be considered a contextual snapshot of the cultural landscape during the Zodiac Killer's period of activity, rather than a significant event in the Zodiac case itself.\n\nResearchers interested in potential connections should note the geographical proximity to other Zodiac-related locations, but should not draw speculative conclusions without direct evidence.""}","{""isStale"": true, ""state"": ""empty"", ""value"": null}","{""errorType"": ""emptyDependency"", ""isStale"": false, ""state"": ""error"", ""value"": null}",2026-02-16T21:16:41.000Z,true,China Camp (Renaissance Pleasure Faire Site),2nd-annual-renaissance-pleasure-faire,151,rec790ij9Opms13lQ,69938938fa8120332de59e09,,

KRON-TV news footage from September 4th 1969 with reporter Dick Dote featuring a visit to Northern California's 3rd annual Renaissance Pleasure Faire at China Camp in San Rafael. Includes scenes of fair-goers dressed in period costume, dancing and playing music. Also includes an interview with Phyllis Patterson (1932-2014), co-creator of the Renaissance Faire concept in America with Ron Patterson, who explains that in addition to this annual event: ""What we would like to do is to have a Renaissance Center, where there can be craftesmen working all year round. Where there can be an old English inn with serving maids, where people can come and spend a while out of the hustle and bustle of the Twentieth Century."" It should be noted that the Northern California Renaissance Faire is still held annually and in 2018 will open on September 15th and 16th near Hollister, CA. It was purchased by a Colorado operator in 1994, who subsequently let it go and is now the only employee owned Renaissance Faire in the USA. Opening graphic designed by Carrie Hawks.

00:01:49.680 - 00:02:06.040
Bay Area. Created and produced by Rod and Phyllis Paterson, the fair is designed to recall the old English heritage that accented the fun filled aspects of life. Phyllis, tell me what you hope to do here. Well, what we hope to dio on the Morrow, sire, is


00:02:06.050 - 00:02:20.600
to have a renaissance pleasure faire and Tiffany market, which is a combination of the pleasure fair where people just have a good time in the old English way and also have come to buy, wears their needs for the winter. Maybe filled. You're talking about a year

00:02:32.340 - 00:02:45.400
what we would like to dio is to have a renaissance center where there can be craftsman working all year round, where there could be an old English in with serving maids where people can come and spend a while out of the hustle and bustle of the

Description
KPIX-TV news footage from September 28th 1969 featuring a report by Evan White on the traffic congestion caused by motorists trying to visit the Northern California Renaissance Pleasure Faire, at China Camp, in San Rafael. Includes brief views of the faire, shots of a very long line of cars snaking towards the camp grounds and an interview with a spokesperson who explains that with upwards of 10,000 people trying to visit each day along a 2-lane highway, they might need to find another site which can provide better access. It should be noted that the faire eventually relocated from it's China Camp site to Novato's Blackpoint Forest in 1971. As White puts it: ""Perhaps there's some special significance that so many people would endure such heat and such a mammoth traffic jam for the simple purpose of trying to escape. And it seems a pity that such simple attempts at escape into the Sixteenth Century can't be accommodated by the Twentieth Century."" Opening graphic designed by Carrie Hawks.

00:00:09.340 - 00:00:23.280
This is a slice of the pleasure, fair and Khalfani market. This Renaissance faires started three years ago in San Francisco, and it's grown such proportions that no longer can handle the huge crowds that one in 10,000 people a day are allowed in. That number is usually


00:00:23.280 - 00:00:37.310
reached in the first two or three hours of its opening. By two o'clock in the afternoon, the people are turned away by the hundreds. The result. A new home may have to be found for this 16th century event next year. Well, first of all, because the


00:00:37.310 - 00:00:52.160
access to this area here as beautiful as it is and we truly love this site as beautiful it is, though we are have the access Excuse me of a two lane highway, and with the crowds to come here to the fair upwards of 10,000 people, we


00:00:52.160 - 00:01:04.430
have to have a close highway to a fair site where we can handle all the cars and get at the same time. It's got to be far enough away from civilization where people can truly step back into the 16th century and not be hassled, shall we


00:01:04.430 - 00:01:17.960
say, by 20th century necessity in other words, they can get the whole feeling of the fair and move back into the 16th century. And yet we still have to find an area where the cars can move in. And we can get people in and out without


00:01:17.960 - 00:01:28.450
the Highway Patrol having too much of a problem without us having too much of a problem. And so people can move easily in and out of the fairgrounds. And this is why we think we're gonna have to move from this site here as beautiful as you


00:01:28.450 - 00:02:00.110
can see it. ISS Perhaps there's some special significance that so many people would endure such heat in such a mammoth traffic jam for the simple purpose of trying to escape. And it seems a pity that such simple attempts at


00:02:00.110 - 00:02:07.660
escape into the 16th century can't be accommodated by the 20th century. This is Evan White, reporting for eyewitness news from the woods in Marin

Text: WHATEVER HAPPENED TO ZODIAC?
This is the official police drawing of the man who calls himself Zodiac. But the killer wrote a letter making jest of the sketch, insisting that it does not resemble him.
Cab driver Paul Stine was the victim of a senseless Zodiac slaying. 
This young couple was slashed to ribbons by the sadistic monster who later boasted of the deed in letters to newspaper editors. 

A detective checks a blood-soaked patch of cloth, sent through the mail by Zodiac, with the shirt of the madman's latest victim. They matched.
The Zodiac became angry at stories written by Paul Avery. So he sent this card, threatening to kill the reporter.

""WHEREVER HE IS—HE WILL KILL AGAIN!""
After writing the bloodiest chapter in modern criminality the most feared killer of the 20th century has disappeared. Could he be in your city? 

When the final book on satanic brutality is written, such names as Bluebeard, the Cleveland Butcher, England's John Christy and Jack the Ripper will receive prominent mention. But none will receive more prominent display than the name ""Zodiac"". 
The man who calls himself ""Zodiac"" has a snakepit for a mind, brimstone for a heart and the nerve of a programmed robot. The police know he has committed five merciless murders. By the ""Zodiac's"" own boast, he has killed thirteen. His calling card is a strip of bloody clothing torn from the body of a victim. He is a cunning madman who writes riddles in a strange code that baffles even the most expert military cryptographers. He is the single-most baffling crime phenomenon of our generation. 
For almost two years, the ""Zodiac"" held the San Francisco Bay Area in the palm of his hand—pricking it ever now and then just to watch it jump. Then, he disappeared. It has been almost two years since his last, evil message was received. Some say he is either dead, in prison or in a mental institution. But most lawmen still working on the case believe he is lying low after almost being caught on one occasion. Some think he has moved out of the Bay area and taken up residence in another city. And those who know him best do not even speculate on if he will kill again. They only try to guess when it will happen and where. 

by CARMENA FREEMAN 

The Christmas greeting was one that had been belched up from the caverns of Hell. It had taken nine days to travel from San Francisco, California to Munich, Germany, during which time it had passed through extensive police laboratory examination before being dispatched to the rightful recipient, Attorney Melvin Belli, then on business in the German city. The message bore no relation to the Peace on Earth tidings that temporarily link men and nations in brotherhood over the holidays. The greeting was a plea, a threat, and a reminder that some place on California's West Coast lurked a killer of extraordinary dimension; a man who was known to have taken five lives and who had boasted of taking many more. It was a message from a man who once threatened to bomb a school bus full of children, a man who used for his calling card scraps from the bloodied shirt of his last known victim. 
That Christmas card, received on December 29, 1969, halfway across the world from where it was posted, did not take its place on the mantle piece along with other reminders of the season. It served, instead, as a fresh prod to Attorney Belli to try to break through the killer's impregnable mask; it served to swell the staggering file of material gathered for over a year in the police departments of San Francisco's Bay Area—a file labeled simply ""Zodiac."" 
The letter to Belli read: ""Dear Melvin, This is the Zodiac speaking. I wish you a happy Christmas. The one thing I ask of you is this, please help me, I cannot reach out for help because of this thing in me won't let me. I am finding it extremely difficult to hold it in check I am afraid I will lose control again and take my ninethe and possibly tenth victim. Please help me, I am drowning. 
""But if I hold back too long from No. nine I will lose all control of my self... Please help me. I cannot remain in control much longer."" 

The maniacal ravings of an unhitched mind? Perhaps. But Attorney Belli, internationally recognized legal expert and highly successful defender in numerous courtroom battles, did not dismiss it as such. Two months earlier, on October 22, 1969, Belli had appeared on a popular San Francisco TV program at Zodiac's request and had held up his end of one of the most bizarre telephone conversations ever recorded. 



The events leading to Belli's appearance that October morning were typical of Zodiac's unique and stunning pattern of behavior. He had phoned Jim Dunbar, host on KGO's early morning TV talk show and specified that he wanted Belli to appear on the program that day at which time he (Zodiac) would call in and reveal himself. 


What unmitigated gall, you say. What would lead a wanted killer to think the nation's TV channels were open to his personal whim, or that the services of one of the country's leading attorneys were available? But ah, you have not reckoned with Zodiac. Whatever finis is written to his history, that history will nudge Bluebeard and Jack the Ripper aside for space in the biographies of the world's most cunning slayers. 


The killer had not labeled himself Zodiac until August, 1969, but his fiendish hand had been at work as far back as December of 1968, and as the exhaustive research into his past continued, there came startling evidence that he had introduced his specific brand of horror as early as 1966. 

Zodiac's brazen disregard for convention had first manifested itself on August 1, 1969, in three separate letters, one to each of the managing editors of the 
San Francisco Chronicle, the Examiner, and the Vallejo Times-Herald. 

The letter to the 
Times-Herald started: ""Dear Editor, I am the killer of the 2 teenagers last Christmas at Lake Herman and the girl last 4th of July. To prove this I shall state some facts which only I & the police know. 

""The facts: Christmas
1. Brand name of ammo Super-X
2. 10 shots fired
3. Boy was on back feet to car
4. Girl was lyeing on right side feet to west 4th of July
5. Girl was wearing patterned pants
6. Boy was also shot in knee
7. Brand name of ammo was Western"" 
8. 
Attached to the letter was a neatly printed code with the explanation: ""Here is a cipher or that is part of one. In it is revealed my true identity. The other two parts have been mailed to the S. F. 
Examiner & the S. F. Chronicle. 

""I want you to print the cipher on your front page by Fry afternoon Aug. 1, 1969. If you do not do this I will go on a kill rampage Fry night that will last the whole week end. I will cruse around and pick off all stray people or couples that are alone, then move on to kill some more untill I have killed over a dozen people."" 

The signature was a cross inside a circle, simulating the cross hairs in a telescopic rifle sight. 

The editor knew to which murders the letter referred. The first had taken place close to midnight on December 20, 1968, on the Lake Herman road several miles outside of Vallejo. The bodies of two young people were discovered sprawled beside a station wagon by a ranch wife on her way into Benecia to pick up her children from a movie. Town officers were dispatched immediately to find 16-year-old Bettylou Jensen, dead of five bullet wounds in her back, and 17-year-old David Faraday near death from a single bullet hole in his skull. Both youngsters were students in the Vallejo schools, well liked, bright, and handsome. The area where their bodies were found was one popular to young lovers and police directed their early efforts toward pinning down a jealousy motive or locating a disgruntled suitor of the girl. 

The initial theory that the seeds of the tragedy had been sown within the confines of the city of Vallejo and its immediate surroundings and that continued questioning, prodding, and the follow-up of meager clues would lead to the killer vanished with explosive force when Sergeant Lundblad received a telephone call from a local youth. The boy was reporting a weird experience he had had at the scene of the murders just shortly before they occurred. He and a girl were parked in the same area at 9:30 that Friday night. ""I thought no one else was around,"" he said. ""Then I saw these backlights come on. I gunned our car out of there and the other driver followed me. I'm not sure he was actually chasing us because he never gained. I turned off toward Benecia and he went in the oppostie direction. That was the end of it until I read what happened in that same place an hour and a half later."" 
The boy's story lent a disconcerting blow to previous speculation and opened up a far more disturbing possibility. Bettylou and David apparently were random victims of a roving nut who haunted lovers' lanes and picked off his targets at will. 
The second shooting occured sometime after midnight on July 4th, while fireworks were still brightening the skies over the Bay waters. The attack took the life of a 22-year-old Vallejo waitress, Darlene Ferrin, and came within a hair's breadth of killing her escort. Three youths came upon the victims stretched beside their car not far from the municipal golf course in Blue Rock Springs Park, on Vallejo's outskirts. 
Death claimed the young waitress before she reached the hospital, but a thin trace of life pulsed in her escort and the officers who circled the car examined the ground, gauged the murder weapon and searched for clues. The officers clung desperately to the hope that the critically injured youth would be able to supply some lead to his assailant. 
The investigation was only minutes old when a freak note was injected in the form of a phone call to the woman clerk in Vallejo's police headquarters. ""I want to report a double murder,"" a male voice said. ""If you will go one mile east on Columbus Parkway to a public park you will find the kids in a brown car. They were shot with a 9 millimeter Luger. I also killed those kids last year. Goodbye."" 
The Ferrin car was brown. Nine millimeter shells were found at the scene. There had not been time to publicize these findings. The caller had to be taken seriously. And what of his sinister end note, ""those kids last year""? Was he also the Faraday-Jensen killer? 
The young man said that he and the girl had just pulled off the road when their car door was jerked open and the gunman let loose a fusillade of shots. The girl fatally wounded fell back behind the wheel, but the youth managed to tumble out of the door and to fake death until the gunman drove off. 


""His car? You saw it?"" 

""Yes. It was remarkably like Darlene's. Same color, brown, and the same model. Carried California license plates."" 

Investigators chased down tips, followed up leads, correlated procedures on the Lake Herman and Columbus Parkway shootings, but by the beginning of the next month, when the bewildering message in code arrived, neither case was near a solution. 

Three days after the first letters were received, a second message came to the 
San Francisco Examiner. It opened with the ominous greeting, ""This is the Zodiac speaking."" Contained in this communication were references to the two Vallejo shootings that proved to the satisfaction of Deputy Lundblad and Police Chief Jack Stiltz that they were, without question, dealing with the three-time killer. It was this letter, irrefutably authored by the slayer, that provided the popular name by which he was to be called during the course of his criminal life—""Zodiac"". 
It was a high school teacher and his wife from North Salinas, California, who, by combining training, skill and remarkable tenacity, succeeded in unscrambling the code, thereby giving to its author a cloak of such fearsome pattern as to panic the sturdiest of men. 
Deciphered, the message, with all of its misspellings, read: ""I LIKE KILLING PEOPLE BECAUSE IT IS MORE FUN THAN KILLING WILD GAME IN THE FORREST BECAUSE MAN IS THE MOAT DANGERUES ANIMAL OF ALL TO KILL SOMETHING GIVES ME THE MOST THRILLING EXPERIENCE.. THE BEST PART OF IT IS THAE WHEN I DIE I WILL BE REBORN IN PARADICE AND ALL THE I HAVE KILLED WILL BECOME MY SLAVES I WILL NOT GIVE YOU MY NAME BECAUSE YOU WILL TRS TO SLOI DOWN OR STOP MY COLLECTING OF SLAVES FOR MY AFTERLIFE."" 
That Zodiac was mindful of this lapse in caution became apparent to a stunned county on September 27, 1969, in one of the most awesome displays of savagery ever perpetrated. 
His diabolical signature was first evidenced on that Saturday afternoon when a fisherman, working the waters of Lake Berryessa... heard the weak but urgent cries for help from what appeared to be two figures on the shore some 20 yards away. Reluctant to investigate on his own, the fisherman gave throttle to his boat and soon returned with Berryessa Park Rangers Sergeant William White and Dennis Land from the nearby ranger station. What they found Ranger White later described as the worst thing he'd ever seen, ""two nice kids cut to pieces."" 
The ""two nice kids"" were Cecilia Shepard, a 21-year-old coed from the University of California in Riverside... and 20-year-old Bryan Hartnell, a junior in the college. Those two students, their splendid young bodies ribboned by knife slashes, lay on the lakeshore on a carpet of sand reddened by their blood. Their wrists and ankles held the gnawed ends of rope that had lashed them in bondage. 
They had driven up to the lake for a picnic, parking Hartnell's car on a knoll above the shore. They thought themselves to be alone, but at roughly 4 p.m., an apparition slid out from behind a tree and approached them, a stocky man in baggy black pants, his face covered by a shoulder-length hood, his hand waving an automatic pistol. 
""I'm a fugitive,"" he announced, ""I killed a guard in escaping from Deer Lodge Prison in Montana. I need money and a car."" 
The youth offered him all he had, 75 cents, and handed him the keys to his car. But the gunman had changed his mind. ""I'm going to have to tie you up,"" he said, pulling a length of cord from his pocket. He ordered Miss Shepard to tie up Hartnell, then he bound the girl, hands and ankles. The gun had been replaced by a knife and when both victims were securely trussed, the hooded monster began plunging the weapon repeatedly into first the man, then the girl, accompanying each thrust with a maniacal laugh. For what seemed an eternity to the horrified, screaming, helpless victims, the merciless butcher continued. Their tormentor first slashed, then stabbed as his hideous laughter echoed along the banks of the lake. 
With the arrival of the ambulance, the victims were rushed to the Queen of the Valley Hospital in Napa while investigators began the loathsome task of gathering up mementos of the assault.  Chief among these was the car door from Hartnell's Karman-Ghia on which the hooded assailant had scrawled three dates: December 20, 1968; July 4th and September 27, with the hour, 6:30. The signature brought chill of recognition to the examining officers: a circle within which were the cross hairs simulating a telescopic gunsight. 
If there was any question in the minds of the investigators that the Lake Berryessa atrocity was the work of the same man who murdered young Faraday, Miss Jensen and Miss Ferrin, that doubt was dispelled within minutes with the receipt of a phone call at 7:30 that evening in the Napa County Sheriff's office. Deputy David Straight answered the ring. ""I want to report a murder,"" a man's voice said. ""No, a double murder. I just killed two kids. They are two miles north of park headquarters. They were in a white Volkswagon Karman-Ghia. I'm the one who did it."" 
The call was ended abruptly, but there was no sound of the receiver being replaced. Police swarmed over public phone booths and in a neighboring car wash found the receiver dangling from its wire. 
A day later, Miss Shepard was dead, but the information she had supplied, along with that provided by Hartnell, gave the officials the first physical data available on the four-time killer. He was not, investigators proved, an escapee from the Deer Lodge Prison in Montana. He was, according to the patchy descriptions obtained from the two students, probably in his 30s, somewhere between 5 feet 9 inches and 6 feet tall, weighing in the neighborhood of 200 pounds. Through the overlarge eye holes cut in the hood, Hartnell was able to get a glimpse of brown hair and of spectacles covered with sunshades. The killer was husky of voice and had been armed with a pistol, not a Luger, and a butcher knife some 10 to 12 inches long. 
The kinship took on straight blood lines the morning of October 13, 1969, when the editor of the Chronicle slit open a letter addressed to him and stared down at a swatch of blood-stained shirt that fell from the envelope. The Chronicle had received its invitation to become the killer's pen pal. 
""This is the Zodiac speaking"" the accompanying letter began. ""I am the murderer of the taxi driver over by Washington St. and Maple St. last night. To prove this here is a blood stained piece of his shirt. I am the man who did in the people in the north bay area. 
""The S. F. police could have caught me last night if they had searched the park properly instead of holding road races with their motorcycles seeing who could make the most noise. The car drivers should have just parked their cars & sat their quietly waiting for me to come out of cover."" 
The cabbie to whom Zodiac referred was Paul Stine, a night driver for Yellow Cab, who had picked up a fare in front of San Francisco's Fairmont Hotel Sunday evening and followed instructions to take him to Washington and Maple Streets. A few blocks short of the destination, the passenger, riding in the front seat, pulled a 9mm automatic from his coat, drilled Stine once and fatally through the cheek, took his wallet, ripped a strip from the cabbie's shirt and calmly stepped from the death car. He wiped the door clean and strode off into the protection of the Presidio's woods. 
Three youngsters witnessed this much of the drama and passed it on in breathless relay to investigators, adding the information that the killer was white, 25 to 30 years old, roughly 5 feet 9 inches tall. His reddish brown hair was close cut and he wore heavy-rimmed glasses. 
A partial estimate of that depth was revealed three days later when police released the complete text of the letter the 
Chronicle had received that Monday morning. ""School children are nice targets,"" he had written. ""I think I shall wipe out a school bus some morning. Just shoot out the front tires and then pick off the kiddies as they come bouncing out."" 
At 7:14 the studio phone rang. Belli took the call. A soft, boyish voice was transmitted into the homes of thousands of hypnotized listeners. Then the caller hung up. Minutes later, he called again. ""Meet me on the roof of the Fairmont Hotel,"" he instructed Belli. ""Come alone or I'll jump."" 
For three hours, the brief but regular phone calls came. The caller was asked to abandon the ominous name of Zodiac and agreed to be called Sam. He expressed curiosity about what would happen to him if he surrendered. Belli assured him of a fair trial and offered to see that he got medical treatment. 
The phone call to Oakland, they believed, was made by Zodiac. The calls that came through to the TV station were the antics of a fake. Sam was sick. Sam was in need of treatment. But Sam was not Zodiac. 
These suspicions were buttressed by the conclusions of those who had previously heard Zodiac's voice.  All of them, the woman clerk from the Vallejo Police Department; Deputy Straight from Napa; Bryan Hartnell who survived the vicious Lake Berryessa knifing and Miss Ferrin's escort who recovered from the bullet wounds received on July 4th, listened to playbacks of the taped TV conversations. ""Not the Zodiac,"" was the verdict. 
In the second part of the letter, one of the longest the Zodiac had submitted, he claimed seven instead of five victims, expressed anger at the lies the police were telling about him, and announced that henceforth he would not admit to murders he committed. ""They shall look like routine robberies, killings of anger, & a few fake accidents. 
""The police shall never catch me because I have been too clever for them."" 
He then listed all of the ways in which he had been ""too clever."" 

1. I look like the description passed out only when I do my thing, the rest of the time I look entirely different. I shall not tell you what my descise (disguise) consists of when I kill. 
2. As of Yet I have left no fingerprints behind me contrary to what the police say in my killings I wear transparent fingertip guards. All it is is 2 coats of airplane cement coated over my finger tips. quite unnoticible and very efective. 
3. My killer tools have been boughten through the mail order outfits before the ban went into efect except one & it was bought out of the state. 
""I was walking down the hill to the park when this cop car pulled up & one of them called me over & asked if I saw anyone acting suspicious or strange in the last 5 to 10 min & I said yes there was this man who was running by waving a gun & and cops peeled rubber & went around the corner I directed. I disappeared into the park a block & a half away never to be seen again. 
Although it was not disclosed at the time, it was later reported that San Francisco police had questioned one man in the Presidio woods the night of the Stine murder. Through an unexplained error in the transmitted radio instructions, police had been told the wanted killer was black. For this reason, no specific attention was given to the man to whom they spoke. 
As she neared the town of Patterson, she was flagged down by a motorist who advised her that her left rear wheel was loose. He volunteered to fix it. His offer was accepted, but when the woman set off again, the wheel fell to the ground, and the man suggested that he drive her to a garage. He pocketed the keys to her car and started down the highway with the woman and her daughter. They had gone only a few miles when the woman realized that he had no intention of finding a garage. He drove her along deserted rural roads for more than two hours, making no overt advances, but threatening her with death in the soft, calm voice of a maniac who meant it. Through sheer luck, the woman finally was able to fling herself and child from the car and to hide in a culvert until he tired of hunting for her and drove away. She managed to reach Patterson where she blurted out her story to the local police. In the course of describing her tormentor, she glanced up at the official bulletin board where a wanted Zodiac poster was tacked. ""That's the man,"" she screamed. ""My God, that's the man who picked me up."" 
The Vallejo Times-Herald now put it in print:""...so I now have a little list starting with the woman & her baby that I gave a rather interesting ride for a couple of hours one evening a few months back that ended in my burning her car where I found them."" 
By October, Zodiac was claiming 13 victims. ""Some of them fought. It was horrible."" 
It was during this same month, on the eve of Halloween, that Zodiac, for the first time, swung away from a nameless list of potential victims and singled out one person on whom to vent his spleen. That person was Paul Avery, the 
Chronicle's astute crime reporter who had penned the major share of the Zodiac stories that appeared in that San Francisco journal. ""You are doomed,"" Zodiac informed Avery through his favorite device, a greeting card. 
Avery's block-buster had been distilled from a long forgotten murder file in Riverside, California. A file numbered 352-481, which contained all the evidence attached to the slaying of Cheri Jo Bates, who, in 1966, the year of her death, was an honor student in Riverside City College. 
On the morning of October 31 of that year, a groundskeeper came upon the body of Cheri Jo, pierced with knife wounds and nearly decapitated from a slash across the throat. Investigators back-pedalled through the evening hours of Sunday, October 30, and learned that Cheri Jo had driven her Volkswagen into the parking lot of the school library at 6:10 p.m., spent 20 minutes in the library, and returned to her car at 6:30. An examination of the machine revealed that in her absence someone had tampered with the motor, jerking the middle wire loose from the distributor. There was evidence that the vandal then waited for the girl and lured her to her death with an offer to drive her to a garage. 
A month later when two letters, identical in their wording, were delivered to the 
Press-Enterprise in Riverside and the Homicide Detail of the local police department. ""She was young and beautiful,"" the letters started. ""But now she is battered and dead. She is not the first and she will not be the last. Miss Bates was stupid. She went to the slaughter like a lamb. She did not put up a struggle. But I did. It was a ball. I said it was about time. She asked me 'about time for what?' I said it was about time for her to die. I am not sick. I am insane. But that will not stop the game."" 
Exactly five months later to the day, the mails disgorged a fresh flood of ""Cheri Jo"" letters; one to the 
Press-Enterprise; one to the police department, and, cruelly, one to the dead girl's father. The message in triplicate: ""BATES HAD TO DIE THERE WILL BE MORE."" Two of the notes carried an abbreviated signature a printed Z. 
His verdict: ""The hand-printing scratched on the desk is the same as on the three letters, particularly like that on the envelopes, and this hand-printing is by the same person who has been preparing the Zodiac letters that have been received by the Chronicle."" 
That confidence was severely shaken on April 7, 1972. On that day, a 33-year-old legal secretary from Marin County was walking near her home when she was knocked to the ground by a car. The driver went to her assistance and offered to drive her home. When she refused, he flew into a frenzy, stabbed her, and fled. The woman was treated at Marin General Hospital where she provided a description of her assailant: in his early 40s, stocky, and wearing dark, horn-rimmed glasses. 
""It's a good chance he's the Zodiac,"" Captain Ken Narlow of the Napa County sheriff's office remarked. ""I've been chasing that S. O. B. for two and a half years and this description fits him to a T."" 
One of his last letters may provide a clue to what has happened to the Zodiac. In it, he said he would no longer reveal those murders he would commit. ""They shall look like routine robberies, killings of anger & a few fake accidents.""

SUSPECT: ALLEN, ARTHUR LEIGH
WMA DOB: 12/18/33 Address: Sunset Trailer Park, Space A7, Santa Rosa
On 9/26/74 R/O contacted Deputy District Attorney Steve [REDACTED] in regards to a possible criminal complaint against suspect Arthur Leigh Allen. After reading the report, Mr. [REDACTED] issued a 288 PC complaint on the suspect as well as a search warrant for his residence being a trailer at Sunset Trailer Park, Space A7. A warrant was also issued on the suspect and bail was set at $5000.00 by Judge James [REDACTED]. The search warrant was also issued for the following personal property to wit: 1) one jar of cold cream or white lubricant 2) hand or bath towels with cold cream or lubricant thereon 3) such other and further physical evidence tending to show that the offense of 288 PC has occurred including, but not limited to photographs, letters, diaries, memos, notes, books or magazines.
At approximately 8:50 a.m. on 9/27/74 R/O responded to the suspect's residence along with Det. Sgt. Walker, Det. Sgt. Carlstedt and Deputy Biehler. The suspect was not at home. R/O then proceeded to serve the search warrant. We found that the door to the residence was locked, but gained entry with the assistance of a lock pick. We searched the entire residence and found the following: one 16 oz. jar of vaseline approximately one quarter full on a shelf on the inside of the bedroom; one jar of cold cream also on this same shelf; we also found a piece of wood approximately 8-10"" in length which resembled that of a dildoe; also found on the bed was a a large bath towels multicolored stripes; also hanging from a small cupboard at the end of the bed was another large bath towel, multicolored stripes. These two towels as well as the vaseline, coldcream and the piece of wood were photographed and taken into evidence by I.D. Technician Nick Flint. Before departure, a copy of this search warrant was left inside the residence with a list of the property that had been removed. A short time later the issued warrant was sighted at Stopper and Kirk Lumber Company which is approximately one block from Sunset Trailer Park. At this time he was advised of the outstanding warrant against him and taken into custody. R/O and Deputy Biehler then transported him to the Sheriff's Office.
R/O and Deputy Biehler then proceeded to interview the suspect. The time that the interview started was approximately 9:50 a.m. Suspect was advised of the allegations as well as the penal code section that he is being charged with. He was also shown the warrant. R/O then advised him of his rights per Miranda. Suspect said he understood these rights and would waive them and talk to me.

without the presence of an attorney. He was also given a rights waiver form which he read and signed. See attached. This rights waiver form was witnessed by Deputy Biehler. The form was signed at 9:58 a.m. At approximately 9:59 a.m. R/O proceeded to tape the interview.
Once the tape was started I again asked the suspect if he understood and would waive his rights and again he indicated that he did understand his rights and would waive them. I again informed him of the charge against him and he almost immediately started asking questions about a disposition of the case. He wanted to know what would happen if ""supposing"" he pled guilty. He asked how pleading guilty would affect the disposition. He wanted to know if the judge would be more lenient with him if he did plead guilty. The suspect was very concerned about what type of sentence he would get. He says he worked at Atascadero approximately 15 years ago and did not want to become an inmate there. The suspect even asked R/O if he could borrow a sheet of paper. This was provided to him by me. On this paper he wrote the words ""guilty"" and ""defender"" opposite each other. He then asked me what would happen if he pleaded guilty at this time. I informed him that he would be booked in the County Jail, he would have a right to two phone calls and to bail which is at $5000.00. He then asked me what would happen if he asked to see a Public Defender. I informed him that he would still be booked into the County Jail and still be allowed to phone calls and bail. See attached written pieces of paper that was taken into evidence.
Suspect was very concerned about his future. At one point he said ""I can always confess guilty, but I would like to talk to a Public Defender"". R/O contacted the Public Defender's Office by phone, but was informed that all the attorneys were in court. Investigator Dick Gore advised me he would respond to my office. A few minutes later Mr. Gore came in and advised the suspect after he was informed of his rights that he should keep silent other than advising me of his name and address. The suspect then requested to speak to R/O again. Mr. Gore then left.
There was more talk about disposition of the case and R/O could only tell him as to past experience in regards to sentencing. After approximately 45 minutes the suspect again indicated he wanted to speak to a Public Defender. The interview was then terminated. The suspect was then booked into the County Jail.
Investigation to continue in regards to another possible victim. This possible victim is a 14 year old male, last name of [REDACTED].

doing much work around the trailer, go fishing, play games, etc. I asked David if Leigh had ever shown him dirty pictures or magazines. David said that he had not. R/O also asked him about any 288a type situations that may occur. David says that on numerous occasions Leigh would place his mouth upon David's penis and suck. He said he would have his mouth down there about one minute. David further advises that afterwards he would ""force"" David to place his mouth on Leigh's penis also for approximately one minute. He said Leigh would have him move his head in an up and down fashion. David does not know if anything like an ejaculation occurred with Leigh. He also doesn't know if Leigh's penis was hard or soft. He says it was kind of inbetween hard and soft. He also says he has not observed Leigh touching himself in any way.
David says he knows the difference between telling a truth and telling a lie and he would get into trouble if he told a lie. He says he is telling R/O the truth today and knows he would be in serious trouble if he did not tell the truth. In R/O's opinion David is telling the truth and will make a very good witness in court. It is also R/O's opinion that the suspect bought David's cooperation and silence by giving him money after each and every occurrence.
With the assistance of David's mother, Beverly [REDACTED], it was determined that at least one act occurred sometime between July 11 and July 25 of this year. She says she remembers that Leigh Allen visited her home around 5 to 6 p.m. on a Thursday. She advises the Thursday would be after July 4 but before August 1. This would leave July 11, 18 and 25. She advises that at this time David indicated he wanted to go fishing. Leigh then suggested they go fishing right then. With Beverly [REDACTED] consent, they both left the residence. Apparently they did not return until 10 or 11 p.m. When later asked about this David said they went fishing at Spring Lake, but first stopped off at Leigh's trailer where a sexual offense was committed.
R/O then talked to Jaime David Hamilton [REDACTED], 9 years of age. He confirms David's report of being told by David that ""Leigh forced me to screw him"". Jaime says that David told him more than one time what had happened. David says that he was forced by Leigh into this act. I asked Jaime what he meant by ""screw"" and he indicated it had nothing to do with Leigh's penis. Jaime does not remember when David told him, but said it was probably sometime in August. Jaime said he knows Leigh but has never been alone with him. Jaime also indicated he has never been a victim of Leigh. R/O then concluded the interview with Jaime. R/O has no further information at this time.

Upon arrival at work at 8 a.m. on 9/24/74, I received a note written by Sgt. Hutmacher. The note indicated that R/O should attempt to contact a Beverly [REDACTED] in regards to her son, David, possibly being the victim of a molestation. The note further says the possible suspect is a Arthur Leigh Allen who resides in the Sunset Trailer Park on Santa Rosa Avenue.
At approximately 9 a.m. R/O made phone contact with Beverly [REDACTED]. She briefed that she believed her son had been the victim of a molest by Arthur Leigh Allen approximately a month ago. After a brief conversation, I told Mrs. [REDACTED] to bring her son into the Sheriff's Office at 3 p.m. this date for an interview. She also indicated that David's best friend, Jaime [REDACTED], also knew something about the molest. I also requested that she bring in Jaime at 3 p.m.
At approximately 3:30 p.m., 9/24/74, Beverly [REDACTED] accompanied by her son, David, and Jaime [REDACTED] contacted R/O. I then interviewed Beverly [REDACTED]. She says that Arthur Leigh Allen has been a ""friend of the family"" for approximately one year. She says that he has taken a great interest in David and he appeared to be a very nice man. She says he and David had gotten along real well. According to her, Leigh (Arthur Allen) lives alone in the Sunset Trailer Park. On numerous occasions he has visited her and David at her residence. Also on numerous occasions he has requested he be allowed to take David home with him or on fishing trips. She had not had any indication up until yesterday that there was something wrong. She further advises that at approximately 11 p.m. on 9/23/74 she talked to David, and Jaime who also resides with her talking in bed. It should be noted that Beverly [REDACTED] and a friend, Sharon [REDACTED] share the same dwelling. Sharon [REDACTED] is the mother of Jaime [REDACTED]. She goes on to say that she asked why they weren't asleep and David said he had something to tell her. She asked what it was and David told her that Leigh had forced him to do things that were bad. At this time she took him into another room and asked him what he meant by that. His reply was that when Leigh takes him home to his trailer, he makes him go into the bedroom and forces him to take off his clothes and then he also forces him to lay on the bed. David goes on to say Leigh takes his own clothing off and gets on top of him and puts his penis between his legs and ""humps me"". Beverly [REDACTED] asked David if Leigh had hurt him and David says that he had not, but it did scare him. She further asked David why he did not tell her what had happened before this. David says he meant to, but he kept forgetting. He also says that Leigh always gave him money and told him not to tell anyone about it.

R/O also says that he told his friend Jaime about it quite some time ago. She further asked David why he always wanted to go back to the trailer with Leigh. David says he likes Leigh but doesn't like the things he does to him. David also told his mother it had happened several times.
R/O then, after taking a written statement from Beverly [REDACTED], taped an interview with her son, David. The taped portion of the interview started at 4:11 p.m. and was concluded at 4:41 p.m. During the interview, David said he has known Leigh for quite sometime. He says Leigh lives in a green and white trailer in a trailer park on Santa Rosa Avenue. As far as he knows Leigh lives alone. David says he has been in Leigh's trailer ""quite a lot"". He said the last time was sometime during the past summer. David goes on to say Leigh ""forces"" him to take off his clothing and lay on the bed. He says Leigh then takes off his own clothing and gets on top of him. David says he then ""screws me"". R/O asked David what he meant by ""screw"" and he replied that Leigh puts his ""penis"" between his legs and goes up and down. R/O asked David what he meant by ""penis"" and he says that you use the penis to go to the bathroom with. David describes Leigh's penis as being ""big, long and round"". David however is not sure as to whether Leigh's penis is hard or soft. He says prior to this sexual act, Leigh put some creamy white stuff between his legs. This cream is kept in a clear white jar which is normally kept on a shelf in the bedroom. David says he (Leigh) always rubs this white cream between his legs prior to screwing him. R/O asked David how long Leigh screws him and the reply was 15 to 30 minutes. David describes Leigh's body as going up and down. R/O could not determine from asking David questions whether or not Leigh had an ejaculation. He goes on to say that after Leigh was through he would wipe the cream off with a towel. David says Leigh always gives him money afterwards. This apparently is either 25¢ or 50¢. He further states this has happened more than 12 times during the summer, but does not know exactly how many times. He says Leigh told him on several occasions not to tell anyone.
R/O asked David why he did not tell his mother and he says he meant to, but always forgot. He did say he told his friend Jaime about it and also told him to remind him to tell his mother, but still would forget to tell his mother until last evening. David indicated he did tell Leigh he didn't like what was going on and wanted it stopped. He says Leigh's reply was ""I know you don't like it but I'm just a nasty man"". David says that Leigh would molest him everytime he and David were alone. Also, that is the first thing they would do together is go to the bedroom. Afterwards, they would do whatever they were planning on.

I hope the enclosed “key” will prove to be beneficial to you in connection with the cipher letter writer. Working puzzles criptograms and word puzzles is one of my pleasures.

R.O. was contacted by a confidential informant in regard to possible new developments in the Darlene Ferrin 187 occurring 7-4-69 at the Blue Rock Springs Park, this is VPD File 243 146. Upon reviewing information submitted there seems to be sufficient cause to initiate an investigation to ascertain the validity of this information. Information consists of the following points which are only brief inquiries into the background of the alleged suspect. This information is viewed as circumstantial at best, but sufficient to require follow-up investigation.

**Point #1.** There is in existence two composites of the alleged Zodiac Killer, one from San Francisco; one from Berryessa; and a brief description from the surviving victim in the Vallejo 187. This alleged subject (suspect) tentatively matches the description given in all cases. A photograph submitted from a driver's license taken in 1969 of the suspect has a good resemblance to the composites from other jurisdictions.

**Point #2.** Research into the suspect's military background indicates that he did receive seven (7) months of training in military code work and then was an instructor in crytograph.

**Point #3.** He apparently knew the family of the victim's as a mysterious caller. Placed three separate calls within 2 hours after Darlene Ferrin's death to each of the family members. These calls were made before media announcement of the murder and made certain references indicating the caller knew Darlene.

**Point #4.** The suspect spent many hours at the restaurant where Darlene worked as a waitress. This has been verified by a [REDACTED] Officer, Officer Balding who has picked the subject's picture out of a lineup indicating he has

been seen in there conversing with the deceased.

**Point 5.** An incident had occurred in Vacaville in regard to threatening letters received and phone calls made. This suspect has been identified as an individual seen in a parked car in the area where the young woman lived. His vehicle matched exactly the description of the car seen parked in the area of this young woman's apartment in Vacaville and tentatively his photograph has been identified as the man sitting in that vehicle. In regard to the same case he was accurately described by witnesses who indicated the same young woman in the Vacaville Incident had apparently gone to a mountain area to visit a relative some 200 miles north. The suspect matched the description of the individual who followed her to that area.

**Point #6.** It appears that during most Zodiac activities the suspect was unemployed. It has been correlated that during suspect's periods of employment there were no Zodiac incidents reported. Suspect is a member of alcoholic anonymous and has had a problem with alcohol for a number of years. He's been involved with alcoholics anonymous ever since 1962. This, in turn gives him an unusual amount of freedom from his family responsibilities, especially at night.

**Point #7.** There are several clues in the letters that appear to have application to the suspect. One of which refers to a post card received by the San Francisco Chronicle on 3- of 71 indicating ""Sought victim 12, peek through the pines"". It has been established that suspect lives in a very thick group of pine trees in a remote area, and you can only see the residence by looking down or peeking through the pines down the roadway. Further, there was another remark made by the Zodiac that ""I was swamped out by rain we had awhile back."" suspect lives in

the noted time period, meaning month of the year, this area is subject to heavy flooding, and photographs have been obtained of the area in the general vicinity of subject's house while it was flooded.

**Point #8.** The suspect did, in fact, own a vehicle that approximates the suspect car on the Vallejo Homicide. That being a white 1961 Chevrolet.

**Point 9.** A young woman by the name of Karen [REDACTED] was a babysitter for the deceased Darlene Ferrin during the months of January through May of 1969. She reports an incident where an older white male matching the general physical description of the Zodiac and the alleged suspect was watching the residence of Darlene. Upon questioning Darlene in regard to this, Darlene indicated she had seen this subject do something awful and indicated it was murder. At that time she allegedly said the name.

**Point #10.** Another point seems to be involved in homosexual activities as is documented by a report of the Solano Sheriff's Office received as to suspect hanging around the rest stop area on Hunters Hill engaging in homosexual activities. He was questioned by Sergeant Lundblad in regard to these activities, and another incident was brought up on regarding his behaving in a hostile manner towards a CHP officer. A documentation is also available on this.

Reporting Officer, upon reviewing these points of interest, elected to initiate an investigation.

On 6-10-77, contact was made with one Karen [REDACTED], WFA, 25 years, [REDACTED] phone [REDACTED]. Reporting Officer requested an interview with Miss [REDACTED] in regard to the above mentioned incident with Darlene Ferrin. She complied.

sitting for Dean and Darlene Ferrin. Again, reiterated the months were from January through May of 1969. Stated she quit in May to overcome some guilt that she was feeling about covering up for Darlene's running around with other men while she was married to Dean. One of the men mentioned was the surviving victim in the Vallejo homicide Michael Mageau.

Karen relates one incident that allegedly occurred while she was babysitting in approximately February or March 1969 at 560 Wallace. She stated she was babysitting approximately 10:00 p.m. one night, was looking out the front window of the Ferrin's apartment, and she noticed a man whom she took to be middleaged sitting in a white American-made sedan watching the apartment. She stated he was there for several hours but left before Dean returned from work shortly after midnight. She stated she could not really describe this individual and only knew he was middleaged because he either turned on the inside car light or lit a cigarette so that she got a partial look at the man. She did not note the license number and was only certain of the approximate age - middleaged, and the fact that the sedan was white.

The following day she related this incident to Darlene Ferrin who at the time recalled was in the bathroom putting on her makeup to go out. Darlene asked her what the car and the man looked like, and after relating a description to her, Dee said something to the effect, ""I guess he's checking up on me again. I heard he was back from out of state."" Followed by, ""He doesn't want anyone to know what I (meaning Darlene) saw him do. I saw him murder someone.""

Karen stated that Dee sometime during this conversation mentioned the man's name, and that the first name was very short, three or four letters and that the second name was just slightly longer. The name was quite common. Karen stated that Dee appeared to be genuinely frightened of this individual.

and mentioned sometime that he had been checking up on her at Terry's Restaurant where Darlene was employed.

At the conclusion of her statement, Reporting Officer discussed with Karen the possibility of her recalling exactly what the name might have been, and a better description of the individual if she were to undergo hypnosis. Stated that she never had any experience with this, but that she would be willing to submit to anything that may assist in the investigation. At this time Reporting Officer advised Karen that arrangements would be made for a session with a hypnotist to see if we could produce more information, and that Reporting Officer would be in contact.

On 6-15-77, Reporting Officer contacted Lieutenant Larry Haynes, Concord Police Department, phone 415-671-3030, in regards to the hypnotic session. Lieutenant Haynes has been trained in this by the Law Enforcement Hypnotic Institute in Los Angeles Police Department and has had much experience in this area. When asked as to the feasibility of such an examination with an 8-year time span, Lieutenant Haynes replied much success has been had regardless of the number of years that has passed. Advised Lieutenant Haynes that the interview primarily would focus on Karen's ability to recall a name told to her by the Zodiac victim Darlene Ferrin and possibly focus on a painting party that occurred at Darlene Ferrin's residence where possibly the alleged subject was in attendance. Lieutenant Haynes agreed to assist. An appointment was made for 6-16-77 at 1300 hours. Reporting Officer then re-contacted Karen [REDACTED], advised her of the appointment set for 1300 hours. She agreed to meet Reporting Officer at the Vallejo Police Department.

Wollheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_A._Wollheim), was a leader in the development of science fiction as a popular genre) remembers:
> The high point of my childhood experience at conventions was Baycon 1968 in Oakland. I remember the excitement of it all—sliding down the fire slides, the big eucalyptus forest behind the Claremont Hotel...the tournaments on the lawn.... And I remember at the age of 16 thinking, ""No convention can ever be this wonderful again, so I should never go to another.""

David wore brown corduroy pants, a light-blue, long-sleeve shirt, and low-cut brown boots. David and Betty Lou told Mr. and Mrs. Jensen they were going to a festival at Hogan High.

COMPLETE DETAILS OF CRIME AND DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY
This investigation is being conducted by Sergeant Charles J. McNatt, Patterson Police Department. In an attempt to evaluate the circumstances surrounding the alleged kidnapping of Mrs. Kathleen Johns, 617 Campus Way, San Bernardino, California, and her 10-month-old daughter Jennifer, on Interstate 5, north of Patterson at about 2315 hours, 3/22/70.
On the morning of 23 March 1970, at about 0230 hours, Mrs. Kathleen Johns was brought to the Patterson Police Department in a hysterical condition. When Mrs. Johns was quieted it was learned from her that a car had followed her from Modesto on Highway 132, and began blinking the lights in an attempt to get her to stop which she refused to do. Mrs. Johns states that after she had entered Interstate 5 that the vehicle then passed her, and at this time she stopped to check her car and was flagged to the wrong side of the road by a male subject who had been following her, had stopped, and had backed up the freeway. The man got out and advised her that the wheel on her car was wobbling and that he would fix it for her, that he began to take off a tire wrench and appeared to be tightening the lug bolts on her left rear wheel. The man then got into his own car and drove off without saying anything. Mrs. Johns then got into her own car and as she started driving off the wheel came off her car, whereupon the subject came back and said he would drive her to a service station. Mrs. Johns then got her infant into the car with the subject and he drove her around for what seemed to be an hour and a half or more, driving on back roads and stopping and turning around several times. She said he kept mumbling about killing people and throwing their bodies out of cars, and that he told her he was going to kill her and throw her baby out after he did so.
She said nothing during the ride and that at one point she attempted to get away, and he said if she did he would kill her. After driving around for some time the suspect’s car stopped at an intersection and Mrs. Johns grabbed her baby and ran across a field, hiding in a ditch until she saw the suspect drive off. She then walked or hitchhiked approximately two miles to the nearest road where she was picked up by a passing motorist and brought to the Patterson Police Department.
Mrs. Johns described the suspect as a white male, approximately 30 years old, 5'9"" in height, 160 lbs., dark hair, dark complexion, wearing a dark windbreaker jacket and black slacks. She stated she could identify him if seen again.
Mrs. Johns described the suspect’s car as a late-model tan or light brown sedan, possibly a 1957 or 1958 Chevrolet, with a spotlight on the left front fender. She stated there were no license plates on the front or rear of the vehicle.
Investigation revealed that Mrs. Johns’ vehicle, a brown 1957 Chevrolet station wagon, had been located burned approximately two miles west of Interstate 5 and one mile north of Highway 132. The vehicle was completely destroyed by fire, with the lug bolts on the left rear wheel missing. Deputy Lovett of the San Joaquin County Sheriff’s Office stated that a preliminary investigation showed the fire to be of incendiary origin.
Mrs. Johns and her infant daughter were taken to the San Joaquin General Hospital for observation and later released.
Inspector Tyrell of the San Joaquin County Sheriff’s Office and the San Francisco Police Department were contacted regarding the possibility of this case being connected with the so-called “Zodiac” suspect who has been operating in Northern California. Inspector Tyrell asked that a full report be sent to his office.
DEPARTMENT OF POLICE — CITY OF PATTERSON
 P.O. Box 667 — Patterson, Ca. 95363
 Alex X. Kosch — Chief of Police
 Phone (209) 892-2031
By this department it was found that this was the first time the initial report from Mrs. Johns and that the report was to be sent to the Homicide Division, attention Inspector Armstrong and Inspector Toschi.
When this office made contact with Inspector Tyrell no names were mentioned, only the bulletin number and SFPD case number was used.
Burned vehicle was towed to Tracy on authority of the San Joaquin authorities who state that arson and kidnapping charges will be filed if and when the person is arrested.

 County of Stanislaus
Date: 3-23-70
 Type of Report: Continuation Report
 File No.: 052677
 Victim: JOHNS, Kathleen Ann
3-23-70 2:30 AM:
 Received a call from Patterson PD to meet the complainant at their station regarding an incident which occurred in the County area. Arrived at the Patterson PD at 2:50 AM.
Contacted the complainant who stated at approx. 11:15 PM, 3-22-70 she had been driving on Hwy. 132 near Interstate 5 when she observed a late model vehicle, light tan in color, no other description, following her and blinking its lights as if the operator of the vehicle desired the complainant to stop. Complainant stated she stopped her vehicle, a 1957 Chevrolet S/W bearing Calif. Lic. HOU 518, somewhere in the area of Hwy. 132 and Interstate 5. She advised that the exact area is unfamiliar to her and that she was not sure where the vehicle had been stopped.
Complainant stated that a WMA, approx. 30 yrs., 5’9”, 160 lbs., dark hair, wearing blk. rimmed plastic glasses, wearing a dark jacket and dark trousers, blue bell-bottomed pants, approached her vehicle and advised her that her left rear wheel of her vehicle was wobbling and that he would repair the malfunction. Complainant stated she stayed in her vehicle and observed the suspect tighten the lug nuts of the rear tire of her vehicle and upon completion then advised her the wheel was okay at this time and that she could proceed. The complainant then observed the suspect pull away from the roadway and across the area.
Complainant stated she started her vehicle and was attempting to pull away from the curb when the vehicle came to a lurching stop at which time she exited the vehicle in an attempt to ascertain what the problem was. She discovered that the left rear wheel had fallen off the vehicle and it had only been secured by one lug bolt. She stated at that time she observed the suspect return in his vehicle and he advised her he would transport her to a service station in order to have the vehicle repaired. The complainant entered the suspect’s vehicle carrying her small daughter, approx. 10 mos., and left the area under the pretense that the suspect was attempting to locate a service station.
Complainant stated the suspect drove around in the County area, possibly near Tracy, for approx. one and a half hours and would not allow her to leave his vehicle. She stated at one time he said, “I’m going to kill you and throw your baby out after you.” Complainant stated that beyond that, the suspect made no sexual advances toward her and merely eluded the question of stating anything further.
She was quite frightened, feeling that possibly the suspect intended to do some physical injury to her and that when the suspect stopped at a stop sign, she grabbed her daughter and ran away from the car into the fields and hid until she saw a passing motorist, who transported her to the Patterson Police Department.
Complainant stated the suspect’s vehicle was light tan in color, possibly a 1957 or 1958 Chevrolet, with one spotlight on the left front fender, and there were no license plates on the vehicle.
The person transporting the complainant were not present upon this writer’s arrival, therefore their names remain unknown at this time.
Complainant advised that she was not injured during the incident, nor her daughter had not been harmed.

Text: Sirs—I would like to expression my consternt consternation concerning your poor taste & lack of sympathy for the public, as evidenced by your running of the ads for the movie ""Badlands,"" featuring the blurb—""In 1959 most people were killing time. Kit & Holly were killing people."" In light of recent events, this kind of murder-glorification can only be deplorable at best (not that glorification of violence was ever justifiable) why don't you show some concern for public sensibilities & cut the ad?

This is the Zodiac speaking.
I am the murderer of the taxi driver over by Washington St & Maple St last night, to prove this here is a blood stained piece of his shirt. I am the same man who did in the people in the north bay area.
The S.F. Police could have caught me last night if they had searched the park properly instead of holding road races with their motorcicles seeing who could make the most noise. The car drivers should have just parked their cars and sat there quietly waiting for me to come out of cover.
School children make nice targets, I think I shall wipe out a school bus some morning. Just shoot out the front tire & then pick off the kiddies as they come bouncing out.

Please Rush to Editor

This is the Zodiac speaking
Up to the end of Oct I have killed 7 people. I have grown rather angry with the police for their telling lies about me. So I shall change the way the collecting of slaves. I shall no longer announce to anyone. When I comitt my murders, they shall look like routine robberies, killings of anger, & a few fake accidents, etc.
The police shall never catch me, because I have been too clever for them.
1. I look like the description passed out only when I do my thing, the rest of the time I look entirle different. I shall not tell you what my descise consists of when I kill
2. As of yet I have left no fingerprints behind me contrary to what the police say in my killings I wear transparent finger tip guards. All it is is 2 coats of airplane cement coated on my finger tips—quite unnoticible & very efective.
3. my killing tools have been boughten through the mail order outfits before the ban went into efect. Except one & it was bought out of the state.
So as you can see the police don't have much to work on. If you wonder why I was wipeing the cab down I was leaving fake clews for the police to run all over town with, as one might say, I gave the cops som bussy work to do to keep them happy. I enjoy needling the blue pigs. Hey blue pig I was in the park—you were useing fire trucks to mask the sound of your cruzeing prowl cars. The dogs never came with in 2 blocks of me & they were to the west & there was only 2 groups of parking about 10 min apart then the motor cicles went by about 150 ft away going from south to north west.
Must print in paper [bolded areas below]
ps. 2 cops pulled a goof abot 3 min after I left the cab. I was walking down the hill to the park when this cop car pulled up & one of them called me over & asked if I saw anyone acting suspicious or strange in the last 5 to 10 min & I said yes there was this man who was runnig by waveing a gun & the cops peeled rubber & went around the corner as I directed them & I disappeared into the park a block & a half away never to be seen again.
Hey pig doesnt it rile you up to have your noze rubed in your booboos?
If you cops think I'm going to take on a bus the way I stated I was, you deserve to have holes in your heads.
Take one bag of ammonium nitrate fertilizer & 1 gal of stove oil & dump a few bags of gravel on top & then set the shit off & will positivily ventalate any thing that should be in the way of the blast.
The death machine is all ready made. I would have sent you pictures but you would be nasty enough to trace them back to developer & then to me, so I shall describe my masterpiece to you. The nice part of it is all the parts can be bought on the open market with no questions asked.
- 1 bat. pow clock—will run for aprox 1 year
- 1 photoelectric switch
- 2 copper leaf springs
- 2 6V car bat
- 1 flash light bulb & reflector
- 1 mirror
- 2 18"" cardboard tubes black with shoe polish in side & oute
the system checks out from one end to the other in my tests. What you do not know is whether the death machine is at the sight or whether it is being stored in my basement for future use. I think you do not have the manpower to stop this one by continually searching the road sides looking for this thing. & it wont do to re roat & re schedule the busses because the bomb can be adapted to new conditions.
Have fun!! By the way it could be rather messy if you try to bluff me.
PS. Be shure to print the part I marked out on page 3 or I shall do my thing ⌖

To prove that I am the Zodiac, Ask the Vallejo cop about my electric gun sight which I used to start my collecting of slaves.

recKFvrTEomZrRD6W,"""Sam"" doesn't show up at Fairmont Hotel",1969-10-22,43200,recXWIp8s3P3TAYiu,"**TV ‘Zodiac’ Reneges on Surrender**
_By Hubert J. Bernhard_

The hunt for the “Zodiac” killer focused on the Fairmont Hotel this afternoon in the wake of a television show that featured a man who represented himself as the mass slayer.

Nob Hill’s famed hostelry entered the picture after a mysterious caller fenced for two hours with questioners on the call-in show while a huge Bay Area audience watched.

The caller promised to meet a prominent attorney later in the morning and surrender. He failed to keep the rendezvous—but police were reported to have a suspect in which they were “strongly interested”—possibly as a result of the aborted meeting.

**Hotel Pickup**
It was after that that the Fairmont loomed as a key setting in the investigation.

Taxi driver Paul Stine, 29, the “Zodiac” killer’s latest victim, is believed to have picked up the man who killed him on the street in the vicinity of the Fairmont.

During the television broadcast this morning, the “voice” who repeatedly called the show told attorney Melvin Belli to meet him on the roof of the Fairmont—alone.

Bryan Hartnell, 20, who was wounded in the Lake Berryessa knife attack in which Cecilia Ann Shepard was killed by the “Zodiac” suspect, later listened to a replay of the entire television show.

When the tape came to the point where the caller mentioned the Fairmont, Hartnell asked to have it replayed. It was—repeatedly—for more than 20 minutes.

“Meet me on top of the Fairmont Hotel with nobody else, or I’ll jump,” the voice said.

**No Recognition**
Hartnell gave no outward signs of recognition, but that was the only portion of the tape he asked to hear again.

Hartnell, one of three persons who heard the replay in a sealed room, was asked about a possible identification of the voice afterward.

“I can’t say a word at this time,” he said. “We’re not sure. It’s too short to tell. We’re going to have another conference.”

During the television show, a waitress in the Blum’s candy shop at the Fairmont telephoned to report that a man who resembled circulated pictures of “Zodiac” had stopped in for a cup of coffee.

She reported that she had put the cup and saucer aside for examination by police fingerprint experts.

The television show—springboard for a sequence of new developments in the suspenseful search for the slayer—was arranged by police.

Capt. Martin Lee, chief of inspectors and head of San Francisco’s “Zodiac squad,” said police had no assurance that the mysterious caller was actually responsible for the five “Zodiac” murders.

“I think the caller has a problem,” he said, “but whether he’s involved in the killings, I cannot say.”

Lee said the strange television performance was set up after a man telephoned “a neighboring police department” about 11 p.m. last night and offered to negotiate.

**Sincere**
He was taken seriously, Lee explained, because he “seemed to have knowledge and he seemed sincere.”

San Francisco police did not talk to him directly, but they acceded to his request to have an attorney on the television show this morning to attempt to arrange a surrender.

Melvin Belli, one of two lawyers the caller asked for by name, appeared on Jim Dunbar’s regular KGO-TV morning talk show as a result.

A series of telephone calls ensued, at the end of which Belli—off the air—made a 10:30 date to meet the mystery man at St. Vincent de Paul’s Thrift Shop, 672 S. Mission Street.

**Broke Date**
He and Dunbar went there at the appointed time, and police arrived half an hour later when it appeared the caller had no intention of keeping the date.

Belli told reporters he hoped the man would telephone his office, saying he was “a very sick person and needs help.”

The rendezvous was arranged after Belli and Dunbar received 15 telephone calls during the two hours they were on the air.

Most were obviously from the same person, although several seemed to be in a different voice. Belli expressed concern that someone else was entering the dialogue.

The caller represented himself as suffering from headaches and twice declared he had the urge to “kill again.”

**Different Voice**
But _The Examiner_ learned that the police officer who took the original call that led to the broadcast said the voice on the Dunbar program was apparently not that of the man to whom he spoke.

During the broadcast, in which the Dunbar show was kept on the air more than half an hour past its normal cut-off time, one San Francisco police inspector described the odds they were dealing with as “like flipping a coin.”

**No More Calls**
Dunbar and Belli opened the conversation with the self-described killer by clearing the switchboard to accept no other calls than his at 7 a.m.

Police promised they would make no effort to trace the calls. The first call was at 7:14 a.m., during a commercial.

The audience heard Belli, when the commercial ended, saying:
“Did you hear me?”
“Yes, I did,” replied the caller in a soft, almost boyish voice.

He hung up, apparently because he was nervous. But he called back a few minutes later.

**Call Him ‘Sam’**
When Belli pleaded with him for a better name to address him by than “Zodiac,” the caller agreed to be referred to as “Sam.”

He asked a second time for a Fairmont rooftop meeting, setting no specific time for the rendezvous.

Dunbar and Belli assured him that the lines were not tapped, and that no attempt was made to trace the calls. They tried, too, to persuade him to say what police department he had called as evidence that he was indeed the man who initiated the conversations.

Dunbar and Belli tried to value “Sam” to identify the police department he’d contacted in order to determine whether they were dealing with the same man.

He parried their questions, however, and they never asked about the five murders charged to “Zodiac.”

Belli assured the caller of a fair trial and repeatedly asked whether he wanted the attorney to contact District Attorney John J. Ferdon with a promise that no effort would be made to send him to the gas chamber.

**Headaches**
The caller once said he suffered from “headaches,” adding that aspirin would not help. Then he hung up, and frequently during the strange sequence he said he was getting one again.

When he called again, Belli asked how long he had suffered from headaches.
“Ever since I killed that kid,” the caller replied.
“Was that before last December?”
“Yes.”

December was the month in which the first of the murders attributed to “Zodiac” took place.

Once when the caller hung up, he did so declaring: “I don’t want to give myself up. I want to kill those kids.”

Another time, he said as he hung up: “I’m getting one of my headaches now. I’ve got to kill. I’ve got to kill.”

Several times he made groaning sounds which explained by saying, “That’s my headache speaking.”

Belli finally promised he would contact the district attorney’s office about leniency, and then he and Dunbar ended the show after agreeing to meet the caller “inside” at Daly City.

District Attorney Ferdon said later that his office had not been contacted by Belli, but that he would make no deals.

“There’s nothing we will promise,” Ferdon said. “We are in no position to make promises to anyone named Zodiac. We don’t know whether Belli is representing this voice or not.

“When the evidence is brought before us, then we will make a decision as to our proceedings.”

**No Evidence**
The mysterious caller said nothing during the television show that could be taken as evidence he was indeed the man sought by officers of four jurisdictions.

Police in San Francisco and Vallejo, together with the Napa and Solano County sheriff’s offices, meanwhile set up a “hot line” for instant communication on the “Zodiac” case.

All departments have been involved in the investigation of murders attributed to the killer.

The close contact resulted from Monday’s meeting here to exchange every scrap of evidence and information involving the three murders in Vallejo lovers’ lanes, one at Lake Berryessa and the latest here.

The killer who calls himself Zodiac has boasted of the murders in cryptograms and letters sent to _The Examiner._

Meanwhile, Chief Inspectors Lee confirmed of slugs taken from victims yesterday that ballistic tests and shell casings show that the killer used three and possibly four different weapons in his reign of terror.

It was known previously that a .22-caliber pistol was used to shoot and kill Betty Lou Jensen, 16, and her boyfriend, David Faraday, 17, in a lovers’ lane near Vallejo last Dec. 20.

A 9-mm pistol killed Darlene Ferrin, 23, and critically wounded Michael Mageau, 19, in another lovers’ lane at Blue Rock Springs Park in Vallejo last July 5.

A knife with a six- to eight-inch blade took the life of Miee Shepard, who was stabbed more than 20 times, and critically wounded her companion, Hartnell, who has recovered from 12 stabs.

A 9-mm pistol took the life of Stine, 29. The slug taken from his body was too smashed to make a comparison with those in the Vallejo murder. It may or may not have been the same gun.

Narrative (page 1)
Upon responding to the above location, officers Peda and Pelissetti found Yellow Cab #912 parked at the northeast corner of Washington St. at the corner of Cherry St.
The reporter, together with two other witnesses—[ages 13 and 14], same address and phone—stated that they saw the below-described suspect seated in the front seat of the cab, on the passenger side, with the victim slumped partially over his lap. The suspect appeared to be searching the victim’s pockets. (Witnesses never heard a gunshot.)
The suspect was observed wiping [fingerprints] on the interior of the cab, leaning over the victim toward the driver’s side. He then exited the cab from the right-hand passenger door, walked around to the driver’s side, and wiped the exterior and interior surfaces near the driver’s door and dashboard.
The suspect then walked north on Cherry St. toward Jackson St. The witnesses immediately notified the police.
Responding officers checked the interior of the cab and found the victim slumped over the front seat, head in the passenger area, blood flowing from a wound to the right rear of the head. Fire Department Rescue responded; victim pronounced dead at 10:10 p.m.
Inspector Krake and Inspector Toschi notified. The crime lab was called to the scene. Photos taken; body removed to the morgue.
The meter of the cab was still running, reading $6.25 at 10:46 p.m., indicating the victim may have picked up the fare at approximately 9:40 p.m.

Titled ""Sick of living/unwilling to die"", the poem's language and handwriting resembled that of the Zodiac's letters. It was signed with what were assumed to be a set of lower case initials (_r h_).[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Cheri_Jo_Bates#cite_note-43) The desk in question was in the college storage area at the time the poem was discovered, although the custodian informed police the desk had been on the library floor at the time of Bates's murder.

### **HIGH SPEED CRASH KILLS AIRMAN, 20**
A 20-year-old airman was killed and a companion was injured early today in a high-speed auto accident at Numa in Parke County.

Dead is **Robert A. McManus**. Suffering a fractured leg and broken jaw is **Gary Poste**, 20. Both were stationed at an Air Force installation at Rockville. Their home towns were not immediately identified.

Police said the car, driven by McManus, left U.S. 41, bounced off the west side of a C. & E. I. Railroad underpass and slammed into the east side of the underpass.

The crash occurred at 3:15 a.m. (CDT).

Yesterday, a 70-year-old South Bend man died of injuries suffered four days earlier when his auto went out of control and struck a tree.

Police said **Roy S. Young** may have become ill before the accident. His death was the first traffic fatality in St. Joseph County this year.

Gary F. Poste, 22-year-old Fortuna man reportedly accidentally shot by a police officer friend Thursday night at the latter’s home in that city, was reported “greatly improved” at Redwood Memorial Hospital today.

Poste still remains on the critical list, however, until danger of possible complications is past.

Meanwhile, the district attorney’s office indicated it will conduct an investigation of its own into the matter. Deputy District Attorney James McKittrick stated he was certain that, due to “peculiar” circumstances, it will be checked into by D.A. investigators.

Poste was shot with a .357 caliber magnum revolver held by patrolman Robert Foster, 24, a member of the Fortuna Police Department for only two months. Police Chief Dale L. Livingston said the shooting was obviously accidental, adding that the victim had himself said so yesterday morning.

The center of his affections is at the Youth Guidance Center as a runaway. She is 14.
Best, who says he makes a living by selling rare books and documents he brings to the U.S. from Mexico, claims he married her in Reno Jan. 5.
But the girl’s parents got the marriage annulled.

reclhJB0SUxpuBhTG,Earl Van Best & child bride are on the run,1962-08-31,,,"## **Ailing Child Bride, Spouse Disappear**
8/31/1962

The ailing child bride of Earl Van Best, 28, disappeared from her San Francisco General Hospital room early today, clad only in a short hospital gown.

Van Best, free on $10,000 bail on child stealing charges, also was found missing from his San Francisco apartment at 514 Noe St.

Police issued an alert to watch for the lovers after the girl’s mother suggested he may have aided in her escape.

The 14-year-old girl, reportedly pregnant, was taken to the hospital suffering from infectious hepatitis, a liver ailment.

Dr. Mary McAnaw of the hospital staff said the ailment has been partially arrested but that she could suffer a relapse unless she is under medical supervision.

First taken to the Youth Guidance Center as a runaway, she was transferred to the hospital about 10 days ago. Mrs. Harris said she was in bed at 4 a.m. but missing at 8 a.m.

The ill-fated romance of Earl Van Best, a rare book salesman, and the school girl blossomed in a San Francisco ice cream parlor.

He called it “love at first sight.”

Their Reno marriage in January subsequently was annulled by the girl’s parents. They were taken into custody at the home of her mother, Mrs. Verda Mae Kitli [Kitty/Kitt], at 1245 7th Ave., San Francisco, late in July after a trip through the Midwest, Southwest and Mexico. The girl had gone there to pick up some clothes.

## **Car Gives Clue in Child Bride Hunt**
### **Bulletin Out for Arrest of Pair in ‘2nd Elopement’**
9/1/1962

A 14-year-old girl, who presumably eloped a second time with her 28-year-old “rare book dealer” husband today was called back to San Francisco for a variety of reasons.

She apparently bears none of them.

Neither does Earl Van Best, 28, a book salesman, with whom she is believed to have spent the most recent and parental interruption.

Detectives want the girl to continue the hepatitis treatment she was getting earlier at San Francisco General Hospital. She disappeared early yesterday, clad only in a hospital gown. Officers want Van Best on child-stealing and other charges.

And her mother, Mrs. Verdanne Kittiman, of 1245 7th Ave., San Francisco, wants the girl back.

A statewide bulletin was issued for the arrest of Van Best and the girl, said to be four months pregnant, and for a yellow 1961 Falcon they were seen in in Cabillo Way at 514 Noe St., before they again vanished.

The couple met in an ice cream parlor last fall and eloped to Reno, where a January marriage was annulled by the girl’s parents. However, the pair disappeared and turned up a month later at the mother’s house after a “honeymoon” through the Southwest and Mexico.

Van Best was arrested on a child-stealing charge, freed on bail, and his case was continued in court. The girl was made a ward of the Juvenile Court and sent to the Youth Guidance Center as a runaway.

She later was transferred to San Francisco General Hospital when she became ill.

Dr. Mary McAnaw said the girl’s ailment had improved under antibiotics and subject to relapse.

**Ice Cream Romance Ends In Jail**

**SAN FRANCISCO (AP)** —
A love story that began in an ice cream parlor has ended with a 28-year-old man in jail for statutory rape and his 15-year-old sweetheart in a home for wayward girls.

The story got its start about a year ago when Earl Van Best Jr., a book salesman, and blonde Judy Chandler, then 14, met and fell in love in Herbert’s Sherbet Shoppe.

They ran away to Nevada, got married—and then Judy’s family found out. The marriage was annulled and Best was jailed for child stealing.

He was freed on bail but helped Judy escape from a hospital where she was ill with hepatitis. Once again, they fled. In April, they were found in New Orleans, where—police said—Best had wrapped Judy’s newborn child in a towel and left it on a doorstep. The child later was adopted by foster parents.

Best was sentenced to a year in San Francisco County Jail yesterday. A one- to 50-year state prison sentence was suspended, and a child-stealing charge dropped.

Two Vallejo youths were arrested by police shortly after midnight Thursday after their car plowed into a pickup parked in the 200 block of B Street.

Officers said a compact driven north on B Street by James W. Sturgess, 18, of 1207 Warren Ave., struck the parked truck registered to Bruce Smith, of 231 B St., inflicting moderate damage.

Sturgess was treated for bruised hands and Myers was given first aid for multiple abrasions and bruises of the forehead and knee as well as cuts on the nose and above the left eye.

**‘Thefts-On-Order’ Setup Took Goods Valued At $10,000**

Vallejo police juvenile officers announced Saturday the cracking of a “burglary by order” ring, and arrested two men and eight juveniles as participants in the operation in which loot worth at least $10,000 was stolen from 53 South Vallejo homes since November. Sgt. Harold Thacker, officer in charge of the Juvenile Department, said the suspects all were Caucasians. He and Officers Jim Husted and Lee Vaughn had been working on the case almost unceasingly for weeks.

“It’s one of the slickest operations we’ve ever come up against,” Husted said. “It wasn’t until we were able to develop a pattern of house burglaries in South Vallejo that we were able to solve it.”

As of Saturday afternoon, police had recovered approximately $3,500 worth of stolen goods.

**Two Charged**
The adults who were jailed were identified as Casimiro (Casey) Saavedra, 26, of 137 Jordan St., and Louis Myers, 19, of 1182 Lewis Ave. Both were charged with possession of stolen property. Saavedra was freed on bail of $2,000, and the same bail figure was set for Myers who remains in custody.

Husted said the men who were jailed owned the ring but hired the “little orders” for Saavedra, who allegedly advised them on the types of articles he wanted. “For example,” the officer said, “the youngsters, all in their mid-teen bracket, might be told to obtain an electric organ, a TV set, gun, or a watch.”

The “Fagin” involved in the operation even provided the accomplices with transportation to the homes that were to be robbed, Husted said.

**Thefts**
Husted said the series of burglaries began as long ago as last May.

“But the ring, as far as we can determine, wasn’t organized until November, then things really started rolling,” he added.

In a single block, he said, as many as five homes were burglarized during the three months the burglary ring was operating at its peak.

Most of the loot recovered was stored in Saavedra’s house, officers said. The suspect, however, denied any knowledge of the crime and told police the articles in his home were recovered by him after his home was burglarized.

The mystifying case was solved almost by happenstance, Husted said.

It was reported to him by a local school principal that a youth was attempting to sell a watch at school.

“We looked him up, saw the watch, and thought it was quite a bit more expensive a watch than a boy his age ought to have,” Husted went on.

Upon questioning, the boy admitted the watch had been taken in a house burglary, and implicated a second youth.

“One thing led to another, but it wasn’t all that easy,” Husted said. “For example, we had to research all the burglaries that had occurred in Vallejo in recent months to determine from the reports the methods used and the sort of merchandise that was taken.

“We think we have cleared up 53 house break-ins — there may be more.”

The youths that were booked either have been released in the custody of their parents, or are being detained in Juvenile Hall, Fairfield.

Thacker said the boys told him they were paid specified amounts for items stolen, such as $30 for the electric organ, $25 for a hunting rifle, and varying sums for jewelry, depending on its value.

“These kids were as clever as adult professionals,” Thacker added. “They always wore gloves so they wouldn’t leave any fingerprints, and they never carried burglar tools.”

They also never committed any acts of vandalism in any house they entered. Entry, incidentally, almost always was gained by smashing a window, or opening a screen.

“It’s a relief to have these burglaries cleared up,” Sergeant Thacker commented. “The whole department has been working night and day to solve them.”

No date has been set for the Municipal Court arraignments of Saavedra and Myers. The youths’ cases will be taken up in Juvenile Court.

**“Very Brave Man”**

_Editor of The Bee — Sir:_ After reading the article _“Modestan Offers To Be Killer’s Victim”_ on the front page of _The Bee_ Oct. 23, I would just like to say Joe Stine is a very brave man. He has put his life in jeopardy to save others. He has said he will not be carrying any weapon and will further be riding a bicycle to and from his job. There is a very good chance the Zodiac killer will take Stine up on his offer and how will he protect himself?

Every night I read the paper and watch young men on the news demonstrating against the war in Vietnam. I cannot help but feel they could not possibly think it is immoral as many of them do not know the meaning of the word as they smoke their pot and advocate free love. They are just not man enough to fight, no matter what the cause. Stine has proved he is a man and a very brave one at that. There are not enough around.

I attended Hughson High School with Joe Stine’s brother, Paul Stine, one of the Zodiac’s victims, and feel we have lost a very fine person. I hope we can show Joe Stine and his mother we care. I am sending a small donation to help start a fund to buy Stine an automobile for the cold wet days ahead and I hope many more will join in. Just imagine what $1 from each reader could do.

**HUGHSON** — Paul Stine of Hughson and Howard Hobbs of Fresno are two Fresno State College students who will be learning the inside of politics under internships established by the Citizenship Clearing House of California.

Stine, a Democrat, has been assigned to the Democratic County Central Committee to aid Bert Delotto, a Fresno County Supervisor campaigning for assemblyman from the 32nd Fresno district, and Charles B. Garrigus, who is seeking to unseat the incumbent assemblyman from the 33rd district.

**THE YOUTHS** will receive $50 a week for 10 weeks. The clearinghouse, with a grant from the Ford Foundation, is providing half the money and the central committees the remainder. Each will work beside his candidate, learning what is involved in political campaigning.

In a quote from Dr. Karl Falk, head of the college social science division, the boys “will learn how to ring doorbells and make individual vote solicitations, will learn precinct organization work, will learn how speaking engagements are sought and how they are filled and how press releases are prepared.”

“**THE ONLY** requirement is that they get a good cross section of a local political campaign and not be assigned some routine task. A similar program is in effect in Los Angeles County. The two are parts of a pilot program and, if successful, may result in much wider application of the ‘political internship’ arrangement in coming years.”

**BOTH YOUNG** men feel they may enter the political field themselves in the future.

Stine, 18 years old and in his first year at F.S.C., will be unable to vote for his candidates in November, but states, “I plan to make up for that, and more, by ardent campaigning.”

His work is in addition to a part-time job as a dishwasher in a drive-in restaurant, to finance his way through college.

Before graduating from Hughson Union High School in 1957, Stine worked in the peach harvest and was a sports writer for the school, representing the _Turlock Journal._ Last summer he was employed full time for the _Journal_ as sports editor.

reczltHpLubixtS56,Schilling released; Toschi doubts as suspect,1969-10-30,,"recXWIp8s3P3TAYiu,recBvEdu6ENXUDRGy","On October 28–30, 1969, Las Vegas police arrested **Gary Ronald Schilling**, 27, of Gardena (or Los Angeles), California, after finding him asleep in his car on the Las Vegas Strip. Deputies discovered a **.380 Beretta** and a **.22 caliber pistol** in the vehicle and charged him with possession of **unregistered firearms**. Because the calibers matched those used in the Zodiac killings, Schilling was briefly detained on a **murder hold** as a potential suspect in the Zodiac case.
Fingerprints and handwriting samples were sent to **San Francisco Police** for comparison, but investigators—including **Inspector Dave Toschi** of the Zodiac task force—quickly expressed skepticism. Toschi described Schilling as “one of about 5,000 suspects who resembled our composite,” adding that “it’s just a routine check. Somebody jumped the gun on this and it’s gotten completely out of hand.”
Other SFPD officials noted that Schilling’s features did not match the Zodiac composite sketch and that there was “nothing exceptional about this suspect.” Officers emphasized that the similarities in weapon caliber were coincidental and that Schilling did **not** resemble the Zodiac.
Authorities confirmed that Schilling was also wanted in **Downey, California**, for a loitering charge. After questioning by Las Vegas detectives, he was released when no connection to the Zodiac murders was found.

////////

**Another False Alarm In Zodiac Case**
SAN FRANCISCO (UPI) — Homicide investigators said today a man being held in Las Vegas as a possible suspect in the Zodiac murders “doesn’t look like anything that we’re interested in at all.”
Inspector Dave Toschi, one of the team assigned to the Zodiac case, said Gary Ronald Schilling, 27, Los Angeles, was “one of about 5,000 suspects who resembled our composite (picture) of Zodiac that we’ve checked.”
“We can’t positively rule him out until we receive his fingerprints,” the inspector said. “But it’s just a routine check. Somebody jumped the gun on this and it’s gotten completely out of hand.”
Schilling was arrested on the Las Vegas Strip Tuesday night for possession of unregistered firearms. He was later booked on a hold for murder as a possible suspect in the five Bay Area killings of recent months.
Toschi said Schilling had been questioned at length about the Zodiac killings by Las Vegas detectives and didn’t seem to be a likely suspect.
Schilling was arrested when deputies found him sleeping in the back of his car in the parking lot of a hotel. They found a .380 beretta and a .22 caliber pistol in the car.
Fingerprints and handwriting samples were sent to San Francisco police to determine if there is any connection between the man and the so-called Zodiac killer.
Authorities in San Francisco have attributed five murders in recent months to a person who has called himself Zodiac in letters to police and newspapers boasting of the murders.

**SUSPECT HAD TWO GUNS**
An Inglewood man, who does not resemble the composite sketch of Zodiac, psychotic slayer of five persons, is being checked out as a possible suspect because he had two guns of the same caliber as the ones used by Zodiac, San Francisco police said today.
The fingerprint and handwriting comparisons have not yet been completed, an officer said.
Gary Ronald Schilling, 27, was picked up for investigation after Las Vegas police found him sleeping in his car and armed with a .22 caliber pistol and a foreign-make 9 mm. automatic, police reported.
One officer indicated skepticism about the case, saying the San Francisco police have checked dozens of similar suspects during their Zodiac investigation. “There’s nothing exceptional about this suspect,” the officer said. “And his features do not match those in the composite drawing.”
In discussing Zodiac, the San Francisco officer said that although the murderer is unique in devising the cryptogram and contacting police after his slayings, he is not necessarily a trained cryptographer.
“He could have gone to any library and gotten a book to help him create the three-part cipher,” the officer said.

**Suspect Said Not Zodiac**
SAN FRANCISCO (UPI) — Homicide investigators said today a man being held in Las Vegas as a possible suspect in the Zodiac murders “doesn’t look like anything that we’re interested in at all.”
Inspector Dave Toschi, one of the team assigned to the Zodiac case, said Gary Ronald Schilling, 27, Los Angeles, was “one of about 5,000 suspects who resembled our composite (picture) of Zodiac that we’ve checked.”
“We can’t positively rule him out until we receive his fingerprints,” the inspector said. “But it’s just a routine check. Somebody jumped the gun on this and it’s gotten completely out of hand.”

Toschi said Schilling had been questioned at length about the Zodiac killings by Las Vegas detectives and didn’t seem to be a likely suspect.

**Zodiac Suspect Probed**
LAS VEGAS (UPI) — A man arrested on a firearms charge has been booked on a hold for murder in California and is being checked out as a possible suspect in the San Francisco Zodiac murders.
Clark County sheriff’s detectives said Wednesday that Gary Ronald Schilling, 27, Gardena, Calif., was arrested on the Las Vegas Strip for possession of unregistered firearms.
The car in which he was arrested was registered at 14517 S. Vermont, Gardena.
Los Angeles police said Schilling was also wanted in Downey, Calif., on a loitering charge.
Schilling was arrested when deputies found him sleeping in the back of his car in the parking lot of a hotel. They found a .380 beretta and a .22 caliber pistol in the car.
Fingerprints and handwriting samples were sent to San Francisco police to determine if there is any connection between the man and the so-called Zodiac killer.
Authorities in San Francisco have attributed five murders in recent months to a person who has called himself Zodiac in letters to police and newspapers boasting of the murders.
San Francisco police said they had received information from Las Vegas authorities but added that their investigation of the suspect was not complete.

recuRzsPXK5QynZ2S,Children urged to skip Trick 'R Treat,1969-10-30,,recT4sMRyAv9Sk1zs,"**ON HALLOWEEN**
 **Children Urged To Stay At Home**
Traditional “Trick or Treat” by small fry in Vallejo residential areas on Halloween are being discouraged this year by Vallejo Chief of Police **Jack E. Stiltz**, and by **Dr. John W. Nicoll**, superintendent of the Vallejo Unified School District, because of the threat posed by the “Zodiac Killer.”
Dr. Nicoll said Wednesday notices are being sent to parents of all children in the pre-school through sixth grade years, saying he endorses Chief Stiltz’ request that trick or treat activities be discontinued this year.
“Although notices are not being sent to parents of junior and senior high school students, I nevertheless urge these parents to take a good look at the situation and follow the police chief’s advice,” Dr. Nicoll added.
The school notice to parents reads:
 “The Vallejo Unified School District is cooperating closely with the Vallejo Police Department in an endeavor to protect our children from the menace of the so-called Zodiac Killer. Accordingly, I wish to endorse Chief Jack E. Stiltz’ request that the traditional trick or treat activities be discontinued this year, particularly with young children.
“To quote Chief Jack Stiltz: ‘I realize that in asking for this cooperation from the parents, that many young people who have been looking forward to this annual trick and treat fun will be disappointed. I regret it very much, but I feel that it is too great a risk to take when a killer is at large, such as the Zodiac Killer,’” the superintendent’s notice concluded.
Several days ago, after claiming his fifth victim since last Dec. 20 — four in Solano and Napa counties — Zodiac wrote the San Francisco police department his next target might be a school bus. Accordingly, school buses have been guarded since, on their runs to and from school.
No attempts have been made on school buses since the threat.

**Karen Long Weds Ronald Gene Allen**

Of interest to their many local friends is news of the marriage of **Ronald Gene Allen**, the son of Cmdr. and Mrs. E. W. Allen of Vallejo, and **Karen Marie Long**, the daughter of Mrs. James Wilcox Long of San Gabriel. The marriage was solemnized on **November 26 at 8 o’clock in the evening** at the **San Marino Congregational Church**, with the **Rev. Bertrand R. Crist** officiating.

The bride was given in marriage by her grandfather, **Alfred R. Dumas**. Her _lovely_ gown of ivory brocade was designed by Gallina, in a simple A-line with a very full, long train falling from the shoulders. A large bow of the same fabric as the gown framed her face and her veil was of ivory silk illusion in cathedral length. Slippers of ivory satin with rosettes on the toes and wrist-length white kid gloves completed her bridal costume. She carried a presentation bouquet of small white roses.

**Miss Linda Cathcart of Burbank** attended as maid of honor, wearing a gown of gold faille in an A-line design with a panel back. A bow of the same gold faille with a double veil of gold illusion, shoulder-length, and matching slippers were her accessories.

The two bridesmaids, **Miss Mary Eilers of Upland** and **Miss Stephanie Hoffman**, a cousin of the bride from Corona Del Mar, wore identical gowns to that of the maid of honor and carried long-stemmed red roses.

Serving as best man was the groom’s brother, **Leigh Allen of Berson, California**, and ushers were **Jere French of Pomona** and **James Hoffman of Corona Del Mar**.

For her daughter’s wedding, Mrs. Long chose a gown of cinnamon-colored chiffon cut velvet with long sleeves gathered at the wrist and a round collar at the throat. She wore a cinnamon-toned stole hat and matching shoes and handbag; her corsage was of green orchids.

The groom’s mother wore a mint-green and orchid brocade jacket ensemble, with a small green satin hat and matching shoes; her flowers were a corsage of bronze cymbidium orchids.

A **reception** followed at the **South Pasadena Women’s Club**, where members of the wedding party and both families greeted guests. Assisting at the reception and in charge of the guest book was **Miss Jean Hoffman** of Corona Del Mar, cousin of the bride.

For her traveling costume, the new Mrs. Allen wore a textured white silk suit with thin black and gold stripes forming a plaid pattern. The couple planned to make their home in **San Francisco**, where the bride was attending **San Francisco State College**.

Mrs. Allen is a graduate of **California Polytechnic College** and spent her junior year at the **University of Stockholm in Sweden**. The groom is also a graduate of California Polytechnic College.

[Address redacted]

**081691**

Pursuant to a previous telephone conversation with Michael MAGEAU, I made arrangements with him to meet at the Ontario Airport in San Bernardino County. These arrangements were made for him and I to meet in front of the security office in this airport at 10:30 a.m. on 081691. I flew to Ontario Airport, arriving shortly after 10:00 a.m. I met MAGEAU promptly at 10:30 a.m. in front of the security office. MAGEAU was accompanied by an older white female that I would estimate to be in early 60’s. MAGEAU explained that he lived with this female and her husband in the residence in [redacted].

It should be noted at this time that MAGEAU was the surviving person in the Zodiac Killing which occurred on 070469. I briefly asked MAGEAU about the incident. MAGEAU indicated that he did, in fact, get a view of the responsible’s face. It was a very short duration of time as the responsible had shined a flashlight into his face and almost immediately began shooting him. He then switched the flashlight over to the area where the other person in the vehicle with him, Darlene FERRIN, was seated, and began shooting her. MAGEAU indicated that it was during this span of time that he was able to see the individual who had shot him.



### **PAGE 2 OF 5**

I advised MAGEAU that I had a group of photographs which I wished to show him, and that the responsible who shot him on July 4, 1969 may or may not be amongst these photographs, and merely because I was showing him pictures, he did not have to identify anyone. MAGEAU indicated he understood this.

I showed MAGEAU a photographic lineup containing six photographs. The fourth photograph to the right in this lineup is that of Arthur Leigh ALLEN. MAGEAU viewed this lineup for approximately 15 or 20 seconds. He then placed his finger on the photograph of Arthur Leigh ALLEN stating, “That’s him.” I asked MAGEAU how sure he was, and he indicated he was pretty sure; that the responsible had a round face like that, and then he pointed to the picture on the right of another individual. The picture he was now pointing to was that of a person whom I could only read the first [redacted]. The lineup is made up primarily of soundex driver’s licenses which have been stapled together, and I do not want to further remove the staples from this lineup at this time to more positively identify this individual.

I asked MAGEAU if he was also identifying this photograph. He emphatically stated “No,” just that the picture also had a round face like that of the picture that he had identified of ALLEN. I asked MAGEAU on a scale of 1–10 how sure he was of his identification of the photograph of ALLEN. MAGEAU stated, “It’s at least an 8. I’m very sure that this is the individual who shot me on July 4, 1969.”



### **PAGE 3 OF 5**

I then asked MAGEAU if he was shown any other photographs during the investigation of this case. MAGEAU indicated that shortly after the shooting, he was shown a number of photographs which he was unable to identify. He indicates that today is the first time he was shown a photograph wherein he was able to identify a responsible.

MAGEAU also indicated that 8–10 years ago when he was living in the City of Oxnard he was shown some photographs by the Oxnard Police Department and was unable to make an identification at that time. It should be noted that I was responsible for having Oxnard Police Department show a group of photographs to MAGEAU of a suspect that had been developed by the Department of Justice.

MAGEAU was asked if he had heard any of the recent publicity regarding the Zodiac Case. MAGEAU indicated that he had read in a newspaper that a suspect who was a disabled school teacher had been identified as a possible responsible in the Zodiac killings. MAGEAU indicated there was no picture with this article, and he has seen no TV coverage regarding the Zodiac Case recently.

MAGEAU indicates he has never seen the face of the individual he had identified today with the exception on July 4, 1969.



### **PAGE 4 OF 5**

MAGEAU was then asked if he had ever attended in 1969, a painting party at Darlene FERRIN’S residence. MAGEAU indicated that he had not, but he had heard about this party. He was asked if he knew the name of Ron ALLEN. MAGEAU indicated that name sounded familiar, but he can’t remember for sure. He was then asked if he knew the name of Leigh ALLEN. MAGEAU responded, “I don’t think so.”

MAGEAU was then asked about a lengthy rap sheet which I had obtained from the Department of Justice on him; wherein, he had used approximately 33 aliases. MAGEAU viewed this listed aliases and indicated that he had, in fact, used most of those names. MAGEAU indicated that he had previously been in quite a bit of trouble; that he was now a Born Again Christian and that he attended the First Assembly of God Church as well as the First Baptist Church. And, in fact, the woman with him and her husband were both church members in both of these churches, and they all attended. He was presently residing with this woman and her husband and doing handyman work for them. My impression of MAGEAU at this time that he is sincere in his religious beliefs and has put his lawless past behind him.



### **PAGE 5 OF 5**

MAGEAU indicated that he would cooperate with this investigation in any way possible. I indicated to MAGEAU that it may be necessary to fly him up to Northern California for a more in-depth interview. He indicated that he would have no objection to doing this. An appointment will be made with MAGEAU for a more in-depth interview.

MAGEAU viewed this listed aliases and indicated that he had, in fact, used most of those names. MAGEAU indicated that he had previously been in quite a bit of trouble; that he was now a Born Again Christian and that he attended the First Assembly of God Church as well as the First Baptist Church. And, in fact, the woman with him and her husband were both church members in both of these churches, and they all attended. He was presently residing with this woman and her husband and doing handyman work for them. My impression of MAGEAU at this time that he is sincere in his religious beliefs and has put his lawless past behind him.

MAGEAU indicated that he would cooperate with this investigation in any way possible. I indicated to MAGEAU that it may be necessary to fly him up to Northern California for a more in-depth interview. He indicated that he would have no objection to doing this. An appointment will be made with MAGEAU for a more in-depth interview.

recwcxNeKvutZunIR,Ralph Spinelli claims he knows who Zodiac was,1990-12-14,,"reclf44XCEHjVBWFJ,recQdEdKh7CEP2mPw","From Zodiac Unmasked:

**Friday, December 14, 1990**

Ralph Spinelli, lying in a cell on his fiftieth birthday, sweated into the thin mattress. Jim Overstreet, San Jose P.D., had arrested him as a suspect in at least nine armed robberies of restaurants. Spinelli knew he could be prosecuted as a career criminal. He had been arrested in Oregon in 1972 for a series of armed robberies of restaurants and served two years of a ten-year sentence for them. Facing a thirty-year sentence, he suggested to Overstreet that he had something to trade. In jail, cigarettes, sex, and secrets were three prized commodities. “The best kind of informant is a two-time loser-forty-five to fifty who knows if he goes up one more time he’s going to die in the can,” said a detective. “When he turns to us, he has nowhere else to go—he becomes as zealous as a cop.” The cops had a “twist,” a hammer, on Spinelli and he was “working his beef.”

“I know the real name of Zodiac,” Spinelli said finally. “It was his ace.”

Spinelli began to talk in halting tones and rapid cadence. But for all he said, it was just enough to get Overstreet on the hook. Overstreet realized Spinelli might be inventing a story—a very good chance of that. However, he could not ignore what might be a valid tip. Zodiac was the biggest case there was. He left a message for retired Detective Bawart and Bawart rang him right back. “Spinelli is currently incarcerated in the Santa Clara County jail,” advised Overstreet. “He won’t divulge what information he has regarding Zodiac unless some kind of deal is made regarding the present charges against him.” Bawart sighed. He had heard such claims about Zodiac before. “I’ll get back to you,” he replied, and called Conway.

“There was this guy Spinelli living in San Jose,” Bawart told me later, “pulled a bunch of stickups and they caught him and he said, ‘Get ahold of Vallejo P.D. I’ll tell you all about a case they’re real interested in.’ They called us, and Conway and I went down and interviewed him on his birthday.” Vallejo Police Captain Roy Conway already knew Spinelli. His name had been prominent in the Vallejo area during the forties, fifties, and sixties. Connections with organized crime were suspected.

Conway, a Vallejo police officer since 1965, had worked with Mulanax, since retired. He was presently commander of the Investigation Division, but the night Ferrin was murdered and Mageau terribly wounded, he had been a sergeant and he and Richard Hoffman had been the first policemen at the scene. Conway personally verified the authenticity of descriptions Zodiac mailed to the press back in 1969. He believed Zodiac had committed those shootings. An anonymous phone call to the Vallejo P.D. had been made from a phone booth near Arthur Leigh Allen’s home and near where Tucker kept his car.

Conway and Bawart drove to the Santa Clara lockup, checked their guns, and went in to see Spinelli. He was being held on $500,000 bail while awaiting trial on the charges. The prisoner was anxious. Spinelli knew how much trouble he was in. Though he could go in for what amounted to life, Spinelli still refused to budge. He would not name the individual he knew as Zodiac without being offered a deal. “I want all charges against me dropped,” he insisted.

“Out of the question,” said Bawart.

“We refuse to make any sort of deal like that,” said Conway.

“And just how do you know this person is Zodiac?” asked Bawart.

“He threatened me several days before the killing of Paul Stine, the San Francisco cabdriver. He wanted to show me how tough he was. He told me he was going to San Francisco and kill a cabbie for me,” said Spinelli. “The next day or so a cabdriver was killed in San Francisco and the Zodiac took credit for it.” A police report confirmed Spinelli and Allen had had fights in the past.

After a long discussion, Spinelli agreed to give Zodiac’s true name to his lawyer, Craig Kennedy, a deputy public defender of Santa Clara County. Throughout the remainder of the month, several meetings were held between Kennedy and his immediate boss, Bryan Schechmeister. He refused to agree that no further information would be divulged without a definite deal given to their client. Thus Conway and Bawart still refused to do. They could play hardball too. It would be interesting to see who blinked first.


**Thursday, January 31, 1991**
**Page 2**

Conway received a call from Kennedy. “I can give you the name that Spinelli has,” he said. The other side had caved.

Conway waited silently, although he already thought he knew the answer.

“It’s Leigh Allen. Arthur Leigh Allen.”

Conway let out a slow breath. He already knew all about Lee Allen. He got Bawart on the phone immediately. “LEE” was in the Zodiac cipher. It was the name Allen had worn on his smock at Ace Hardware. Conway contacted Inspector Armstrong in San Francisco. “Yes,” Armstrong said, “one of the primary suspects back in the early 1970s was Arthur Leigh Allen.” He also verified that Allen’s name had never been published in any media to his knowledge. The only persons knowing his name were law enforcement people and only those involved in the actual Zodiac investigation, or someone Allen might have bragged to such as medical personnel at Atascadero and some coworkers at an auto parts store in Sonoma.

“Arthur Leigh Allen and Spinelli were acquaintances way back when,” Bawart told me later, “and he [Allen] approached him and told him he wanted to be an enforcer for him. The guy [Spinelli] owned a topless bar. He admitted he was the Zodiac, said Spinelli, and said, ‘To show you, I’m going to go to San Francisco and kill a guy.’ That was shortly before the Stine killing. Then he supposedly came back and said, ‘I’m responsible for the Stine killing.’ I know this guy Spinelli fairly well from his criminal past. I didn’t know whether to believe him or not.”

Spinelli might have invented his story and been trying to win favor. Even if what he said was true, it was not solid supporting evidence that would hold up in court. It was fruit from a tainted tree. But how had Spinelli known to come up with the name Leigh Allen in the first place?

**Wednesday, February 6, 1991**

Conway and Bawart drove to the State Department of Justice, Sacramento Homicide Unit, to see Agent Fred Shirisago. This branch was currently the repository for all the Zodiac cases in the multitude of jurisdictions where the killer had struck. A constant refrain from amateur sleuths regarding the state DOJ was that some at the top level were not always responsive to their information and theories. “They don’t always take my information seriously,” one told me. “Further one guy claimed that the Riverside killing invalidated my material and he had proof Zodiac did not kill Cheri Jo Bates. He claimed the information provided by Pam, Darlene’s sister, was not valid as it was too old. The handprinting I provided by my expert was that ‘it looked similar,’ but after a killing in Martinez, they said it was not Zodiac’s. Yet he refused to allow the other expert, Mr. Morrill, a chance to examine said handprinting.”

This was not Toschi’s approach. “Just let people know you appreciate getting their clues on how to catch Zodiac,” he told me. “I always acknowledge receipt of a person’s letter, especially if it appears to have some substance or is sincere. I never know when I’ll get a letter that will make or break the case.” Shirisago gave Conway all the reports pertaining to the investigation of Arthur Leigh Allen, records that demonstrated San Francisco detectives, specifically Armstrong and Toschi, had conducted the primary investigation on Allen. They spoke with Armstrong, then Conway contacted Mel Nicolai, now retired. Nicolai agreed with Armstrong that the media had never revealed the name of Lee Allen as a suspect in the Zodiac investigation. Bawart followed the local papers devotedly. He too knew Allen’s name had never been linked publicly with Zodiac. Spinelli had to have had personal contact with Lee Allen or with a close friend of his. In no other way could he have come up with the name.

“Were there any reasons for Spinelli to lie about the information?” I asked Bawart. “A grudge? A lighter sentence of some sort?”

“Allen had gotten in a fight with Spinelli,” he told me. “Showed up at his house and kicked in the door and beat him up. And yes, he provided the information in exchange for a lighter sentence.”

Through Sacramento, Conway requested the FBI Director’s aid, Teletyping the following:

“The latent fingerprint section is requested to provide Sacramento with photographs of all latent fingerprints developed during the Zodiac investigation, Latent Case No A-10042. The latent fingerprint section is further requested to search the latent fingerprints developed in the Zodiac case through the Automated Identification System and the Automated Latent Systems Model and National Unidentified Latent File. Sacramento is not aware of the requested search as previously being conducted. The photographs of latent prints on file with the Identification Division are being sought at the request of the Vallejo California Police Department, who intends to run the prints, search through the California Department of Justice Automated Latent Prints System [ALPS].”

Compared against every suspect in the Zodiac case, prisoners and military personnel, there was no match. How had Zodiac done it?


**Thursday, February 7, 1991**

Bawart contacted Larry Ankron, a psychologist for VICAP at Quantico. Ankron knew all about Zodiac. Bawart told him all Armstrong, Toschi, and Mulanax had learned back in 1971, then gave him the information that Spinelli had provided—the name of Arthur Leigh Allen. The bureau, as it turned out, already had a file (their largest single file in the Zodiac case) on this individual. In Ankron’s estimation, Zodiac got his much of his fun from taunting the police and reliving his murders through souvenirs he kept as from the violent acts themselves. “My studies,” he said, “show that persons who commit these types of crimes many times keep souvenirs or trophies from these criminal acts. They will take some type of article from their victims such as identification, pieces of clothing, and so on. This is so they can keep these in a hidden place and relive the incident many times over. They will keep journals and newspaper clippings of the crimes themselves. Those who keep these souvenirs have ingenious hiding places within their residences such as false walls, hidden safes, and so on. Many times these individuals will have a storage place at another location where they keep their souvenirs.”

Possibly Zodiac’s trophies were underwater at a site such as Lake Berryessa or in the walls of a trailer. Ankron believed the killings were still going on, or had gone on until recently. After all, Zodiac said he wasn’t going to write anymore and would make his killings appear as accidents. “The only reason I can find that the murders had stopped,” he said, “is that the man responsible had moved away—although the Zodiac crimes committed elsewhere would be readily identifiable because of his well-known M.O.]. He might have died. Or the police had come very close to apprehending him.” Many who had seen Zodiac or been part of Leigh Allen’s alibi had died mysteriously. A caretaker’s daughter saw Zodiac speeding away from Blue Rock Springs, and died several years after in a car accident. A landlady who could have provided Allen with an alibi perished from a heart attack. Mr. William White, a neighbor [whose son joined the Vallejo] force, had seen Allen return home on the day of the Lake Berryessa murder, and died shortly afterward. Frank Gasser, the raccoon hunter who had peered in the white Impala on Lake Herman Road the night of the murders, perished in a freak accident, dying suddenly two years later when he struck his head on a coffee table.

“You know,” Bawart told me, “when you investigate so many cases you get to be jaded to the degree that you have so many coincidences you just don’t believe in coincidences after a while. Where there’s smoke there’s fire.” He visited Ace Hardware, where Allen had once worked, and contacted Leigh’s coworker George Hieb. An ex-city employee, Hieb had worked at the Corporation Yard for many years. In his retirement he was working at Ace Hardware.

“Do you know Arthur Leigh Allen?” asked Bawart.

“I know him quite well,” said Hieb. “I visit his home almost on a weekly basis.” Though Leigh’s mother had died, he still kept his basement bedroom, though he could have control of the entire house. Hieb too had seen Allen’s guns. “A number of revolvers—I think they’re .22-caliber, and at least one semiautomatic pistol, but I don’t know the caliber.” Because Allen had been arrested by the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Department for molesting a small boy, the suspect was a felon. Consequently, he was not allowed by law to own any of the weapons Hieb had seen. But in the decade that Hieb had known Allen, he had never discussed the Zodiac case with him. That was puzzling. Leigh had discussed it with others, even led people to think in that particular direction. Bawart cautioned Hieb not to mention the visit, then re-interviewed a number of people who had information about Allen. As much current information about the suspect as possible had to be gathered before they confronted him.

Near the detached garage on the northeast side of 32 Fresno Street sat a broken-down blue “General Motors-type” auto. According to Hieb’s information, Allen owned an older black G.M. vehicle. In the driveway were an older-model white Mercedes-Benz and light-blue Volkswagen Karmann Ghia. Allen possessed a white pickup, and Darlene Ferrin had been followed by an American-made white sedan. A silver or ice-blue ’66 Chevy with California plates had been seen at Lake Berryessa the day of the attack.

To get to the lay of the land, Bawart drove over to 1545 Broadway, where Allen kept a boat and trailer. The location was a single-story residence on the west side of Broadway. To the north of the building stood a detached double-car garage packed with household goods. There were storage areas—places where Allen might have concealed weapons—a large lean-to garage, forty feet long and twenty feet deep, and a second storage area at the rear. George got out. Behind the garage, wind whipped grass in a vacant field. The scent of the Bay was in the air. In the center of the field stretched a twenty-five-foot-long blue and white sailboat on a trailer, partially draped by a blue tarp. Bawart mysteriously lifted the tarp and saw a California state number, NE2375Z. The boat had its small outboard motor on board, which would allow a person to stay at sea for many days at a time. Bawart also observed an open sailboat some ten feet long. “It looked more like a rowboat,” he said. Bawart jotted into his license notebook—09127FB. In writing or registration letters 32 F were possible, so could be 39127FB. He phoned his assistant, his sister-in-law Heidi said, “Allen’s been unemployed and living on the government for three years,” Conway had told him. “He goes diving at his place—likes Cat sailboats.” Bawart decided that in addition to a search similar to Fresno, the police should at least search the sailboat. But the evidence they sought might be sunken somewhere off the coast, beneath blue lake waters, or under the turgid waters of the Delta.

reccF7qsRM0kbWZ5C,Ralph Spinelli arrested for Portland armed robbery,1971-02-11,,recUJsymsZJwwCLW9,"**Crazy Horse Saloon Owner Held On Warrant**

**FAIRFIELD** — The owner of the Crazy Horse Saloon in rural Fairfield was arrested Thursday and booked in county jail on a governor’s extradition warrant.

Ralph A. Spinelli Jr., is charged with the June 8 armed robbery of Mary’s Club in Portland, Ore. Three men allegedly took $17,000 in the hold-up.

Superior Judge Raymond Sherwin denied a writ of habeas corpus filed yesterday.

Los Angeles attorney Harrison W. Hertzberg, who represents Spinelli, states that Spinelli has been denied his constitutional rights in violation of the fourth amendment (right of search and seizure regulated).

Judge Sherwin noted that the arraigning court is authorized to admit Spinelli to bail in the sum of $5,000.

An affidavit submitted in support of the seizure listed items confiscated from the Crazy Horse Saloon as a result of search in July and authorized by Fairfield municipal Judge Curtis A. Singleton.

Items found included a Lugar pistol, a .38 cal. snub nose revolver, a .45 cal. automatic, false sideburns, a false mustache, a salt and pepper colored man’s wig, and $17,000 in $100 denominations.

The Oregon police have stated that three people were involved in the robbery. One man was possibly salt and pepper in color.

The suspects used a .38 cal. snub nose revolver and a .45 cal. automatic. One suspect was wearing a false mustache and possibly false sideburns.

All four victims in the hold-up identified Spinelli in a line-up according to Oregon police.

Spinelli was arraigned before municipal Judge Wallace Cox in Vallejo.

**Man Once Suspected In Zodiac Case Dies**
By Erin Hallissy
_Chronicle East Bay Bureau_

A man once suspected of being the Zodiac killer, who taunted police and terrorized Northern California with threats of murder, died Wednesday in Vallejo of a heart attack at the age of 58.

In 1971, attention focused on Arthur Leigh Allen when relatives and friends told police that he was acting erratically and that they feared he might be the sadistic slayer who killed at least six people and perhaps as many as 37 between 1966 and 1974.

In his book _Zodiac_, former _Chronicle_ editorial cartoonist Robert Graysmith described Allen during that time as “the strongest choice of most detectives” for the Zodiac killer. Graysmith could not be reached for comment yesterday.

Former San Francisco police detective Dave Toschi said yesterday that Allen was investigated as a suspect in 1971 and his trailer was searched, but there was never enough evidence to file charges against him or any other suspect.

Allen had reportedly told some people that he was the Zodiac killer.

“Mr. Allen was a very, very good suspect,” Toschi said. “We looked into Mr. Allen very closely.”

In the mid-1970s, Allen was convicted of child-molesting charges and sentenced to prison, said Vallejo Police Captain Roy Conway.

Last year, the Vallejo Police Department searched Allen’s home in Vallejo as part of a follow-up investigation into the unsolved case.

“We found some writings, some pipe bombs, some illegal weapons,” Conway said. “None of it was conclusive.”

Conway said Allen, who for many years was unemployed and lived on general assistance, cooperated with police. The officer described Allen as highly intelligent. His interests included diving and Hobie Cat sailboat racing.

Conway said there have been as many as 1,000 suspects in the Zodiac killings.

The killer who called himself “The Zodiac” sent chilling letters with coded clues to newspapers and detectives about a string of murders, which occurred in Vallejo, Lake Berryessa, San Francisco and Riverside.

“It was like he was taunting us and saying, ‘I’m better than you and smarter than you,’” Toschi said. “He actually set out a challenge and said, ‘Catch me if you can.’”

Last year, a Vallejo lawyer held a press conference to announce that his dead brother had been the Zodiac killer. William L. Beeman privately published a two-volume set called _Jack the Zodiac_ in which he wrote that 101 pieces of circumstantial evidence pointed to his brother, Jack Beeman.

recDSp7lU4Djc5Gfi,William Beeman Sr. accuses brother Jack,1991-11-01,,recURm55M69p21vYN,"**Lawyer says: ‘My brother was the Zodiac’ slayer**
_Vallejo man declares he is ‘absolutely certain’ his dead sibling was notorious killer_
_Examiner Staff Report_

VALLEJO — A highly respected Vallejo attorney says he is “absolutely certain” his deceased brother was the notorious and boastful Zodiac killer who murdered at least six people in California in the late 1960s.

William Beeman Sr., 70, who has practiced law for 37 years, accused his elder brother, Jack Steadman Beeman — who he said died of emphysema in Arizona in 1984 — during a news conference he held Thursday morning at the Solano County fairgrounds.

Beeman told a throng of reporters he would reveal the killer’s identity only after explaining how he had come to solve the mystery.
“I will just refer to him as ‘Jack the Zodiac,’” Beeman said.

Beeman then listed some reasons why he believed “Jack” was the Zodiac. These included such things as Jack’s shoe size, his alleged hatred of women, the fact that he’d worn a Timex watch and every month read the latest issue of _True Detective_ magazine, his habit of always misspelling common words, and that he was a devotee of astrology.

But witnesses also described the Zodiac as being about 5 foot 9 and 145 pounds. Jack Beeman, who repaired televisions and other electric appliances, was over 6 feet tall and more than 200 pounds.

William Beeman conceded his belief is based only on circumstantial evidence he began compiling in 1990 after reading _Zodiac,_ by San Francisco author Robert Graysmith.

And Beeman denied that the news conference had anything to do with his recently self-published book titled _Jack._

Beeman said he had not taken his “evidence” to any investigators in Solano County, where three of Zodiac’s murders were committed.

While short on conclusions, the event was long on drama. The sister of one of the Zodiac’s victims peered at a picture of Jack Beeman in the book before exclaiming that he looked like a man who once fixed the family’s television set.

“I think there may be something here, but I just don’t know,” said Pam Huckabay, whose sister, Darlene Ferrin, was killed in Vallejo in 1969. “I just want the man who killed my sister brought to justice. I don’t want another book, or another movie.”

The Zodiac killings in Northern California began in December 1968 when two high school students were fatally gunned down while parked at a lovers lane.

After the killings, Zodiac would write to newspapers, bragging about his crimes and boasting he would never be caught.

The last known letter from the Zodiac came in 1974. He has not been heard from since.

**A Link to Murder in Riverside**
_By Paul Avery, Chronicle Correspondent_

Riverside — Persuasive evidence turned up by _The Chronicle_ — that Zodiac murdered a beautiful Riverside college coed four years ago — may provide new and important clues leading to the capture of California’s mystery killer.

And a young San Bernardino woman, who eight months ago escaped a weird murder attempt by Zodiac, has given _The Chronicle_ additional details as to what he looks like.

A number of chilling similarities link the savage October 30, 1966, knife slaying of 18-year-old Cheri Jo Bates with Zodiac — whose most recent boast is that he has killed 14 persons.

Until now, police have doubted this claim. They had felt he actually killed five persons in attacks in San Francisco, at Lake Berryessa, and around Vallejo, which began with a lovers’ lane ambush murder of two teenagers in December 1968.


### **Messages**

Homicide detectives didn’t even tie together these crimes until mid-1969, when Zodiac began corresponding with _The Chronicle_, starting his macabre messages:
“This is the Zodiac speaking.”

At the time of Miss Bates’ murder, Zodiac had not yet proclaimed his infamous name. The killing, in spite of certain bizarre circumstances, until now has been considered the work of some rejected school suitor.

The murder happened this way:

Miss Bates, an honor student, drove her Volkswagen to Riverside City College early on a Sunday evening to draw some books from the school library. She spent 20 minutes selecting them, then returned to the car at 6:10 p.m. with two friends.

She started the ignition key, stepped on the gas pedal, and heard a coarse grinding noise as the engine wouldn’t catch.


### **Passenger**

Suddenly, a man appeared — apparently either a passing stranger or, as some have suspected, the man who had disabled her car.

Other suggested the killer had rigged a nearby streetlight to blink out, sending Miss Bates into darkness as she walked toward a parking lot.

She and the man talked briefly. Witnesses later said they appeared friendly. She seemed neither frightened nor annoyed.

Then she moved toward the alley beside the library and disappeared into the darkness.

Her body was found at 6:30 a.m. the next morning, sprawled face-down and slashed. Her throat had been cut. She had been stabbed multiple times.

Her lightweight clothing was torn in several places, suggesting a violent struggle. One of her shoes was missing.


### **Envelopes**

Two unstamped envelopes were found outside the Riverside Police Department and the Riverside Press-Enterprise newspaper office about a month later.

Each contained a printed greeting card and a handwritten note beginning, “BATES HAD TO DIE — THERE WILL BE MORE.”

The letters bore block-printed addresses similar to Zodiac’s later style, including a distinct slant to the left, crossed “7” figures, and peculiar “K” forms.

Handwriting experts compared them with Zodiac’s later letters and declared “unquestionable similarities.”

A third note, found scribbled on a desk at the Riverside City College Library, read in part:
“SHE WANTED TO DIE. THERE WILL BE MORE.”

Experts believe this may have been the first “confession” letter Zodiac ever wrote.


### **Details**

Police later discovered her car’s ignition coil wire had been pulled loose. Grease smears were found on her clothing, and a man’s Timex wristwatch with a torn band was recovered nearby.

Hair samples clutched in her hand showed she fought her killer fiercely.

There was no sexual molestation.

The killer left no fingerprints.


### **Conclusion**

For years, Riverside police insisted the case was not connected with Zodiac. Captain Cross of the homicide detail told _The Chronicle_ that they once suspected a fellow student who was later cleared.

But in October 1970, Zodiac sent a letter to _The Chronicle_ hinting that “there’s a murder some of your boys in Riverside can’t solve.”

Within days, police in Riverside and San Francisco compared files.

The typewriter used on the 1966 notes matched the type in Zodiac’s known correspondence.

The similarities in phrasing, handwriting, and method were too strong to ignore.

Captain Cross and San Francisco Homicide Inspector David Toschi agreed that the Bates murder now “must be seriously considered Zodiac’s first known killing.”


### **Car**

An even more recent connection comes from another woman — Mrs. Kathleen Johns, 23, who says Zodiac tried to murder her and her infant daughter near Modesto last March.

She told police she was lured into his car by an offer of help after her own had broken down. He drove aimlessly along country roads for more than an hour before she escaped with her child into a field.

The man, she said, had a round face, light hair, and a heavy voice with a slight drawl — closely matching composite sketches of Zodiac.


### **Identification**

Shown a police artist’s sketch of the cabdriver Paul Stine’s killer, Mrs. Johns said: “That’s him.”

Asked that night to describe the attack, she trembled and said, “My God — he said he was going to kill me and my baby.”

She later identified the man as Zodiac after reading of the murders in the papers.

She still receives threatening letters signed “Z.”

Her story was corroborated by several highway patrolmen who had earlier seen her car abandoned and the suspect’s vehicle cruising the area.


### **Epilogue**

The evidence now strongly indicates that Zodiac first killed in Riverside, continued through the Bay Area, and may still be active.

Police in both cities have exchanged complete files and are working jointly with the FBI to analyze latent fingerprints and the anonymous “Bates had to die” notes.

**Cheri Jo Bates — 1966 murder victim.**

Zodiac’s confirmed toll — including Bates — would then stand at six known victims, with eight additional possible cases under review.

recAJjplezVzhY2GE,Dr. D.C.B. Marsh dares Zodiac to reveal name,1969-10-22,,recXWIp8s3P3TAYiu,"# **Cipher Expert Dares Zodiac To ‘Tell’ Name**
_By Will Stevens_

A challenge perhaps unique in the annals of American crime was injected today into the bizarre case of the killer who begins his letters to newspapers: “This is Zodiac speaking.”

The challenge came from Dr. D.C.B. Marsh, president of the American Cryptogram Association, and one of the world’s distinguished cryptographers.

A scholarly, soft-voiced professor of mathematics at Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colo., Dr. Marsh told _The Examiner_ today:

“The killer wouldn’t dare—as he has claimed in letters to the newspaper—to reveal his name in a cipher to established cryptogram experts.”

### **Incomplete Truth**

“He has, to quote Edgar Allen Poe, that ‘any cipher devised by man can be solved by man.’”

“Zodiac” has not told the complete truth in his cipher messages to _The Examiner_, _The Chronicle_, and _The Vallejo Times-Herald,_ Marsh suggested.

“Zodiac” has not done this, Marsh suggested, because to tell the complete truth in relation to his name—in cipher code—would lead to his capture.

### **Original Claim**

A modest scholar, Dr. Marsh then laid down this challenge:

“I invite ‘Zodiac’ to send to _The American Cryptogram Association,_ care of Dr. D.C.B. Marsh, president, at 4164 Mt. Golden, Colo., 80401, a cipher code—however complicated—which will, when solved, honestly include his name—for study by myself and my colleagues in the association.”

Since the Dec. 20 night “Zodiac” shot to death the first of five victims—a 16-year-old boy and girl in a lovers’ lane near Vallejo—he has mailed intricate code messages in cipher to _The Examiner,_ _Chronicle,_ and _Times-Herald._

He claimed, in his original cipher message, that it revealed his identity.

Most of the code was deciphered, subsequently, by Donald G. Harden, a Salinas high school teacher, and his wife.

That message, as decoded by Harden, began:

“I like killing people because it is so much fun it is more fun than killing wild game.”

But there were 18 garbled letters at the end—never deciphered.

Today, Dr. Marsh told _The Examiner:_

“That first code was complicated and the man obviously knew what he was doing.”

But it never, Dr. Marsh said, included the true identity of “Zodiac.”

recMSeliSPFlH7kGX,Dr. Marsh interviewed in Colorado about Zodiac and cryptograms,1969-11-14,,reczWfX32jtMQCIm8,"**Golden Cryptographer Decodes Messages Sent by Zodiac Killer**
_By Bob Duncan_

There is an admitted killer running loose in San Francisco who claims to have taken the lives of seven human beings, although police can link him with only five. He apparently enjoys taunting police by sending cryptograms about himself and his murders. Authorities have stated publicly they believe the man to be sane. There are those who doubt he is.

The killer calls himself Zodiac and evidently enjoys reading news of himself in the press as he sends ciphered (coded) messages to that medium. His age is guessed at 35 to 45. Two sketches exist which might be likenesses of the man and authorities have circulated these in hopes of someone spotting him.

Zodiac has threatened to flatten the tires of school buses and “pick off the kiddies as they come bounding out.” Either the man did not intend carrying out this threat or police presence aboard school buses scared him off as he did not kill any of the children—yet.

Dr. Donald G. B. Marsh, a mathematician at the Colorado School of Mines, has been asked by the San Francisco police department to decipher the cryptograms (coded messages). Dr. Marsh has been in the deciphering game since the age of 16 when his first interest and interest in ciphers first drew him when he first saw the film serial “The Mastermind of Mr. Moto.” He has been a member of the Association for 30 years and estimates approximately 4000 others share his tremendous solution of over 40,000 “crunchy” objects. Since 1954 he has edited the foreign cipher section of the Association’s journal and was elected President of the Association in 1964 and is now serving his second term in that office. Although now he is involved with Zodiac, Dr. Marsh states, “My most pleasant satisfying accomplishment in the field to date has been solving a cipher (written in French) by the fabulous Casanova. So far as I can determine, this chapter will only be enjoyed by the late William Friedman, one of the greatest cryptologists, who, although never published his solution.”

Dr. Marsh, a modest man, is probably one of the most highly respected persons living in cryptography. Though he may not boast of his successes, the mere fact that the San Francisco police sought him at all is proof of his esteem and reliability.

Thoroughly modest, Dr. Marsh is aware of his capabilities and has issued a challenge to Zodiac to send him a code that would reveal his true identity. Dr. Marsh says he can identify the man by the type of cipher he uses.

The latest message from Zodiac has yet to be forwarded to Dr. Marsh for study. He speculates that insurance by the police department may delay the transfer of immediate area.

Because of involvement in many other code deciphering mysteries including one that is as well known as San Francisco police, Dr. Marsh has a special privilege of knowing the mystery killer’s method of encoding. He says that the most important thing to know about a cipherer is his personality.

During an interview with Dr. Marsh, he talked about how he became involved with the case.

“On the evening of August 5th, 1969, I received a telephone call from Will Stevens, staff writer of _The San Francisco Examiner._ After introducing himself and asking me if I had heard about the killing, he told me that the killer had taken place in the vicinity of Vallejo, California.”

During a long discussion with Will Stevens, he supplied me with the information I had not heard concerning Zodiac. I began my study of the ciphers. Then Stevens told me that Donald Harden and his wife, a school teacher in Salinas, had worked on the ciphers and solved them.”

“I was sent the first cipher which the killer refers to in his messages as ‘This cipher is my name.’”

Dr. Marsh explained further that he found the cipher to be “A variation of the Broken Rail Fence,” a form of transposition in which letters of the message are rearranged—but the message remains the same.

Marsh knew the type of mind he was dealing with—practical and systematic.

Copies of the ciphers reached me by mail a few days later and I began a study of them when I was shortly interrupted by another telephone call from San Francisco stating that Donald Harden of Salinas had reported solving the ciphers, saying that the message began, “I like killing people.” I was asked whether or not I could verify his solution. With this lead given me, I was able to recover the message within an hour, arriving at the same solution as Mr. Harden.

“Since this time, the _Examiner_ has very graciously kept me informed of developments in the case (including two further murders) and I have been interviewed and taped by a San Francisco ‘all-news’ radio station and a lieutenant of their Homicide Bureau. Further messages have been received by the police and news media, linking the same man to all five murders, but no further ciphers have been received (or, if received, they have not been released to the public).”

“As submitted to the newspapers, the August ciphers employed various geometric symbols and letters of the alphabet (some reversed, some inverted). The three portions incorporated the same symbols, indicating the likelihood that the same method of encipherment was used in each case. Each section consisted of these symbols neatly printed in 8 x 17 rectangular arrays. When deciphered the three, collectively, composed a single, rather wild, message. The killer did not explicitly reveal his name as promised, but the terminal 18 symbols, when transliterated consistently with the intelligible portion of the message, remain an enigma. They read, ‘E B E O R I E T E M E T H H P I T I.’ They could have been used merely as nulls (symbols to fill in a design, such as the rectangles employed by the writer); they could represent some secondary encipherment which has not yet been discovered; they could be an anagram, although this does not seem to conform with the other portion of the cipher.

“In my opinion, some errors of encipherment, as well as the use of the various symbols rather than simple letters or numbers, indicate that ‘Zodiac,’ as the murderer now refers to himself, is not an experienced cryptographer. Each symbol represents a unique letter of the alphabet, but nearly every letter of the alphabet was assigned more than one symbolic equivalent. These multiple substitutes and the omission of word spaces made the ciphers more difficult than simple substitution ciphers found in many newspapers and puzzle magazines, but it would not require an expert in cryptography to devise either of these complications.”

Dr. Marsh is currently working on the latest of Zodiac’s cryptograms which he read in a newspaper. Though he is not a policeman, Dr. Marsh is anxious toward the challenge of decoding the message and of being an aid to the police in bringing the killer to justice.

However, Stefani was unable to join her. A short while later, sometime between 4:30 and 5:00 p.m., friends of Cheri’s drove past the Bates’ house and observed Cheri’s distinctive vehicle still parked in her driveway. In 1966, the RCC library had unusual Sunday hours of operation in that it was open from 1:00 to 5:00 p.m. and again from 6:00 to 9:00 p.m. In other words, the library was closed during the 5 o’clock hour.
Another friend thought she saw Cheri heading toward campus in her Volkswagen around 6:15 p.m.3 Four fellow students∗ who knew Cheri entered the library at about 7:15 p.m. and stayed until closing. None of the four saw Cheri at any point during their time in the library. But at least one of the four had noticed her easily recognizable car parked on Terracina Drive, just outside the library.2,4 In fact, no one interviewed by police could say, definitively, that he or she had seen Cheri in or around the RCC library on the night of her murder. 
The closest anyone came to confirming Cheri’s presence was an unnamed male librarian who said he “thought he saw” Cheri during the Sunday-evening session. Unfortunately, he couldn’t provide an exact time.

two San Jose
girls to death

By JOHN STANTON

SAN JOSE — Two teen-age girls, each stabbed more than 50 times, were found dead Sunday evening under a cluster of oak trees on a peaceful hillside near their home.

Police searched rugged underbrush around the knoll—near New Almaden — today for clues to the slayings, which detectives admitted shocked them with its brutality and apparent senselessness.

They were Deborah Gaye Furlong, 14, of 697 Briarcliff Drive, and Kathy Reyne Snoozy, 15, of 748 Azule Ave., San Jose.

Their battered bodies were spotted about 8:20 p.m. by a passing horseback rider.

Barton L. Collins, chief of detectives, said the girls were fully clothed.

“Both of them were stabbed more than 50 times with a pocket knife in the throat, chest and back. They were not sexually molested. You tell me the motive,” Collins said.

This morning 14 officers combed the area at the end of Cahalan Avenue, where the bodies were found, looking for some clue. They found footprints and made plaster casts of them.

Police are also making a house-to-house canvass of the neighborhood to see if they can find anyone who might have seen the girls before they were slain.

Apparently the girls were killed somewhere else in the hilltop area and dumped at the spot their bodies were found, Collins said.

The girls, both students at Oak Grove High School, had left their South San Jose homes about noon to take a picnic. They took sandwiches and a Thermos jug of a fruit drink with them and headed toward a 200-foot hill near their subdivision homes.

When they failed to return by 6 p.m., Deborah’s father, Glen Furlong, and Kathy’s parents, Wilfred and Elna Snoozy, b e g a n looking for them.

Furlong, 38, a senior associate engineer at IBM, said he found their bicycles locked by chain to a fence at the bottom of the hill.

As Furlong and the Snoozy couple were searching for their daughters, they heard of the discovery of the bodies and went to the scene, about two blocks west of Calahan Avenue and three-quarters of a mile south of Blossom Hill Road.

KATHY SNOOZY

The parents identified the victims as their daughters.

Collins said a horseback rider who spotted the bodies had told a motorcyclist to call police.

The hill area is a popular spot with cyclists and horsemen, Collins said.

The picnic jug carried by the girls was found about 25 feet from their bodies. Also nearby was a pair of sandals worn by one of the girls.

DEBORAH FURLONG

Collins said the girls were apparently killed between 2 and 4 p.m.

By Paul Avery
Homicide detectives in San Francisco, Vallejo and Napa said they are no closer to catching the cryptic killer than they were ten months ago - unless some clue to his identity is among the hundreds of leads still in the process of being checked out. Zodiac struck last on October 11 when he gunned down cab -driver Paul Stine on Washington street in Presidio Heights. He revealed himself the killer in a letter sent to The Chronicle three days later. Since then he has remained silent.
Without exception, all the investigators assigned to the case feel Zodiac will eventually be caught. ""We'll get him,"" said one. ""We may not know his name at the moment -but we know a lot about him and what we know will finally lead us to him."" Such confidence is based on several factors. There are at least four witnesses who have seen Zodiac when he wasn't wearing the black hood which, like the crossed circle symbol he signs letters with, has become a Zodiac hallmark. There are three persons who have heard his voice.
There are samples of his handwriting, and fingerprints found at murder scenes which may be his, and tire tracks, and other evidence authorities won't disclose. Sooner or later, detectives believe, tthey will find a man who matches the killer's descriptions who will be further identified as Zodiac by eyewitnesses, his voice, evidence, and, possibly, by his own admission.

Until proved a hoax, it is being investigated by authorities.\n\nThe letter demanded that one-third of the purported cipher code message be printed on the front page this afternoon. Publication of the other two portions was demanded of the two San Francisco newspapers in similar letters.\n\n**THREAT TOLD**\n\nIf the cipher is not printed, the claimed murderer wrote, \""I will go on a kill rampage\"" tonight and during the weekend. He threatened to kill more than a dozen people.\n\nVallejo Police Chief Jack E. Stiltz said \""we're not satisfied the letter was written by the murderer, because numerous persons could have learned of the facts. However, it could have been written by the killer. If it is the killer, we would like for him to write more facts to prove it.\""\n\nPolice planned to get a Navy cryptographic expert to examine the cipher, similar to those worked by puzzle fans, to see if it does contain any message. San Francisco police also picked up the other two letters for that purpose. All three were also being checked for fingerprints.\n\n**TEXT OF NOTE**\n\nThe letter received here reads exactly as written:\n\n\""Dear Editor,\n\""I am the killer of the 2 teenagers last Christmas at Lake Herman and the girl last 4th of July. To prove this I shall state some facts which only I & the police know.\n\""Christmas\n\""1. Brand name of ammo Super X\n\""2. 10 shots fired\n\""3. Boy was on back feet to car\n\""4. Girl was lyeing on right side feet to west\n\""4th of July\n\""1. Girl was wearing patterned pants\n\""2. Boy was also shot in knee\n\""3. Brand name of ammo was Western\n\""Here is a cyipher or that is part of one. The other 2 parts have been mailed to the S.F. Examiner & the S.F. Chronicle.\n\""I want you to print the cipher on your front page by Fry afternoon Aug. 1-69. If you do not do this I will go on a kill rampage Fry night that will last the whole week end. I will cruse around and pick of all stray people or coupples that are aone, then move on to kill some more untill I have killed over a dozen people.\""\n\nThe letter was \""signed\"" with what appeared to be a sketch of the cross-hairs in a telescopic rifle sight.\n\nThe envelope, posted in San Francisco Thursday and carrying 24 cents postage, read \""Please Rush To Editor\"" on\n\nSee LETTER page 2\n\n***\n\n**LETTER**\n**From Page 1**\n\nboth front and back.\nIn the cipher were 50 different letters and symbols, most of them repeated from two to seven times in varying, confusing combinations.\nThe two shootings referred to are the double-slaying of teenagers Betty Lou Jensen, 16, and David Faraday, 17, killed off Lake Herman Road shortly after midnight last Dec. 20, and the murder of Mrs. Darlene Elizabeth Ferrin, 22, and critical wounding of Michael R. Mageau, 19, at Blue Rock Springs Park the night of July 4.\nPolice and the sheriff's department said the letter was accurate in recounting facts about the shootings. However, it was pointed out they all could have been learned by a person visiting the sites of the crimes afterward, and perhaps also overhearing comments of officers. A number of the facts were printed in the newpaper, contrary to what the letter said.\nHowever, authorities asked that residents take the letter seriously, pending any determination that it is a hoax. This would mean taking precaustions about driving or walking to lonely spots.\n\n***\n\n**Code Clue by Vallejo 'Killer' Sent Examiner**\n\nA man saying he is the killer of three persons in Vallejo has written newspapers in the Bay Area offering them a clue in code.\n\nTo prove his authenticity the anonymous letter writer offered what he said were facts known only to him and to the police in the unsolved slayings of Darlene Elizabeth Ferrin, 22, of 930 Monterey St., and Thomas Faraday and Bettilou Jensen, both students at Vallejo High School.\n\nVallejo police said that the details in the letter could have been known to persons other than the murderer although officers confirmed that some of the details were not made public.\n\nThe slaying of the two high school students occurred Dec. 20.\n\n**In Cipher**\n\nThe letter named the brand of ammunition — Super X — although this was not disclosed by investigators at the time. He also said that 10 shots were fired and detailed the positions of the body.\n\nPolice said that this information, although not made public, was available to anyone who had been at the scene of the crime on Lake Herman Road.\n\nThe letter writer also detailed the brand of ammunition used in the Ferrin slaying.\n\nHe then offered a clue written in an elaborate cipher with the message split into three parts — one sent to the Vallejo Times, one to the San Francisco Chronicle and one to The Examiner.\n\nPolice are working on the cipher but they said that they would not be convinced it had been sent by the murderer unless the letter writer could come up with more details which were not generally known.\n\n**Call Made**\n\nThe letter to the Examiner was mailed yesterday in San Francisco.\n\nOne reason the police are taking the letter more seriously than the usual crank note is that following the Ferrin slaying July 5, a caller notified police of the killing.\n\nThe anonymous caller confessed to shooting the woman and said he also had killed the teenagers the preceding Christmas. The call was made 30 minutes after the slaying and before it had become generally known in Vallejo.\n\nPolice said that this call seem to fit with the personality of the letter writer. They said they would believe in the authenticity of the letters if more details were disclosed.""}",2026-02-15T17:19:09.000Z,true,"San Francisco, Vallejo, CA",zodiac-press-coverage-8-1-1969,354,recTK2794ZdN7Hf7n,,Media / Legacy,
